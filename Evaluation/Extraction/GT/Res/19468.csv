This paper focuses on the question of European integration, considering whether the	85.08000183105469	201.8836669921875	12.0	425.3448028564453	3
geographic level at which competition takes place differs across the two major segments	85.08000183105469	216.8836669921875	12.0	425.34230041503906	3
of the soft drinks industry: carbonated soft drinks and mineral water. Our evidence	85.08000183105469	231.8836669921875	12.0	425.3374786376953	3
shows firms are competing at the European level in both segments. Interestingly, the	85.08000183105469	246.8836669921875	12.0	425.42527770996094	3

multinationality, rather than increased trade flows. To interpret these results, this paper	85.08000183105469	276.8836669921875	12.0	425.38075256347656	3
uses the new theory of market structure where the essential notion is that in endogenous	85.08000183105469	291.8836669921875	12.0	425.2105255126953	3

In diesem Beitrag wird der Frage nachgegangen, wie sich die europäische Integration	85.08000183105469	483.8836669921875	12.0	425.3423309326172	6

1. Introduction	63.599998474121094	112.4840087890625	10.79998779296875	100.7400131225586	9
This paper applies the new theory of industrial structure (Sutton, 1991, 1998) to the European	63.599998474121094	143.68402099609375	10.79998779296875	468.1729507446289	9
soft drinks industry. Sutton’s major advance was to generate robust and testable predictions from	63.599998474121094	172.0040283203125	10.79998779296875	468.45584869384766	9
the theory of strategic behavior, where robustness means broad regularities that hold across a	63.599998474121094	200.32403564453125	10.79998779296875	468.05265045166016	9
range of benchmark oligopoly models. Unlike the ‘New Empirical IO’ literature in structural	63.599998474121094	228.64404296875	10.79998779296875	468.45487213134766	9
modeling (see Bresnahan, 1989, and Geroski, 1988, for surveys), this then allows a wide set of	63.599998474121094	256.96405029296875	10.79998779296875	468.34061431884766	9
industries to be analyzed. The basic theoretical notion is that in homogeneous ‘Type 1’ industries,	63.599998474121094	285.2840576171875	10.79998779296875	467.7541275024414	9
characterized by exogenous sunk costs, the traditional inverse structure-size relation holds.	63.599998474121094	313.60406494140625	10.79998779296875	467.7721939086914	9
However, in ‘Type 2’ industries, characterized by endogenous sunk costs, as market size becomes	63.599998474121094	341.9240417480469	10.800018310546875	468.0263442993164	9
very large, firms may escalate their advertising and/or R&D expenditure in response, and the	63.599998474121094	370.2440490722656	10.800018310546875	468.0933609008789	9
inverse structure-size relation may break down. Sutton’s own empirical work confirms his	63.599998474121094	398.5640563964844	10.800018310546875	468.09745025634766	9
predictions, combining cross-section regression analysis with industry cases.1 The detailed	63.599998474121094	424.4544982910156	13.229583740234375	468.00003814697266	9
industry histories form the backbone of Sutton (1991); such analysis reveals rather more	63.5999755859375	455.2039794921875	10.800018310546875	467.95697021484375	9
qualitative evidence of the differing mechanisms made explicit in the theoretical framework.	63.5999755859375	483.52398681640625	10.800018310546875	435.4176940917969	9
Although Sutton investigated the soft drinks industry as an example of how the ‘escalation	63.5999755859375	517.843994140625	10.800018310546875	468.25689697265625	10
mechanism’ operates in an endogenous sunk cost industry, this paper extends his analysis in two	63.5999755859375	546.1639404296875	10.800018310546875	467.6881103515625	10
interesting directions. First, we focus on the question of market integration. Over the period that	63.5999755859375	574.4840087890625	10.800018310546875	467.64691162109375	10
Sutton considered, he was able to assume that the soft drinks industry was mainly local, with	63.5999755859375	602.8040161132812	10.800003051757812	468.2564697265625	10
some multinational production. Essentially, it was assumed that a separate advertising outlay was	63.5999755859375	631.1240844726562	10.800003051757812	468.11517333984375	10
necessary to establish a brand image in each member state. This implies that competition within	63.5999755859375	659.4440307617188	10.800003051757812	468.27008056640625	10
Europe was taking place at the national rather than at the EU level. However, in 1987, the Single	63.5999755859375	687.7640991210938	10.800003051757812	468.0140380859375	10

European Act was legislated. If the EU market becomes the relevant competitive market, this is	63.5999755859375	100.2440185546875	10.79998779296875	468.04571533203125	12
equivalent to an increase in market size as firms will have access to a larger geographic area. As	63.5999755859375	128.56402587890625	10.79998779296875	468.11517333984375	13
market size increases, this yields the prediction that the incentive for firms to endogenously	63.5999755859375	156.884033203125	10.79998779296875	468.48583984375	14
escalate advertising expenditure is increased. The integration process may also be expected to	63.5999755859375	185.20404052734375	10.79998779296875	467.75762939453125	15
have some impact on the issue of where to locate production, or indeed, how to organize	63.5999755859375	213.5240478515625	10.79998779296875	468.000244140625	16
distribution. Thus, our first extension is to consider the appropriate geographic level at which	63.5999755859375	241.84405517578125	10.79998779296875	468.22088623046875	17
competition takes place, and interestingly, whether this differs across the two major segments of	63.5999755859375	270.1640625	10.79998779296875	468.4453125	18
the soft drinks industry: carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) and mineral water.	63.5999755859375	298.48406982421875	10.79998779296875	352.670654296875	19
Secondly, Sutton (1991) argues that a first mover may spend more on advertising than would be	63.5999755859375	332.8040466308594	10.800018310546875	467.94732666015625	20
the case under strategic symmetry, but may thereby succeed in relegating an equally efficient late	63.5999755859375	361.1240539550781	10.800018310546875	467.97845458984375	21
entrant to second place. In other words, it may be unprofitable for such a later entrant to attempt	63.5999755859375	389.4440612792969	10.800018310546875	467.67864990234375	22
to equal the leader at the high-quality end of the market, and so its advertising efforts might be	63.5999755859375	417.7640686035156	10.800018310546875	467.9495849609375	23
correspondingly muted. The soft drinks industry may be an example of this phenomenon where in	63.5999755859375	446.0840759277344	10.800018310546875	468.283203125	24
the US, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are dominant firms and have more or less an equal market share	63.5999755859375	474.4040832519531	10.800018310546875	468.0108642578125	25
in the dominant cola segment; competition in advertising has had a large impact on market	63.5999755859375	502.7240905761719	10.800018310546875	467.7362060546875	26
structure. In the EU, by contrast, Sutton argued that Coca-Cola has a first mover advantage	63.5999755859375	531.0440673828125	10.800018310546875	467.93035888671875	27
dating from World War II. This first mover advantage has muted advertising competition, and	63.5999755859375	559.3641357421875	10.800018310546875	467.97479248046875	28
resulted in persistent market dominance. He showed that first, concentration is much lower in the	63.5999755859375	587.6841430664062	10.800003051757812	467.9949951171875	29
EU member states due to the large fringe of small producers, with lower advertising to sales	63.5999755859375	616.004150390625	10.800003051757812	468.1136474609375	30
ratios. Secondly, Coca-Cola’s market share relative to Pepsi is much higher within the cola	63.5999755859375	644.3241577148438	10.800003051757812	468.0552978515625	31
segment. However, it is important to highlight that market size was also much smaller than in the	63.5999755859375	672.6441650390625	10.800003051757812	468.048095703125	32

cross-section empirical evidence in support of Sutton’s theoretical predictions.	63.60033416748047	735.716552734375	9.072006225585938	316.9192886352539	33

US which, in turn, may have reduced the incentive for potential rivals to endogenously escalate	63.5999755859375	100.2440185546875	10.79998779296875	468.07452392578125	35
their advertising expenditure. If market size has increased, the soft drinks industry structure in the	63.5999755859375	128.56402587890625	10.79998779296875	467.98809814453125	35
EU may come to mirror the US more. Sutton was unable to separate the relative influences of	63.5999755859375	156.884033203125	10.79998779296875	468.40557861328125	35
first mover advantage and market size. We provide such an attempt.	63.5999755859375	185.20404052734375	10.79998779296875	324.1092834472656	35
We analyze both segments of the soft drinks industry, using more recent data at the 3-digit level	63.5999755859375	219.5240478515625	10.79998779296875	468.54229736328125	35
of aggregation. Section two provides a brief summary of the underlying theoretical framework,	63.5999755859375	247.84405517578125	10.79998779296875	467.9219970703125	35
based on Sutton (1991). In section three, we first discuss the structural changes that have taken	63.5999755859375	276.1640625	10.79998779296875	468.15374755859375	35
place between 1987 and 1993. Second, we generate empirical predictions, feeding the exogenous	63.5999755859375	304.48406982421875	10.79998779296875	468.09381103515625	35
structural changes into the theoretical framework. Section four assesses whether the evidence on	63.5999755859375	332.8040466308594	10.800018310546875	468.29388427734375	35
concentration and advertising intensity is consistent with the derived hypotheses. It then moves on	63.5999755859375	361.1240539550781	10.800018310546875	468.2923583984375	35
to focus on the competitive strategies followed by the firms themselves, within the context of the	63.5999755859375	389.4440612792969	10.800018310546875	468.06610107421875	35
theoretical framework. Finally, section five summarizes and concludes.	63.5999755859375	417.7640686035156	10.800018310546875	336.1488952636719	35

market structure are now well known: Robinson and Chiang (1996), Lyons and Matraves (1996),	63.5999755859375	514.7239990234375	10.800018310546875	467.8040771484375	36
Matraves (1999) provide summaries of the Sutton (1991) approach. Suffice to say that following	63.5999755859375	543.0440673828125	10.800018310546875	467.8739013671875	36
Schmalensee (1992), we may split industries into two types: Type 1 and Type 2.2 In Type 1	63.5999755859375	568.9345092773438	13.229522705078125	468.0	36
industries (homogeneous/horizontally differentiated products), the traditional inverse structure-	63.5999755859375	599.6840209960938	10.800003051757812	467.9136962890625	36
size relation holds. In Type 2 industries, this relationship may break down due to the notion that	63.5999755859375	628.0040283203125	10.800003051757812	467.7384033203125	36
2 Sutton (Chapters 2 and 3, 1991) provide the formal theoretical exposition for both Type 1 and Type 2 industries.	63.599998474121094	733.84619140625	11.053146362304688	461.6603775024414	37
4	525.5999755859375	6
expenditure on advertising/R&D in order to increase (perceived) quality is a choice variable. It is	63.5999755859375	100.2440185546875	10.79998779296875	468.074462890625	39
this choice that emphasizes the fundamental difference because firms can react to increases in	63.5999755859375	128.56402587890625	10.79998779296875	468.331298828125	40
market size by investing in quality enhancements. The consequent rise in overheads has a	63.5999755859375	156.884033203125	10.79998779296875	467.93060302734375	41
countervailing effect on market structure by increasing the degree of economies of scale. Thus,	63.5999755859375	185.20404052734375	10.79998779296875	467.84393310546875	42
although there appears more room in a larger market, the escalation process raises fixed costs per	63.5999755859375	213.5240478515625	10.79998779296875	467.881103515625	43
firm, possibly even to such an extent that the negative structure-size relation breaks down.	63.5999755859375	241.84405517578125	10.79998779296875	467.7537841796875	44
Certainly, the resulting market structure will be less fragmented than in a Type 1 industry.3	63.5999755859375	267.73443603515625	13.2296142578125	430.4400329589844	45
Consider the question of market integration within this framework. Since market concentration	63.599998474121094	304.4840087890625	10.79998779296875	468.20121002197266	46
results from the interaction between market size and a few key behavioral and technological	63.599998474121094	332.8039855957031	10.800018310546875	468.4655532836914	47
factors, it is extremely important that the correct market definition is used in empirical work.4 We	63.599998474121094	358.6944885253906	13.229522705078125	468.0491714477539	48
provide an attempt to correctly identify the geographic level at which competition takes place.	63.5999755859375	389.4440002441406	10.800018310546875	467.868896484375	49
The criterion that is typically used to measure the degree of integration is the degree of	63.5999755859375	417.7640075683594	10.800018310546875	468.4437255859375	50
international trade: in this case, intra-EU trade. However, although trade is a reasonable indicator	63.5999755859375	446.0840148925781	10.800018310546875	467.94317626953125	51
of integration in production, it is unlikely to capture the relevant market for technology and	63.5999755859375	474.4040222167969	10.800018310546875	468.00738525390625	52
marketing ideas, particularly if firms are multinational. Endogenous sunk costs therefore introduce	63.5999755859375	502.7240295410156	10.800018310546875	468.0098876953125	53
the possibility of intra-firm economies of scope in their international operations.	63.5999755859375	531.0440673828125	10.800018310546875	378.5642395019531	54
The soft drinks industry is an advertising intensive industry. Unlike the results from R&D which	63.5999755859375	565.364013671875	10.800018310546875	468.245849609375	55
can be easily exploited across borders, even if production decisions do remain non-integrated,	63.5999755859375	593.68408203125	10.800003051757812	467.84375	56
advertising is highly dependent on local language, culture and media. This implies that advertising	63.5999755859375	622.0040893554688	10.800003051757812	468.00457763671875	57
is more likely to be incurred in each country, as long as the national market is large enough for	63.5999755859375	650.3240966796875	10.800003051757812	467.96368408203125	58
3 High production economies of scale work in favor of a more negative relation; while greater consumer sensitivity	63.599998474121094	690.4061279296875	11.053207397460938	468.4813003540039	59
to endogenous investments weigh in favor of a shallow (or even positive) relation.	63.60033416748047	704.3875732421875	9.072006225585938	331.71155548095703	59
5	
such spending to be worthwhile. If the relevant production market becomes the EU, but	63.5999755859375	100.2440185546875	10.79998779296875	467.73602294921875	61
advertising costs are incurred in each member state, this twists the balance of the fixed cost	63.5999755859375	128.56402587890625	10.79998779296875	467.6759033203125	62
mechanisms towards the importance of endogenous fixed costs. However, if advertising decisions	63.5999755859375	156.884033203125	10.79998779296875	468.03466796875	63
are taken at the EU level or, as is perhaps more likely, if marketing expertise is transferable across	63.5999755859375	185.20404052734375	10.79998779296875	468.14892578125	64
national borders, then it can be argued that the firms’ corporate strategies are integrated. In other	63.5999755859375	213.5240478515625	10.79998779296875	467.96990966796875	65
words, given investment in firm specific assets, multinational production may be the best route to	63.5999755859375	241.84405517578125	10.79998779296875	467.71453857421875	66
exploit them, particularly as transport costs are high relative to the value of the product, making	63.5999755859375	270.1640625	10.79998779296875	467.9951171875	67
price/quantity decisions more likely to be member state specific.	63.5999755859375	298.48406982421875	10.79998779296875	303.8843688964844	68
3. Structural Change: Any Predictions	63.5999755859375	339.0440368652344	10.800018310546875	198.84475708007812	69
This section considers recent structural changes in the soft drinks industry.5 These are important	63.599971771240234	364.6944885253906	13.22955322265625	467.76013565063477	70
to consider in some detail in order to derive predictions in the light of the theoretical framework.	63.5999755859375	395.4440002441406	10.800018310546875	467.79315185546875	71
First, ‘europeanization’ is discussed, essentially understood as the effect of the Single European	63.5999755859375	423.7640075683594	10.800018310546875	468.3720703125	72
Market (SEM). This predicted effect of the increase of market size on concentration is derived.	63.5999755859375	452.0840148925781	10.800018310546875	467.9183349609375	73
Secondly, we analyze the potential consequences of structural forces on corporate strategy. We	63.5999755859375	480.4040222167969	10.800018310546875	468.0611572265625	74
argue that increased multinationality is the likely outcome of the europeanization process, and this	63.5999755859375	508.7240295410156	10.800018310546875	468.09576416015625	75
will have an impact on the level of concentration in the market. In other words, we use the notion	63.5999755859375	537.0440673828125	10.800018310546875	468.2401123046875	76
of endogenous investment in a firm-specific asset to influence competition in the market.6	63.5999755859375	562.9345092773438	13.229522705078125	424.6800231933594	77
4 Lyons, Matraves and Moffatt (1999) estimate a structural model of concentration and market size, developing an	63.599998474121094	613.84619140625	11.053146362304688	467.8080825805664	78
econometric technique that endogenously determines whether the EU or the member state is the appropriate market	63.60033416748047	627.8275756835938	9.072006225585938	468.1112747192383	78
level for each country (thus consider the geographic dimension rather than the product dimension).	63.60033416748047	639.8278198242188	9.072006225585938	401.7353286743164	78
5 Sutton separates out his analysis of CSDs and mineral water. We do not this as: i) on the demand side, mineral	63.599998474121094	649.84619140625	11.053146362304688	467.93399810791016	78
water has recently become a direct substitute for CSDs; ii) more pragmatically, we use national statistics which are	63.60033416748047	663.8275756835938	9.072006225585938	468.15650177001953	78
typically compiled at the 3-digit level, although we do have some firm level evidence from company accounts.	63.600341796875	675.8278198242188	9.072006225585938	445.26373291015625	78
6 The notion of endogenous sunk costs has a direct parallel in the strategic management literature. When a firm	63.599998474121094	685.84619140625	11.053146362304688	467.92496490478516	78
makes a large sunk investment, this commits them to certain strategies. If the industry is such that they expect rival	63.60033416748047	699.8275756835938	9.072006225585938	468.1344680786133	78
response, they may choose a certain investment to influence rival behavior (Thomas, 1996). For example, Thomas	63.60033416748047	711.8278198242188	9.072006225585938	468.08118438720703	78
shows, using the RTE breakfast cereal industry, that managers may be able to preempt rivals by introducing new	63.60033416748047	723.8280639648438	9.072006225585938	468.2956008911133	78
products with familiar brand names. Given sunk costs in advertising, incumbents have lower costs of product	63.60033416748047	735.8283081054688	9.072006225585938	467.9246292114258	78
6	525.5999755859375	
3.1	63.5999755859375	100.2440185546875	10.79998779296875	15.105598449707031	80
Single European Market	99.10557556152344	100.2440185546875	10.79998779296875	118.02838134765625	81
By 1987, most tariff barriers had already been removed but many non-tariff barriers (NTBs)	63.5999755859375	128.56402587890625	10.79998779296875	467.89910888671875	82
remained. Buigues, Ilzkovitz and Lebrun (1990) identified the soft drinks industry as one with	63.5999755859375	156.884033203125	10.79998779296875	468.21368408203125	83
high NTBs.7 Thus, various benefits from the SEM were expected. First come the direct benefits	63.5999755859375	182.77447509765625	13.22955322265625	468.050537109375	84
associated with the reduction in the cost of trade, due mainly to the decrease in labeling and	63.599998474121094	213.5240478515625	10.79998779296875	467.90665435791016	85
packaging costs and the elimination of costs associated with importing. Secondly, and ex ante	63.599998474121094	241.84405517578125	10.79998779296875	468.0180435180664	86
difficult to predict, there were expected to be dynamic gains due to the increase in competitive	63.600006103515625	270.1640625	10.79998779296875	468.0000915527344	87
pressure. Allowing firms to compete directly with one another in a larger market was expected to	63.600006103515625	298.48406982421875	10.79998779296875	467.7551574707031	88
yield indirect benefits through increased efficiency, lower prices, and wider product variety.	63.600006103515625	326.8040771484375	10.79998779296875	434.5787048339844	89
These forces were not expected to affect all industries equally. Specific to the soft drinks market,	63.600006103515625	361.1240539550781	10.800018310546875	467.8320617675781	90
we emphasize that first, production economies of scale are relatively low and therefore, the	63.600006103515625	389.4440612792969	10.800018310546875	468.0740661621094	91
majority of firms were not previously operating at a cost disadvantage. Any efficiency benefits are	63.600006103515625	417.7640686035156	10.800018310546875	468.0697326660156	92
therefore likely to be low. Secondly, intra-EU trade has not significantly increased (moved from	63.600006103515625	446.0840759277344	10.800018310546875	468.4200134277344	93
4% of production in 1987 to 6% in 1992, compared to the average of 13% in an advertising	63.600006103515625	474.4040832519531	10.800018310546875	467.9386901855469	94
intensive industry).	63.600006103515625	502.7240905761719	10.800018310546875	90.36000061035156	95
introduction which implies preemptive entry if withdrawal costs (in terms of harming the firm’s reputation) are	63.599998474121094	639.8273315429688	9.072006225585938	468.1475601196289	96
high.	63.599998474121094	651.8275756835938	9.072006225585938	20.999664306640625	96
7 Representative examples include: i) 150 Italian municipalities banned plastic containers implying a significant	63.599998474121094	661.84619140625	11.053146362304688	467.9098892211914	96
domestic advantage due to the lower incentive to import (high transport costs of glass); ii) until 1988, it was illegal	63.60033416748047	675.8275756835938	9.072006225585938	468.03247833251953	96
in France to sell ‘diet’ soft drinks that contained aspartame; iii) fiscal measures (e.g., VAT differences, excise	63.60033416748047	687.8278198242188	9.072006225585938	468.1875686645508	96
duties) that effectively discriminated against importers. Emerson et al (1988) estimate that in 1985, EU price	63.60033416748047	699.8280639648438	9.072006225585938	468.25733184814453	96
dispersion was 33.2% when all taxes were included (the average was 19.4% for consumer goods). The European	63.60033416748047	711.8283081054688	9.072006225585938	467.74512481689453	96
Commission estimated the benefits from eliminating: i) the plastic containers restriction as 15-50 million ECU per	63.60033416748047	723.8285522460938	9.072006225585938	467.7857131958008	96
year; ii) the aspartame restriction as 5 million ECU per year.	63.60033416748047	735.8287963867188	9.072006225585938	245.93085479736328	96

Table 2 shows market size by volume and by segment for the ‘Big 4’. Currently, the mineral water	63.599998474121094	371.9239807128906	10.800018310546875	467.9279556274414	154
segment accounts for approximately 40% of the EU market, but is far less important worldwide.	63.599998474121094	400.2439880371094	10.800018310546875	467.90396881103516	155
Focusing on intra-EU differences, the dominant market segment in the UK is CSDs, in Germany	63.599998474121094	428.5639953613281	10.800018310546875	468.52066802978516	156
the two segments are approximately equal, and in both France and Italy, mineral water dominates.	63.599998474121094	456.8840026855469	10.800018310546875	467.9161148071289	157
Reflecting the US pattern, the most popular carbonates flavor in all member states is cola, with a	63.599998474121094	485.2040100097656	10.800018310546875	468.03592681884766	158
share ranging from 41% in France to 49% in the UK to 56% in Greece (Panorama, 1995). Time	63.599998474121094	513.5240478515625	10.800018310546875	468.00614166259766	159
series evidence shows that over recent years, the volume of sales in the UK mineral water	63.599998474121094	541.843994140625	10.800018310546875	467.9184341430664	160
segment has increased dramatically, although from a very low base, and consumption per capita	63.599998474121094	570.1640625	10.800018310546875	468.1403579711914	161
has almost trebled since 1990. In France and Italy, this pattern is completely reversed, the volume	63.599998474121094	598.4840698242188	10.800003051757812	468.0181655883789	162
increase in CSDs is substantially higher than in mineral water. Finally, in Germany, the volume	63.599998474121094	626.8040771484375	10.800003051757812	468.0601577758789	163
increases were almost equal. Table 2 provides some evidence that these two segments are	63.599998474121094	655.1240844726562	10.800003051757812	468.1247329711914	164
becoming closer substitutes over time. CSD manufacturers are also starting to focus on new types	63.599998474121094	683.444091796875	10.800003051757812	468.04801177978516	165

(Beverage Industry, 1997). As market size increases, this raises the incentive to escalate	63.5999755859375	100.2440185546875	10.79998779296875	467.992919921875	168
advertising expenditure (Sutton, 1991).12 This yields Hypothesis 1.	63.5999755859375	126.13446044921875	13.22955322265625	317.63775634765625	169
Hypothesis 1: an increase in market size is associated with an increase in the level of advertising	63.5999755859375	168.884033203125	10.79998779296875	468.052490234375	170
by each surviving firm that, in turn, will tend to increase concentration.	63.5999755859375	197.20404052734375	10.79998779296875	344.2919921875	171

Firms’ Competitive Actions: Changing Corporate Strategy	99.12000274658203	237.52398681640625	10.79998779296875	282.67073822021484	173
First, comes the impact of endogenous sunk costs. Our hypothesis is that the benefits of product	63.60000228881836	265.843994140625	10.79998779296875	467.6722755432129	174
differentiation that lend themselves to advertising and associated firm specific talents, may lend	63.60000228881836	294.16400146484375	10.79998779296875	468.0422706604004	175
themselves to EU development, even if member state specific advertising campaigns are run. As	63.60000228881836	322.4840087890625	10.79998779296875	468.1297950744629	176
discussed in section two, if the integration of corporate strategy is an additional route to market	63.60000228881836	350.8039855957031	10.800018310546875	467.84616470336914	177
integration, firms may view their operations in different EU member states as interrelated, and	63.60000228881836	379.1239929199219	10.800018310546875	468.0505714416504	178
certain stages of the oligopoly game may be played at the EU level.	63.60000228881836	407.4440002441406	10.800018310546875	320.00647354125977	179
Thus, in Type 2 industries such as soft drinks, we cannot assume that integration will result in a	63.60000228881836	441.7640075683594	10.800018310546875	468.05014419555664	180
substantially less concentrated market. This is because the endogenous choice variable of	63.60000228881836	470.0840148925781	10.800018310546875	468.3745460510254	181
advertising is particularly sensitive to market size, and consequently, there may be little or no	63.60000228881836	498.4040222167969	10.800018310546875	467.77792739868164	182
intensification of price competition, with inter-firm rivalry, instead, being channeled into	63.60000228881836	526.7239990234375	10.800018310546875	467.7241554260254	183
endogenous fixed costs.13 Overall, our discussion highlights that, given the nature of the soft	63.60000228881836	552.614501953125	13.229583740234375	467.73593521118164	184
drinks industry, we are not likely to observe increased integration through increased trade flows.	63.59999084472656	583.364013671875	10.800018310546875	467.89903259277344	185
12 The toughness of price competition has increased in the 1990s, in the sense that private label started to take	63.599998474121094	625.84619140625	11.053146362304688	468.13407135009766	186
away market share. Cott Corp. offered comparable quality for its private label products, mostly colas, packaged the	63.59966278076172	639.8275756835938	9.072006225585938	468.2268753051758	186
brands well and sold them for 25% less than Coca-Cola or Pepsi. Cott also developed close relationships with	63.59966278076172	651.8278198242188	9.072006225585938	467.75415802001953	186
distributors (for example, Wal-Mart in the US, Sainsbury in the UK). It has been shown empirically only (the effect	63.59966278076172	663.8280639648438	9.072006225585938	467.9204788208008	186
is theoretically indeterminate) that an increase in the toughness of price competition will tend to increase	63.59966278076172	675.8283081054688	9.072006225585938	468.1594924926758	186
concentration irrespective of whether the industry is characterized by exogenous or endogenous sunk costs	63.59966278076172	687.8285522460938	9.072006225585938	468.08289337158203	186
(Symeonidis, 1997a, 1997b).	63.59966278076172	699.8287963867188	9.072006225585938	116.52478790283203	186
13 Even when the product is not intrinsically tradable so markets are geographically segmented, if ‘taste’	63.599998474121094	709.84619140625	11.053138732910156	467.9998550415039	186
differences are narrowing, then the oligopoly game will involve escalation in advertising at the EU or global level	63.59966278076172	723.8275756835938	9.072006225585938	467.80860137939453	186
and increased multi-market contact.	63.59966278076172	735.8278198242188	9.072006225585938	145.82938385009766	186

Instead, the still separate markets (in terms of production) are likely to become dominated by the	63.5999755859375	100.2440185546875	10.79998779296875	468.03607177734375	188
same set of MNEs. This yields Hypothesis 2.	63.5999755859375	128.56402587890625	10.79998779296875	213.25088500976562	189
Hypothesis 2: the impact of the SEM will come through merger and acquisition activity and	63.5999755859375	168.884033203125	10.79998779296875	467.947265625	190
increased geographic diversification. This will increase concentration at the EU level.	63.5999755859375	197.20404052734375	10.79998779296875	415.0440673828125	191

CSDs are made from concentrate: either small to medium sized firms operating in a local or	63.5999755859375	265.84405517578125	10.79998779296875	467.8934326171875	193

own syrup and franchise a network of regional and/or national bottlers who add sweeteners and	63.5999755859375	322.48406982421875	10.79998779296875	467.982177734375	195

PepsiCo historically had their own networks where independent firms were authorized to bottle	63.5999755859375	379.1240539550781	10.800018310546875	467.96533203125	197
and sell the products within certain geographical regions.14 Bottlers could handle more than one	63.5999755859375	405.0144958496094	13.229583740234375	468.04815673828125	198
brand, but not brands that were in direct competition with one another (i.e., a bottler could handle	63.600006103515625	435.7640075683594	10.800018310546875	468.0715026855469	199
Pepsi and Fanta but would not then handle Coca-Cola). However, the bottler received territorial	63.600006103515625	464.0840148925781	10.800018310546875	468.4688415527344	200

We argue that there are two important competitive factors associated with the creation of the	63.600006103515625	526.7239990234375	10.800018310546875	467.9962463378906	202
SEM that will impact the organizational structure of the CSD segment as described above. First	63.600006103515625	555.0440673828125	10.800018310546875	467.7372741699219	203
comes the impact on production and distribution. On the one hand, although NTBs have been	63.600006103515625	583.364013671875	10.800018310546875	468.2448425292969	204
eliminated, it could be the case that due to territorial exclusivity constraints, the EU CSD market	63.600006103515625	611.68408203125	10.800003051757812	467.7278137207031	205
will remain geographically segmented in production. If the EU market becomes the relevant	63.600006103515625	640.0040893554688	10.800003051757812	467.7442321777344	206

less traded, due to transport costs. Also, economies of scale in bottling have increased over time	63.5999755859375	128.56402587890625	10.79998779296875	467.9171142578125	211
due to better transportation systems, and the reduction in the use of returnable bottles (Muris et	63.5999755859375	156.884033203125	10.79998779296875	467.73486328125	212
al, 1992).15 This means that fewer bottlers are required to supply the market.	63.5999755859375	182.77447509765625	13.22955322265625	364.8961181640625	213
Muris et al (1992) argue that in the US, changes in the external environment increased the	63.599998474121094	219.5240478515625	10.79998779296875	467.91605377197266	214
transaction costs between the concentrate manufacturers and their bottlers.16 Also, the new	63.599998474121094	245.4144287109375	13.2296142578125	468.0239028930664	215
competitive environment required new product and marketing strategies, whose implementation	63.60003662109375	276.16400146484375	10.79998779296875	468.2540283203125	216
required the close cooperation of the distribution system. In turn, this favored vertical integration	63.60003662109375	304.4840087890625	10.79998779296875	468.2275390625	217
over contracting.17 These arguments can equally be applied to the creation of the single market in	63.60003662109375	330.3744812011719	13.229522705078125	468.1968994140625	218
the EU, leading to vertical integration being the preferred corporate strategy. National and indeed,	63.600006103515625	361.1239929199219	10.800018310546875	467.8881530761719	219
European supermarket chains are growing, making coordination between the firm and a network	63.600006103515625	389.4440002441406	10.800018310546875	468.0176696777344	220
of bottlers more difficult, and so, expensive. Also, in recent years, the rate of new product	63.600006103515625	417.7640075683594	10.800018310546875	467.6459045410156	221
introductions has increased. It is easier if the CSD manufacturer owns the bottler to introduce the	63.600006103515625	446.0840148925781	10.800018310546875	467.9797058105469	222
new product than convince an independent to make the necessary firm-specific investment, as	63.600006103515625	474.4040222167969	10.800018310546875	468.0716857910156	223
most new introductions fail. This yields Hypothesis 3.	63.600006103515625	502.7240295410156	10.800018310546875	255.25799560546875	224
Hypothesis 3: increased competitive pressures will be positively associated with increased	63.600006103515625	543.0440673828125	10.800018310546875	467.9471740722656	225

15 In the US, for example, the number of soft drink bottling plants has persistently decreased in 1950, there were	63.599998474121094	625.84619140625	11.053146362304688	468.1753921508789	227
more than 6000 plants; this had declined to 3100 by 1970 (Katz, 1978), and 800 by 1990 (Muris et al, 1992).	63.59966278076172	639.8275756835938	9.072006225585938	441.94766998291016	227
16 Historically, the value of CSDs relative to transport costs was low, and the use of returnable (and breakable)	63.599998474121094	649.84619140625	11.053146362304688	467.9970474243164	227
containers required local manufacturing and a substantial local delivery system. Thus, despite substantial asset	63.59966278076172	663.8275756835938	9.072006225585938	467.9649124145508	227
specificity, it was not possible to effectively organize hundreds of manufacturing and distribution operations, given	63.59966278076172	675.8278198242188	9.072006225585938	467.7783889770508	227

17 The one vital difference between Coca-Cola’s and Pepsi’s distribution system is that Pepsi’s franchise agreement	63.599998474121094	697.84619140625	11.053146362304688	467.92130279541016	227
gave its bottlers exclusive perpetual rights to fountain sales (both had perpetual exclusive territories). This limited	63.59966278076172	711.8275756835938	9.072006225585938	467.98719024658203	227
Pepsi’s ability to negotiate such sales nationally and thus, their ability to compete effectively in the US fountain	63.59966278076172	723.8278198242188	9.072006225585938	467.7825393676758	227

Mineral water producers are required by law to bottle at source (1984 EU directive), and are	63.5999755859375	128.56402587890625	10.79998779296875	468.00360107421875	230
therefore capacity constrained as compared to CSD firms in the sense that there is a finite supply	63.5999755859375	156.884033203125	10.79998779296875	468.41766357421875	231
of water from each source. As with CSD producers, supply is typically characterized by a large	63.5999755859375	185.20404052734375	10.79998779296875	468.02642822265625	232

system as observed in the CSD segment cannot be used in the mineral water segment due to the	63.600006103515625	241.843994140625	10.79998779296875	468.0395202636719	234
legal requirement to bottle at source. This means that mineral water producers are forced to	63.600006103515625	270.16400146484375	10.79998779296875	467.6709289550781	235
export. Given the high transportation costs, this is likely to place a limit on the final market size.	63.600006103515625	298.4840087890625	10.79998779296875	467.8869934082031	236

In this section, evidence is presented in support of Hypotheses 1-3. Hypothesis 1 states that in a	63.600006103515625	423.76397705078125	10.800018310546875	468.0503234863281	241
Type 2 industry, an increase in market size tends to be associated with an increase in advertising	63.600006103515625	452.083984375	10.800018310546875	467.9497985839844	242
expenditure and so, concentration. Hypothesis 2 states that the impact of the SEM will be to	63.600006103515625	480.40399169921875	10.800018310546875	467.7614440917969	243
increase the degree of multinationality at the firm level. This may have little impact on national	63.600006103515625	508.7240295410156	10.800018310546875	468.4211120605469	244
concentration as domestic incumbents are acquired but will have a significant effect on	63.600006103515625	537.0439453125	10.800018310546875	468.1847229003906	245

Source: Euromonitor (1993). Figures were converted into ECUm at the annual average exchange rate, taken from	63.599998474121094	591.8273315429688	9.072006225585938	467.91165924072266	273

Table 4 shows that, consistent with Hypothesis 1, where market size is larger in a particular	63.599998474121094	634.2440185546875	10.800003051757812	467.9338150024414	274
segment, advertising expenditure is also larger. Thus, the mineral water segment dominates	63.599998474121094	662.5640258789062	10.800003051757812	468.1486587524414	275

mineral water segment than in cola. The real average annual growth rate for mineral water	63.5999755859375	100.2440185546875	10.79998779296875	467.93414306640625	279
between 1986 and 1989 was 63%, compared with 17% for cola. This is suggestive of a response	63.5999755859375	128.56402587890625	10.79998779296875	467.9771728515625	280
to the boom in demand for mineral water over the late 1980s.	63.5999755859375	156.884033203125	10.79998779296875	292.15435791015625	281
The mineral water segment is particularly interesting as it may highlight a possible limitation of the	63.5999755859375	191.20404052734375	10.79998779296875	468.0528564453125	282
theoretical framework. Sutton (1991) showed that in France, the escalation of advertising outlays	63.5999755859375	219.5240478515625	10.79998779296875	468.026611328125	283
by Perrier was very effective in increasing market share, and subsequently, other currently leading	63.5999755859375	247.84405517578125	10.79998779296875	467.95208740234375	284
brands were also heavily advertised. By contrast, nothing similar had occurred in the other major	63.5999755859375	276.1640625	10.79998779296875	467.92535400390625	285
European markets by 1986. Germany remained fragmented, and Italy lay in between in terms of	63.5999755859375	304.48406982421875	10.79998779296875	468.3372802734375	286
concentration although firms were advertising intensively in both countries, and market conditions	63.5999755859375	332.8040466308594	10.800018310546875	468.0673828125	287
were similar in terms of market size and consumer demand. Sutton argued that mineral water is an	63.5999755859375	361.1240539550781	10.800018310546875	468.24017333984375	288
outlier. However, if cross-country structural differences do reflect variation in the effectiveness of	63.5999755859375	389.4440612792969	10.800018310546875	468.448486328125	289
advertising to stimulate willingness to pay, then the theoretical framework is flawed. In other	63.5999755859375	417.7640686035156	10.800018310546875	467.903564453125	290
words, the usefulness of the theory is crucially dependent on the assumption that the advertising	63.5999755859375	446.0840759277344	10.800018310546875	467.966552734375	291
response function depends only on certain product characteristics which may be impossible to	63.5999755859375	474.4040832519531	10.800018310546875	467.85491943359375	292
proxy but determine the effectiveness of advertising in increasing demand.20 What the theoretical	63.5999755859375	500.29449462890625	13.2296142578125	468.457275390625	293
framework is not consistent with is the notion that the advertising response function depends on	63.600006103515625	531.0439453125	10.800018310546875	468.2434387207031	294
idiosyncratic features of a firm’s advertising campaign. This is because at the heart of the	63.600006103515625	559.364013671875	10.800018310546875	468.0479431152344	295
empirical methodology lies the ability to categorize industries into those in which advertising can	63.600006103515625	587.6840209960938	10.800003051757812	468.2306213378906	296
increase perceived quality and those in which it cannot. If variation in concentration across the EU	63.600006103515625	616.0040893554688	10.800003051757812	468.0444030761719	297
20 The advertising response function may also depend on observable institutional factors that differ across	63.599998474121094	697.84619140625	11.053146362304688	468.0865249633789	298

advertising has never come close to US levels (Quelch and Harding, 1996). Also, there may exist cultural	63.59966278076172	723.8278198242188	9.072006225585938	467.9268264770508	298

Consider Hypothesis 2 relating to an increase in the degree of multinationality and its consequent	63.599998474121094	162.884033203125	10.79998779296875	467.7601089477539	302
impact on concentration. Within the CSD segment, we observe reorganization of firm structure	63.599998474121094	191.20404052734375	10.79998779296875	468.07315826416016	303
(see below); within the mineral water sector, due to the legal requirement of bottling at source,	63.599998474121094	219.5240478515625	10.79998779296875	467.87284088134766	304
and a limit on capacity, we should observe an increase in multinationality. We look first at the	63.599998474121094	247.84405517578125	10.79998779296875	468.0134048461914	305
most important cross-border merger and acquisition activity that has taken place since 1987.	63.599998474121094	276.1640625	10.79998779296875	467.8512954711914	306
Secondly, the corresponding impact on concentration is discussed.	63.599998474121094	304.48406982421875	10.79998779296875	316.0607376098633	307
The most important acquisition was that of Perrier by Nestlé in 1992, and the subsequent sale of	63.599998474121094	338.8040466308594	10.800018310546875	468.36710357666016	308
Volvic to the French firm, Danone (the firm was then called BSN) - the sale of Volvic was	63.599998474121094	367.1240539550781	10.800018310546875	468.0673599243164	309
stipulated by the European Commission, along with certain other conditions. This acquisition	63.599998474121094	395.4440612792969	10.800018310546875	468.1846694946289	310
fundamentally altered the EU mineral water segment. In 1987, the combined market share of the	63.599998474121094	423.7640686035156	10.800018310546875	467.9795913696289	311
top three firms was about 60%.22 Pre-merger, Perrier had considerable free capacity in the	63.599998474121094	449.65447998046875	13.2296142578125	468.03617095947266	312
majority of its sources, Nestlé was operating close to capacity in all its sources and in the case of	63.59999084472656	480.40399169921875	10.800018310546875	468.38877868652344	313
Danone, its still water brand, Evian, was not operating to maximum capacity, but its sparkling	63.59999084472656	508.7240295410156	10.800018310546875	468.0001678466797	314
water brand, Badoit, was. The sale of Volvic to Danone, with Nestlé retaining the Perrier sources,	63.59999084472656	537.0439453125	10.800018310546875	467.8802947998047	315
gave both firms considerable extra capacity and more brands.23 Also, through the acquisition of	63.59999084472656	562.9345092773438	13.229522705078125	468.40562438964844	316
Perrier, Nestlé now controls major springs in a number of EU member states (e.g., Buxton in the	63.600006103515625	593.6840209960938	10.800003051757812	468.0481262207031	317
21 Differences in concentration could arise from observing disequilibrium market structure in certain countries. If	63.599998474121094	633.76611328125	11.053207397460938	468.21976470947266	318
this is true, German market structure may, over time, come to approximate the market structure observed in	63.59966278076172	647.74755859375	9.072006225585938	467.7874221801758	318

22 As the demand for mineral water has increased, new springs have been opened, mainly by small firms	63.599998474121094	669.76611328125	11.053207397460938	468.07852935791016	318
competing in price only. These local firms do not have a large enough market, due to the limitations imposed by	63.59966278076172	683.74755859375	9.072006225585938	468.3944778442383	318

23 Interestingly, Danone’s leading brands (Evian and Volvic) are both waters of low mineral content (< 500 mg per	63.599998474121094	705.76611328125	11.053207397460938	467.75296783447266	318
liter) whereas Nestlé’s leading brands (Contrex, Vittel and Hépar) are waters of high mineral content (> 500 mg	63.59966278076172	719.74755859375	9.072006225585938	468.03772735595703	318

UK). Therefore, any future EU-wide increase in demand could then be fulfilled by these two	63.5999755859375	100.2440185546875	10.79998779296875	467.748046875	320
firms. Post-merger, the 1993 combined market share of Nestlé and Danone was about 82% in	63.5999755859375	128.56402587890625	10.79998779296875	468.20172119140625	321
France, and approximately 35% of the overall EU mineral water market (Panorama, 1994).24	63.5999755859375	154.4544677734375	13.22955322265625	440.99981689453125	322
Focusing on other important EU markets in terms of size,25 in both Italy and Germany, the leading	63.599998474121094	188.77447509765625	13.22955322265625	467.98917388916016	323
brands are typically bottled in glass, substantially increasing the importance of transport costs. As	63.600006103515625	219.5240478515625	10.79998779296875	468.1440124511719	324
there exist few national retailers, this hinders the nationalization of the market due to	63.600006103515625	247.84405517578125	10.79998779296875	467.7190246582031	325
distributional problems. In Germany, 1993 mineral water consumption was higher than in France,	63.600006103515625	276.1640625	10.79998779296875	467.8558654785156	326
but the industry remains fragmented: the top four firms controlled approximately 25% of the	63.600006103515625	304.48406982421875	10.79998779296875	468.0597839355469	327
market. The leading firms are subsidiaries of major food and drink manufacturers (e.g. Apollinaris	63.600006103515625	332.8040466308594	10.800018310546875	468.0505676269531	328
is owned by a leading brewer, Brau und Brunnen; Blaue Quellen is owned by Nestlé). Although	63.600006103515625	361.1240539550781	10.800018310546875	468.2002258300781	329
the mineral water market segment is advertising intensive, there is comparatively little TV	63.600006103515625	389.4440612792969	10.800018310546875	468.0420837402344	330
advertising in contrast to CSDs. However, Euromonitor (1993) asserts that demand for premium	63.600006103515625	417.7640686035156	10.800018310546875	468.4549255371094	331
brands has risen in recent years, primarily due to their sophisticated yet healthy image.	63.600006103515625	446.0840759277344	10.800018310546875	467.8118591308594	332
Notwithstanding this, the production of mineral water remains dominated by relatively small	63.600006103515625	474.4040832519531	10.800018310546875	468.4654846191406	333
enterprises; only a few brands go beyond regional or even local boundaries. In Italy, since 1986,	63.600006103515625	502.7240905761719	10.800018310546875	467.8381042480469	334
as market size has increased, advertising has also increased, and the market has become more	63.600006103515625	531.0440673828125	10.800018310546875	467.9808044433594	335

per liter). As a result of the merger, Danone and Nestlé have also succeeded in further segmenting the French	63.599998474121094	602.8673095703125	9.072006225585938	467.7614517211914	337
market horizontally (in terms of the product characteristics), as well as by perceived quality.	63.600006103515625	614.8675537109375	9.072006225585938	373.2088317871094	337
24 Since 1987, Danone has expanded substantially in Spain and Italy; and Nestlé in Germany and Italy (acquiring	63.599998474121094	624.8861083984375	11.053207397460938	468.00321197509766	337

25 In the UK, Perrier was the leading brand in 1987, with the highest advertising and a 60% market share. Market	63.599998474121094	648.8861083984375	11.053207397460938	467.9123306274414	337
size has been rapidly increasing, although from a very small base. As mineral water production is low-tech, new	63.59966278076172	662.8675537109375	9.072006225585938	468.35095977783203	337
firms can enter relatively easily which has contributed to the strong own-label growth (accounting for 42% of 1993	63.59966278076172	674.8677978515625	9.072006225585938	468.0014114379883	337
sales in the grocery sector). In 1993, advertising was as follows: Evian=£0.7m; Highland Spring=Volvic=£0.69m;	63.59966278076172	686.8680419921875	9.072006225585938	467.9216995239258	337
Perrier=£0.44m. As the theoretical framework predicts, such expenditures are reflected in the firms’ market	63.59967041015625	699.34814453125	9.072006225585938	467.92083740234375	337
shares. It is estimated that Evian is now the market leader in terms of volume, with a market share of 11.2%, then	63.598670959472656	711.8281860351562	9.071998596191406	467.7854232788086	337
Buxton with 6.5%, Volvic with 6.1%, and Highland Spring with 5.8% (Key Note, 1994). Perrier now has only a	63.598670959472656	723.828369140625	9.072006225585938	467.91158294677734	337

and an increase in concentration at the EU level.	63.5999755859375	128.56402587890625	10.79998779296875	229.82876586914062	387
Hypothesis 3 linked increasing competitive pressure and reorganization of the franchise network	63.5999755859375	162.884033203125	10.79998779296875	468.118896484375	388
in order to better exploit the wider market and expand internationally. We argued that leading	63.5999755859375	191.20404052734375	10.79998779296875	467.948486328125	389
firms were more likely to vertically integrate to exploit the new market opportunities. This is	63.5999755859375	219.5240478515625	10.79998779296875	468.09625244140625	390
observed in the data, particularly in the case of Coca-Cola, giving the firm direct control over the	63.5999755859375	247.84405517578125	10.79998779296875	468.0491943359375	391
distribution and marketing of the product.	63.5999755859375	276.1640625	10.79998779296875	199.320068359375	392
In France, for example, Pernod-Ricard used to hold the Coca-Cola franchise. Coca-Cola was	63.5999755859375	310.48406982421875	10.79998779296875	468.0626220703125	393
dissatisfied with sales because: i) CSD market size was very small compared with other EU	63.5999755859375	338.8040466308594	10.800018310546875	468.00482177734375	394
markets; ii) Coca-Cola was not the market leader. Coca-Cola’s main objectives in taking over	63.5999755859375	367.1240539550781	10.800018310546875	467.8499755859375	395
bottling were to improve its distribution system and customer relationships, and sales have	63.5999755859375	395.4440612792969	10.800018310546875	468.04791259765625	396
dramatically increased since. The 1993 company report shows that over the past 5 years, the	63.5999755859375	423.7640686035156	10.800018310546875	468.019287109375	397
average annual growth rate (volume) was 15%, compared with an industry average of 9%.	63.5999755859375	452.0840759277344	10.800018310546875	431.11187744140625	398
In Germany, a wholly-owned subsidiary manages a national network of local bottlers. In 1983,	63.5999755859375	486.4040832519531	10.800018310546875	467.8321533203125	399
there were more than 100 bottlers franchised; by 1989, this number was 61.27 This indicates, as	63.5999755859375	512.2944946289062	13.229644775390625	468.1417236328125	400
also observed in the US market, the movement towards consolidation as the market became more	63.600006103515625	543.0439453125	10.800018310546875	468.0263366699219	401
mature. Coca-Cola dominates the German market with a 1996 volume market share of 56%,	63.600006103515625	571.364013671875	10.800018310546875	467.8233337402344	402
compared to Pepsi’s 5% and is also the largest advertiser, mainly via television (Euromonitor,	63.600006103515625	599.6840209960938	10.800003051757812	467.8681335449219	403
1993). Coca-Cola also dominates the Italian market (48% volume market share in 1996)	63.600006103515625	628.0040893554688	10.800003051757812	467.8368225097656	404
27 Traditionally, most bottling plants were under the control of the brewers, of whom there are hundreds as they	63.599998474121094	709.84619140625	11.053138732910156	468.4878921508789	405
were protected by the German beer purity laws. However, following the EU decision that the beer purity law is	63.59966278076172	723.8275756835938	9.072006225585938	468.08094024658203	405
illegal, substantial restructuring is expected as German firms will now face increased competition.	63.59966278076172	735.8278198242188	9.072006225585938	397.9251480102539	405

compared to PepsiCo’s 13%, which has been slowly increasing since 1988 when San Benedetto,	63.5999755859375	100.2440185546875	10.79998779296875	467.83209228515625	407
an established mineral water producer, began to bottle Pepsi and 7-Up.	63.5999755859375	128.56402587890625	10.79998779296875	337.5863952636719	408
UK market structure was radically altered in 1986 when two new ventures were formed: i) a JV	63.5999755859375	162.884033203125	10.79998779296875	468.04791259765625	409
between Coca-Cola and Schweppes Beverages (hereafter, CCSB); ii) a merger between the soft	63.5999755859375	191.20404052734375	10.79998779296875	467.6158447265625	410
drinks businesses of Britvic and Britannia Soft Drinks, forming Britvic.28 The main incentive was	63.5999755859375	217.094482421875	13.22955322265625	468.10333251953125	411
that the market was becoming national rather than regional (equivalent to an increase in effective	63.5999755859375	247.843994140625	10.79998779296875	468.0716552734375	412
market size), and retail chains and other buyers wanted to do business with one national rather	63.5999755859375	276.16400146484375	10.79998779296875	467.916015625	413
than many regional suppliers.29 Also, using several bottlers meant that marketing incentives were	63.5999755859375	302.054443359375	13.22955322265625	468.05035400390625	414
lessened as advertising efforts would, in part, be appropriated by other firms.	63.600006103515625	332.8039855957031	10.800018310546875	365.4338073730469	415
A 1991 Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) inquiry found that CCSB had a 42.7%	63.600006103515625	367.1239929199219	10.800018310546875	467.9170837402344	416
share by market value and Britvic a 22.4% market share. Since 1987, Britvic had increased their	63.600006103515625	395.4440002441406	10.800018310546875	467.8632507324219	417
market share from 19.5%, but at the expense of smaller firms, rather than CCSB.30 It was	63.600006103515625	421.33447265625	13.22955322265625	468.1080017089844	418
estimated that the number of firms operating in the UK was 100, compared with the 1986	63.600006103515625	452.083984375	10.800018310546875	467.9281311035156	419
estimate of 270 firms (Sutton, 1991). By 1993, the number of firms operating in the UK was	63.600006103515625	480.40399169921875	10.800018310546875	468.0166931152344	420
28 At this point in time, CCSB controlled the Coca-Cola, Fanta and Lilt brands, and also Schweppes, Russchian,	63.599998474121094	528.8861083984375	11.053192138671875	467.8777847290039	421
etc., giving them a presence in most market niches; since 1990, they have considerably expanded abroad, acquiring	63.59966278076172	542.8675537109375	9.071990966796875	468.00257110595703	421
Perrier’s non-water interests to give a strong position in Spain and France. Britvic is the only other UK firm to	63.59966278076172	554.8677978515625	9.071990966796875	468.2268753051758	421
produce a full range, including Pepsi and 7-Up, with a far stronger position in the licensed trade due to connections	63.59966278076172	566.8680419921875	9.071990966796875	468.2311477661133	421
with leading brewers.	63.59966278076172	578.8683471679688	9.072006225585938	87.26360321044922	421
29 In the UK, the top 5 supermarkets account for 62% of sales, versus 21% in the US; 54% of Sainsbury’s sales	63.599998474121094	588.8861083984375	11.053207397460938	468.0785903930664	421
come from own-brand labels (Quelch and Harding, 1996). When Sainsbury’s Classic was first introduced in 1994,	63.59966278076172	602.8675537109375	9.072006225585938	467.8743362426758	421
2 liters cost 59 pence versus 105 pence for Coke; Coca-Cola’s market share initially slumped from 63% to 33% in	63.59966278076172	614.8677978515625	9.072006225585938	467.72718048095703	421
Sainsbury supermarkets. In 1995, own-label cola took 65% of total cola sales in Sainsbury and 15% of the total UK	63.59966278076172	626.8680419921875	9.072006225585938	468.08618927001953	421

30 In 1993, Britvic/PepsiCo launched a new brand, Pepsi Max, a diet cola with a trendy appeal, spending £3.5m on	63.599998474121094	648.8861083984375	11.053207397460938	467.75907135009766	421
advertising. This was the first time PepsiCo had launched a new product in any other market apart from the US,	63.599700927734375	663.347412109375	9.072006225585938	467.8702087402344	421
first introducing it in Scotland. By contrast, CCSB spent only £1.2m on its diet brand, Diet Coca-Cola. Thus, an	63.599700927734375	675.34765625	9.072006225585938	467.7603454589844	421
absolutely higher amount was spent by Britvic/PepsiCo and Pepsi Max immediately took a 10% market share, and	63.598663330078125	687.82763671875	9.072006225585938	467.9922180175781	421
accounted for 20% of Pepsi’s UK sales by the end of 1995. The observed successful strategy is not to compete with	63.598663330078125	699.827880859375	9.072006225585938	467.7583312988281	421
Coca-Cola on exactly the same product, but instead to innovate, to develop new market niches. Britvic also	63.598663330078125	711.828125	9.072006225585938	468.2341003417969	421
introduced a new innovative and award winning advertising campaign for its Tango brand, highlighting its tangy	63.598663330078125	723.828369140625	9.072006225585938	468.4648742675781	421
orange flavor. The packaging was also redesigned, and the brand increased its market share.	63.598663330078125	735.82861328125	9.072006225585938	374.5224609375	421

further reduced to 70 (Panorama, 1995). The evidence on the number of firms is consistent with	63.5999755859375	100.2440185546875	10.79998779296875	468.142333984375	423
the Sutton hypothesis that the less efficient firms or the large fringe of small firms can no longer	63.5999755859375	128.56402587890625	10.79998779296875	467.88970947265625	424
compete as advertising expenditure escalates. The firms escalating their expenditure will break	63.5999755859375	156.884033203125	10.79998779296875	467.97967529296875	425
free from the rest of the pack, and either merger and/or exit takes place. In 1996, Coca-Cola	63.5999755859375	185.20404052734375	10.79998779296875	467.9398193359375	426
bought out the franchise agreement, ending the 10 year old UK joint venture, and consistent with	63.5999755859375	213.5240478515625	10.79998779296875	468.2281494140625	427
Hypothesis 2, this shows further evidence of forward vertical integration.	63.5999755859375	241.84405517578125	10.79998779296875	347.9254455566406	428
In 1997, Coca-Cola created a new ‘anchor bottler’ in the Nordic countries called Coca-Cola	63.5999755859375	276.1640625	10.79998779296875	468.0223388671875	429
Nordic Beverages to serve Denmark, Sweden and Norway. This was a joint venture between	63.5999755859375	304.48406982421875	10.79998779296875	468.25408935546875	430
Coca-Cola (49%) and Carlsberg A/S (51%). In 1998, the largest Coca-Cola bottler outside North	63.5999755859375	332.8040466308594	10.800018310546875	468.22314453125	431

Overall, the evidence is consistent with Hypothesis 3.	63.599998474121094	446.083984375	10.800018310546875	253.85395050048828	435

The main objective of this industry case was to assess the effect of European integration on the	63.599998474121094	514.7239990234375	10.800018310546875	468.04312896728516	438
competitive process in the soft drinks industry, applying the new theory of industrial structure as	63.599998474121094	543.0439453125	10.800018310546875	468.09622955322266	439
developed most fully in Sutton (1991). Our results showed first that as market size increased, so	63.599998474121094	571.364013671875	10.800018310546875	467.68192291259766	440
too did advertising expenditure, although not faster than market size. Secondly, an increase in	63.599998474121094	599.6840209960938	10.800003051757812	468.2375259399414	441
concentration was observed at the EU level, and no systematic pattern was observed at the	63.599998474121094	628.0040283203125	10.800003051757812	467.95902252197266	442

in the US (44% owned by Coca-Cola in 1997). Pepsi bottling operations accounted for 52% of Pepsi’s soft drink	63.59966278076172	723.8275756835938	9.072006225585938	468.0930862426758	444

major segments within the soft drinks industry in the way that firms responded. Undertaking such	63.5999755859375	100.2440185546875	10.79998779296875	468.242431640625	446
a case study allowed us to assess how different structural features impacted the way that firms	63.5999755859375	128.56402587890625	10.79998779296875	468.19195556640625	446
respond to the underlying Type 2 industry nature.	63.5999755859375	156.884033203125	10.79998779296875	236.052001953125	446
Within the mineral water segment, firms are capacity constrained by the legal requirement of	63.5999755859375	191.20404052734375	10.79998779296875	468.38519287109375	447
bottling at source. Market size has been increasing over the past decade across all member states	63.5999755859375	219.5240478515625	10.79998779296875	468.07196044921875	447
(starting from a very low base in the UK). Both the French and Italian market structures have	63.5999755859375	247.84405517578125	10.79998779296875	468.1202392578125	447
been characterized by increasing consolidation, and the extent of MNE activity has also rapidly	63.5999755859375	276.1640625	10.79998779296875	468.5281982421875	447
increased. It was argued (Sutton, 1991) that the French market was relatively stable. We believe	63.5999755859375	304.48406982421875	10.79998779296875	467.95880126953125	447
that one of the major reasons the Nestlé-Perrier merger took place was in order to exploit the	63.5999755859375	332.8040466308594	10.800018310546875	468.005859375	447
Perrier brand name across the entire EU. In general, it is difficult for advertising campaigns to be	63.5999755859375	361.1240539550781	10.800018310546875	468.03369140625	447
transferable across borders, if only because of language difficulties, but it may be easier to transfer	63.5999755859375	389.4440612792969	10.800018310546875	467.8104248046875	447
management expertise. Thus, the EU may become unified through integration of corporate	63.5999755859375	417.7640686035156	10.800018310546875	468.0120849609375	447
strategy. As observed in the data, MNEs such as Nestlé and Danone are acquiring mineral water	63.5999755859375	446.0840759277344	10.800018310546875	467.92333984375	447
springs in various member states; distribution is limited only by the degree of transport costs.	63.5999755859375	474.4040832519531	10.800018310546875	441.7319641113281	447
Within the CSD segment, we then investigated the extent of a first-mover advantage. We showed	63.5999755859375	508.7240905761719	10.800018310546875	467.94976806640625	448
that market size increased, raising the incentive for PepsiCo and other CSD firms to escalate their	63.5999755859375	537.0440673828125	10.800018310546875	467.93157958984375	448
advertising expenditure. If other soft drink firms such as PepsiCo do begin to heavily advertise	63.5999755859375	565.3641357421875	10.800018310546875	468.05169677734375	448
their products as market size increases, but Coca-Cola does not lose market share, then we can	63.5999755859375	593.6841430664062	10.800003051757812	468.26373291015625	448
conclude that the first-mover advantage must be stronger than the market size effect. On the other	63.5999755859375	622.004150390625	10.800003051757812	467.7900390625	448
hand, if we were to observe an erosion in Coca-Cola’s market share, this would suggest that other	63.5999755859375	650.3241577148438	10.800003051757812	467.89202880859375	448
firms are successfully convincing consumers that the (perceived) quality of their products is higher	63.5999755859375	678.6441650390625	10.800003051757812	467.88604736328125	448
than Coca-Cola. In all member states, Coca-Cola has not been losing market share. Only in the	63.5999755859375	706.9641723632812	10.800003051757812	468.0357666015625	448

UK market is PepsiCo succeeding in persuading consumers to buy their product, with the	63.5999755859375	100.2440185546875	10.79998779296875	468.0728759765625	450
introduction and subsequent intensive advertising of their innovative product, Pepsi Max.	63.5999755859375	128.56402587890625	10.79998779296875	467.86212158203125	450
Interestingly, this implies that the first-mover advantage is stronger than the market size effect.	63.5999755859375	156.884033203125	10.79998779296875	450.0399169921875	450
In conclusion, we have shown that the soft drinks industry is currently in transition, becoming	63.5999755859375	191.20404052734375	10.79998779296875	468.01409912109375	451
increasingly dominated by MNEs who make decisions based on overall opportunities within the	63.5999755859375	219.5240478515625	10.79998779296875	468.0467529296875	451
European market. Thus, this case study suggests that trade integration is not the only route to	63.5999755859375	247.84405517578125	10.79998779296875	467.72125244140625	451
market integration. Integration of corporate strategy through multinationality is an additional way.	63.5999755859375	276.1640625	10.79998779296875	467.40142822265625	451
