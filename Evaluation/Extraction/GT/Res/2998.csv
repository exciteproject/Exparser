Abstract: This paper is based on the analysis of an autobio-	165.5399932861328	228.2030029296875	9.5115966796875	229.83021545410156	3
graphical narrative interview with a Turkish woman living	165.5399932861328	239.6949462890625	9.48004150390625	229.93162536621094	3

enced by the narrator’s migration experiences. It has at least	165.5399932861328	262.735107421875	9.48004150390625	229.86338806152344	3
two aspects. One aspect refers to the cultural roots of the	165.5399932861328	274.19549560546875	9.48004150390625	229.91175842285156	3
narrator. New experiences have changed her self-image of	165.5399932861328	285.715576171875	9.48004150390625	229.8785858154297	3
being a woman. A second aspect is connected with the nar-	165.5399932861328	297.23565673828125	9.48004150390625	229.87962341308594	3
rator’s life course. The narrative shows how a naive girl has	165.5399932861328	308.696044921875	9.48004150390625	229.9269256591797	3
become an adult and independent woman. Being a woman	165.5399932861328	320.21612548828125	9.48004150390625	229.8927459716797	3
is defined with the help of categories belonging to Western	165.5399932861328	331.7362365722656	9.47998046875	229.9213104248047	3
culture. Therefore, the process of migration is related to los-	165.5399932861328	343.19659423828125	9.47998046875	229.7628936767578	3
ing culturally influenced ways of describing the narrator’s	165.53997802734375	354.7166748046875	9.47998046875	229.90325927734375	3
identity. As a result, she becomes a stranger in her home-	165.53997802734375	366.23675537109375	9.47998046875	229.87762451171875	3
land, but she also remains a stranger in the country to which	165.53997802734375	377.6971130371094	9.47998046875	229.92025756835938	3
she migrated. I analyze the narrator’s work on this problem.	165.53997802734375	389.2171936035156	9.47998046875	227.77590942382812	3

processes that an individual can be involved in when migrating. This life story	128.6999969482422	486.17510986328125	9.47998046875	303.60829162597656	5

revolutions—to the peaceful penetration of migrating individuals. Thus, in	128.69961547851562	115.31494140625	9.48004150390625	303.7401123046875	8
modern societies migration does not have to be the consequence of rapid or	128.69961547851562	126.83502197265625	9.48004150390625	303.52117919921875	8

placed by the other. Nevertheless, the process always affects an immigrant-	128.69961547851562	149.81549072265625	9.48004150390625	303.52874755859375	8

which the migration takes place. In each case it is interpreted differently. Emi-	128.69961547851562	172.79595947265625	9.48004150390625	303.628173828125	8

ments; whereas the immigrant receiving society must solve problems related to	128.69961547851562	195.83612060546875	9.48004150390625	303.564697265625	8
new-comers, taking into account not only their economic needs but also social	128.69961547851562	207.2965087890625	9.48004150390625	303.5761413574219	8
and cultural differences, which may or may not be accepted.	128.69961547851562	218.81658935546875	9.48004150390625	229.24722290039062	8
In my country migration is still a new phenomenon if we consider Poland as	140.0395965576172	230.336669921875	9.48004150390625	292.29588317871094	8
an immigrant-receiving society. In comparison with Western European coun-	128.69961547851562	241.79705810546875	9.48004150390625	303.6083068847656	8
tries it is a marginal phenomenon, although the situation has been gradually	128.69961547851562	253.317138671875	9.48004150390625	303.6026916503906	8
changing since 1989. On the other hand, the people of my nation are very ex-	128.69961547851562	264.83721923828125	9.48004150390625	303.6869812011719	8
perienced in migrating. For example, since the beginning of the 19th century	128.69961547851562	276.297607421875	9.48004150390625	303.5665588378906	8
we have had numerous huge waves of emigration due to political and economic	128.69961547851562	287.81768798828125	9.48004150390625	303.5912170410156	8
reasons. The last remarkable wave took place in the early 1980s when commu-	128.69961547851562	299.3377685546875	9.48004150390625	303.6282958984375	8
nist authorities established marshal law to suppress the Solidarity movement.	128.69961547851562	310.79815673828125	9.48004150390625	292.8305969238281	8
No doubt, migration gained its specific symbolic meaning in the Polish tra-	140.0395965576172	322.3182373046875	9.480010986328125	292.2246551513672	8
dition because of its political aspect: again and again many outstanding persons	128.69961547851562	333.8383483886719	9.47998046875	303.63775634765625	8
had to leave the country. In such cases, mourning the lost homeland was their	128.69961547851562	345.2987060546875	9.47998046875	303.64703369140625	8
main experience. This sorrow has been emphatically expressed in Polish litera-	128.69961547851562	356.81878662109375	9.47998046875	303.6766357421875	8
ture and poetry. It is enough to mention that the Polish Romantic artistic output	128.69961547851562	368.3388671875	9.47998046875	303.6044921875	8
was created abroad by the artists for whom longing for the country they left	128.69961547851562	379.7992248535156	9.47998046875	303.66619873046875	8
behind was the major theme of many of their masterpieces.	128.69961547851562	391.3193054199219	9.47998046875	224.78878784179688	8
Political reasons for Polish migration were sometimes “overused” by those	140.0395965576172	402.8393859863281	9.47998046875	292.22853088378906	8
who aimed to leave the country because for economic reasons, especially dur-	128.69961547851562	414.29974365234375	9.47998046875	303.70794677734375	8
ing the decade of the 1980s. During that time many people left the country	128.69961547851562	425.81982421875	9.47998046875	303.6064758300781	8
asking for political asylum, when economic needs were the real motives behind	128.69961547851562	437.33990478515625	9.47998046875	303.63397216796875	8
their decision to leave. This aspect of migration is still important and it has	128.69961547851562	448.8002624511719	9.47998046875	303.67095947265625	8
always been more significant to the majority of those Poles who decided to	128.69961547851562	460.3203430175781	9.47998046875	303.6225280761719	8
migrate. In order to improve their fate Poles were leaving for richer European	128.69961547851562	471.8404235839844	9.47998046875	303.6036071777344	8
countries, South America (e.g. Brazil), and above all, the United States. The	128.69961547851562	483.30078125	9.47998046875	303.6529235839844	8
United States has always been identified in the Polish tradition as the country	128.69961547851562	494.82086181640625	9.47998046875	303.55621337890625	8
of freedom and welfare. This economic immigration has been called “za chle-	128.69961547851562	506.3409423828125	9.47998046875	303.5542907714844	8
bem” which can be translated as “looking for bread,” and is treated in Poland	128.69961547851562	517.80126953125	9.47998046875	303.6614685058594	8
as a symbol of fulfilling basic human needs. From this perspective, migration	128.69961547851562	529.3214111328125	9.47998046875	303.5750732421875	8
remains an important process in the social history of Poland. These types of	128.69961547851562	540.8414306640625	9.47998046875	303.5845947265625	8
Polish emigrants became protagonists of the “The Polish Peasant in Europe and	128.69961547851562	552.3018188476562	9.47998046875	303.4699401855469	8
America” by THOMAS & ZNANIECKI (1918-1920) in which the proposal of	128.69961547851562	563.8218994140625	9.47998046875	303.54290771484375	8

Thus, taking into account the Polish “position” in the migration process, my	140.0395965576172	115.31494140625	9.48004150390625	292.15452575683594	10

guage.3 According to the translator she speaks German very well; this can also	128.70022583007812	304.40155029296875	11.3135986328125	303.68792724609375	13
be seen in the English version of the transcription. Hülya does not have prob-	128.7002410888672	317.754638671875	9.48004150390625	303.47181701660156	13
lems with describing feelings, emotions, motives, let alone events of her life.	128.7002410888672	329.27471923828125	9.480010986328125	303.6481475830078	13
Nevertheless, her skill at describing life experiences with the help of specifi-	128.7002410888672	340.735107421875	9.47998046875	303.63392639160156	13
cally selected symbolic categories is amazing. I particularly think of these	128.7002410888672	352.25518798828125	9.47998046875	303.5420379638672	13
narrative sequences in which she tells about the official procedures which	128.7002410888672	363.7752685546875	9.47998046875	303.6509552001953	13
contract laborers migrating to Germany had to pass through and about the	128.7002410888672	375.2356262207031	9.47998046875	303.5144500732422	13
situation of Turkish migrants in Germany. Whenever Hülya introduces this	128.7002410888672	386.7557067871094	9.47998046875	303.5761260986328	13
topic she effectively creates the image of more or less passive masses of people	128.7002410888672	398.2757873535156	9.47998046875	303.52491760253906	13
who are at the mercy of powerful authorities. For example, she uses expres-	128.7002410888672	409.73614501953125	9.47998046875	303.57322692871094	13

take a look, a close look /eh/ what is he paying for” [257-258], “no pride was	128.7002410888672	432.77630615234375	9.47998046875	303.6121063232422	13

1 This problem is discussed in the paper of GÜLTEKIN, INOWLOCKI and LUTZ presented	128.6999969482422	532.283203125	9.160919189453125	303.5025177001953	14

2 I refer to the stage of oral collective work on narrative interviews when each participant of a	128.6999969482422	550.6431884765625	9.160919189453125	303.4849090576172	14

ing the text of the interview. Although it is just an introductory step of textual interpreta-	137.2201385498047	570.2442626953125	7.980010986328125	295.08131408691406	14
tion, it is, in my opinion, very important. It enables the participants to take into account dif-	137.2201385498047	579.4244995117188	7.9799957275390625	295.13551330566406	14

3 The narrator’s language abilities are deeply analyzed by FRANCESCHINI in this issue.	128.6999969482422	596.6632080078125	9.160903930664062	289.75611877441406	14

and they expressed doubts with regard to the “sufficient capacity” of persons	128.69961547851562	115.31494140625	9.48004150390625	303.5761413574219	16
deciding to migrate. This correspondence is more pronounced when Hülya uses	128.69961547851562	126.83502197265625	9.48004150390625	303.61212158203125	16
categories belonging to the symbolic universe of the country which she had	128.69961547851562	138.29541015625	9.48004150390625	303.50408935546875	16
migrated to. For example, she makes the comparison to gas chambers in con-	128.69961547851562	149.81549072265625	9.48004150390625	303.5570983886719	16
centration camps: “We had a shower /eh/ downstairs for the whole house. It	128.69961547851562	161.3355712890625	9.48004150390625	303.6159362792969	16
looked /eh/ like gas /eh/ chambers in concentration camps, this shower. From	128.69961547851562	172.79595947265625	9.48004150390625	303.607421875	16
above /eh/. All three four /eh/ of us went in there right away because the water	128.69961547851562	184.3160400390625	9.48004150390625	303.5703125	16
always turned cold so fast” (454-457). I wonder whether she fully realizes the	128.69961547851562	195.83612060546875	9.48004150390625	303.6690368652344	16
meaning of this comparison, especially when it is used as a means of creating a	128.69961547851562	207.2965087890625	9.48004150390625	303.4908142089844	16
gloomy image of Turkish labor migrants inhumanely exploited in Germany.	128.6996307373047	218.81658935546875	9.48004150390625	289.2670135498047	16
A second comment relates to the first one. I have been amazed by the narra-	140.03961181640625	230.336669921875	9.48004150390625	292.3687744140625	16
tor’s self presentation. Hülya seems to be a person who thinks a lot (even if we	128.6996307373047	241.79705810546875	9.48004150390625	303.57423400878906	16
consider her specific biographical situation at the time of the interview) about	128.6996307373047	253.317138671875	9.48004150390625	303.6093292236328	16
her identity problems and her emotional life. In almost every narrative segment	128.6996307373047	264.83721923828125	9.48004150390625	303.56285095214844	16
she comments on her experiences. The commentaries serve to evaluate the	128.6996307373047	276.297607421875	9.48004150390625	303.70408630371094	16
narrator’s past motives from her present perspective, to refer to her past state of	128.69964599609375	287.81768798828125	9.48004150390625	303.60455322265625	16
mind, but they also serve to “plan” or introduce future events and the narrator’s	128.6996612548828	299.3377685546875	9.48004150390625	303.5751495361328	16
reactions: for example, “I was lucky or unlucky5 that I passed after all” (244),	128.6996612548828	308.9615478515625	11.316650390625	303.6765594482422	16
“somehow treated in an inhuman way, already in Istanbul” (226). These kinds	128.6995849609375	322.28802490234375	9.506622314453125	303.5846252441406	16
of commentaries in the form of short allusions show that Hülya has developed	128.6995849609375	333.8347473144531	9.47998046875	303.5296936035156	16
a distance to her biographical story and that she controls it to some extent.	128.6995849609375	345.29510498046875	9.47998046875	303.6348571777344	16
These remarks especially refer to the first part of the narrative, when Hülya	128.6995849609375	356.815185546875	9.47998046875	303.58367919921875	16
tells about her youth, and the first two years of migration. I do not suggest that	128.69956970214844	368.33526611328125	9.47998046875	303.6376495361328	16
the narration was planned and that it is not a spontaneously recounted story.6 I	128.69956970214844	377.9615173339844	11.3140869140625	303.57728576660156	16
just want to stress that this style of narration and argumentation is a distinct	128.69976806640625	391.3146667480469	9.47998046875	303.53631591796875	16
feature of Hülya’s story. In my previous research experience I very rarely read	128.69976806640625	402.8347473144531	9.47998046875	303.55816650390625	16
such narratives. If I did, they usually belonged to highly educated persons who	128.69976806640625	414.29510498046875	9.47998046875	303.4917297363281	16
had well-developed language skills and, in general, they were often used to tell	128.69976806640625	425.815185546875	9.47998046875	303.5230407714844	16
stories (for example, teachers).7 Thus, Hülya’s narrative serves as very good	128.69976806640625	435.50152587890625	11.313720703125	303.588134765625	16

My work on this interview is based on Fritz SCHÜTZE’s procedure for nar-	140.0403594970703	460.3150329589844	9.47998046875	292.21995544433594	16
rative analysis, focusing primarily on its first two steps—the analysis of	128.70037841796875	471.8351135253906	9.47998046875	303.56195068359375	16
schemes of communication and structural description.8 Nevertheless, I do not	128.70037841796875	481.4615173339844	11.313934326171875	303.5645446777344	16
5 In italics I mark expressions that allusively refer to future events which the narrator as an	128.6999969482422	513.8631591796875	9.161041259765625	303.5360870361328	17
actor could not anticipate at that specific time.	137.2201690673828	524.224365234375	7.980010986328125	147.8048553466797	17
6 Narration about biographical experiences should not be pre-rehearsed in order to reveal	128.6999969482422	532.283203125	9.160919189453125	303.6693572998047	17
what happened in the social area under study from the point of view of individuals acting in	137.22015380859375	542.6444091796875	7.980010986328125	295.072509765625	17
it (SCHÜTZE, unpublished, p.3).	137.22015380859375	551.8245849609375	7.980010986328125	106.93757629394531	17
7 In my research I mainly interview older people in Poland. I am interested in their war	128.6999969482422	559.883056640625	9.161041259765625	303.58067321777344	17
experiences and usually ask them to concentrate on this phase of their lives, with the rest of	137.22015380859375	570.244384765625	7.980010986328125	295.04937744140625	17
their lives serving as background. My research interests have focused on problems of na-	137.2201385498047	579.424560546875	7.9799957275390625	295.12913513183594	17
tional identity, displacement and the collective image of the war.	137.2201385498047	588.66455078125	7.9799957275390625	207.1926727294922	17
8 The first step aims to identify different schemes of communication which are present in a	128.6999969482422	596.6632080078125	9.160903930664062	303.66688537597656	17
story in order to analyze how much of the empirical text material is the result of extempore	137.2201385498047	607.0243530273438	7.9799957275390625	294.99818420410156	17

refer directly to this stage of analytical work, e.g., I do not present detailed	128.69961547851562	115.31494140625	9.48004150390625	303.6197814941406	19
structural descriptions of narrative segments. In my opinion, there are at least	128.69961547851562	126.83502197265625	9.48004150390625	303.7126159667969	19
two ways of presenting the approaches of dealing with the substance of the	128.69961547851562	138.29541015625	9.48004150390625	303.5789489746094	19
interview. One refers directly to analytical steps and shows the exact way of	128.69961547851562	149.81549072265625	9.48004150390625	303.5638427734375	19
proceeding, the other aims to present more general comments on the case	128.69961547851562	161.3355712890625	9.48004150390625	303.5912780761719	19
which had been studied. Here, I choose the second way of presentation, i.e., I	128.69961547851562	172.79595947265625	9.48004150390625	303.54766845703125	19
only concentrate on a specific aspect of Hülya’s experiences as a labor mi-	128.69961547851562	184.3160400390625	9.48004150390625	303.52398681640625	19
grant—her changes of identity.	128.69961547851562	195.83612060546875	9.48004150390625	118.24305725097656	19
2.2. The process of identity changes	197.5800018310547	224.93121337890625	11.52001953125	165.8061981201172	20
According to Anselm STRAUSS (1969) identity is subjected to constant proc-	128.6999969482422	244.3145751953125	9.48004150390625	303.59605407714844	21
esses of change. Although an individual tends to minimize this process and	128.6999969482422	255.83465576171875	9.48004150390625	303.57423400878906	21
establishes strategies for gaining a sense of personal continuity, transformations	128.6999969482422	267.2950439453125	9.48004150390625	303.7249298095703	21

usually processual. Following experiences gradually make an individual	128.6999969482422	290.335205078125	9.48004150390625	303.7316436767578	21
change his or her self-definitions. Changes can be marked by turning points	128.6999969482422	301.79559326171875	9.48004150390625	303.62062072753906	21
constituted by critical incidents. These moments in a biography enable an indi-	128.6999969482422	313.315673828125	9.48004150390625	303.69090270996094	21
vidual to see the change and make him or her explore and validate new aspects	128.6999969482422	324.83575439453125	9.480010986328125	303.64903259277344	21
of self (STRAUSS 1969, p.93). The biographical situation of an immigrant	128.6999969482422	336.296142578125	9.47998046875	303.5192108154297	21
generates many critical incidents which reflect the impact of this experience on	128.6999969482422	347.81622314453125	9.47998046875	303.51072692871094	21
one’s identity.	128.6999969482422	359.3363037109375	9.47998046875	54.41424560546875	21
A striking example of the ‘milestone’ is found in the autobiographies of many	140.0399932861328	372.96246337890625	9.0	283.7061309814453	21
immigrants to America who later visited their native lands, only then realizing	140.04000854492188	382.982177734375	9.0	283.93115234375	21
how little affinity they had retained, how identified they had become with	140.04000854492188	393.00189208984375	9.0	283.8563537597656	21
America and Americans. Any return home, insofar as you have really left it,	140.04000854492188	402.9621887207031	9.0	283.75201416015625	21
will signalize some sort of movement in identity (STRAUSS 1969, p.93-94).	140.04000854492188	412.9819030761719	9.0	276.8705749511719	21
Hence, past changes can usually be clearly defined and evaluated from the	128.6999969482422	427.7945861816406	9.47998046875	303.61875915527344	22
perspective of the present. In the case of the analyzed narrative, subsequent	128.6999969482422	439.3146667480469	9.47998046875	303.67845153808594	22
visits to their home country play a crucial role in the process of reflective	128.6999969482422	450.8347473144531	9.47998046875	303.60545349121094	22
awareness of an individual’s identity changes.	128.6999969482422	462.29510498046875	9.47998046875	175.2084197998047	22
The deeper the change, the more elaborated the biographical work that has	140.03997802734375	473.815185546875	9.47998046875	292.2654724121094	22
to be done in order to integrate one’s experiences into more or less coherent	128.6999969482422	485.33526611328125	9.47998046875	303.5922393798828	22
wholeness. Therefore, coming to terms with fragile aspects of one’s identity	128.6999969482422	496.7956237792969	9.47998046875	303.5665740966797	22
can be a complicated and long-time process (STRAUSS, CORBIN, GLASER,	128.6999969482422	508.315673828125	9.47998046875	303.4414825439453	22

ences that can force an individual to face totally new challenges, e.g., illness	128.6999969482422	531.296142578125	9.47998046875	303.6167755126953	22
and physical disability. Biographical narrative interviews are very rich data for	128.6999969482422	542.8162231445312	9.47998046875	303.67945861816406	22
analyzing this process of identity change and a narrator’s biographical work on	128.6999969482422	554.3363037109375	9.47998046875	303.6188201904297	22
it because in his or her story the narrator reconstructs the processual logic of	128.6999969482422	565.796630859375	9.47998046875	303.62913513183594	22

events (HERMANNS, 1987, p.50). In the case that we are dealing with here,	128.69961547851562	115.31494140625	9.48004150390625	303.61968994140625	25
the narrator has serious problems with her poor health that surely influence her	128.69961547851562	126.83502197265625	9.48004150390625	303.6642761230469	25
self image, as can be seen in various segments of her interview.	128.69961547851562	138.29541015625	9.48004150390625	241.44992065429688	25
I am going to reconstruct the experiences of Hülya’s biography which initi-	140.04054260253906	149.81549072265625	9.48004150390625	292.23707580566406	25
ated the process of identity change, and present her biographical work on it.	128.7005615234375	161.3355712890625	9.48004150390625	303.5334167480469	25
However, I do not concentrate on Hülya’s experience with illness; I will only	128.7005615234375	172.79595947265625	9.48004150390625	303.5059509277344	25
refer to those dimensions of her biography that are related to the collective	128.7005615234375	184.3160400390625	9.48004150390625	303.6519470214844	25
aspect of her experiences connected with the process of migration. In this con-	128.7005615234375	195.83612060546875	9.48004150390625	303.5979309082031	25
text, identity changes can be commented on from two perspectives. The first is	128.7005615234375	207.2965087890625	9.48004150390625	303.62261962890625	25
related to Hülya’s life course when the naive girl (which appears from the first	128.70054626464844	218.81658935546875	9.48004150390625	303.5410614013672	25
pages of the narrative) changes into the mature woman. The second is related to	128.70054626464844	230.336669921875	9.48004150390625	303.6679229736328	25
the narrator’s cultural background. Social and cultural differences between	128.70054626464844	241.79705810546875	9.48004150390625	303.60450744628906	25
Turkey and Germany refer to (among others) differently defined roles of	128.70054626464844	253.317138671875	9.48004150390625	303.6045379638672	25
women in each society. In Hülya’s biography these two perspectives are	128.70053100585938	264.83721923828125	9.48004150390625	303.59979248046875	25
closely related to each other. Her redefinition of her identity can be understood	128.70053100585938	276.297607421875	9.48004150390625	303.7002868652344	25
against this background.	128.70053100585938	287.81768798828125	9.48004150390625	92.62150573730469	25
I refer to the following stages of her biography: Hülya as a young girl, the	140.04051208496094	299.3377685546875	9.48004150390625	292.22291564941406	25
first and the second year of her stay in Germany, and the next four years of her	128.70053100585938	310.79815673828125	9.48004150390625	303.5931396484375	25
migration.	128.70053100585938	322.3182373046875	9.480010986328125	39.29460144042969	25
2.3. Hülya as a young girl	220.9199981689453	351.4712219238281	11.519989013671875	119.17897033691406	26
At the beginning of the interview Hülya remembers her childhood and she	128.6999969482422	370.7945861816406	9.47998046875	303.62644958496094	27
presents herself as a teenage girl living in a typical rural Turkish family. She	128.6999969482422	382.3146667480469	9.47998046875	303.6576385498047	27
seems to be a sensitive and intelligent girl. The relatively good life of her fam-	128.6999969482422	393.8347473144531	9.47998046875	303.5846405029297	27
ily and her happy childhood are disturbed by her father’s illness and his inabil-	128.6999969482422	405.29510498046875	9.47998046875	303.5514678955078	27
ity to work. Since that moment, poverty becomes the dominant experience of	128.6999969482422	416.815185546875	9.47998046875	303.6994171142578	27
her family life. Hülya, the girl, analyzes its consequences: no future for her and	128.6999969482422	428.33526611328125	9.47998046875	303.59034729003906	27
her siblings and a miserable position for her mother in the family. She realizes	128.6999969482422	439.7956237792969	9.47998046875	303.61878967285156	27
that her mother will be permanently dependent on male members of the family.	128.6999969482422	451.3157043457031	9.47998046875	303.65184020996094	27
The girl also discovers what is going on “outside” of her life: She discovers	128.6999969482422	462.8357849121094	9.47998046875	303.70689392089844	27
that those Turks living in Germany are well off.	128.6999969482422	474.296142578125	9.47998046875	181.87754821777344	27
The poverty of her family is the first important experience of Hülya as the	140.03997802734375	485.81622314453125	9.47998046875	292.2447509765625	27
young girl. This stage of her biography has distinct features of trajectory9 initi-	128.6999969482422	495.50152587890625	11.31475830078125	303.58192443847656	27
ated by the unexpected illness of her father. The memory of a relatively good	128.70010375976562	508.794921875	9.47998046875	303.5950927734375	27
childhood is replaced by the experience of poverty. She gradually realizes that	128.70010375976562	520.3150634765625	9.47998046875	303.5438232421875	27
there is no future for her and her family: “it was ... a calamity” (161). Hülya’s	128.70010375976562	531.8350830078125	9.47998046875	303.5618896484375	27
dream about Germany has become the only positive project for the future. The	128.7000732421875	543.2954711914062	9.47998046875	303.532470703125	27
teenage girl creates the image of her life: her temporary stay in Germany will	128.7000732421875	554.8155517578125	9.47998046875	303.6842041015625	27
9 Biographical “trajectory” is used here in the sense of one of structural processes of the life	128.6999969482422	578.2431640625	9.160964965820312	303.6931915283203	28
course that represents the principle of being overwhelmed by outer events of the life course	137.22015380859375	588.6641845703125	7.9799957275390625	295.0931701660156	28
which cannot be controlled by the biography incumbent. Suffering is the basic experiential	137.2201690673828	597.8443603515625	7.9799957275390625	295.05982971191406	28
mode of biographical trajectory (RIEMANN & SCHÜTZE, 1992).	137.22018432617188	607.0245361328125	7.9799957275390625	213.97970581054688	28

change the economic status of the family. This thought has become a base of	128.69961547851562	115.31494140625	9.48004150390625	303.6490783691406	30
her biographical action scheme.10 Such a project appears to be typical at this	128.69961547851562	125.00152587890625	11.31353759765625	303.5028991699219	30
stage of the migration process when a person creates positive plans for the	128.70033264160156	138.294921875	9.48004150390625	303.4869842529297	30
future. The plans are “located” in the immigrant-receiving society (RIEMANN	128.70033264160156	149.81500244140625	9.48004150390625	303.62062072753906	30
& SCHÜTZE, 1992). In Hülya’s case a biographical action scheme appears	128.70033264160156	161.3350830078125	9.48004150390625	303.56004333496094	30
very early, when the girl cannot realize it yet because she is too young. At the	128.70034790039062	172.79547119140625	9.48004150390625	303.6150207519531	30
beginning it is just a dream and as long as the project is a dream Hülya’s ex-	128.70034790039062	184.3155517578125	9.48004150390625	303.5732116699219	30
periences are related to intentional, planned social action regarding her future	128.70034790039062	195.83563232421875	9.48004150390625	303.6254577636719	30
life. To some extent, her plan resembles a fairy tale—the teenage girl wants to	128.70034790039062	207.2960205078125	9.48004150390625	303.51165771484375	30
become a fairy and change her family life. The more real the project becomes	128.70034790039062	218.81610107421875	9.48004150390625	303.67083740234375	30
the less it remains a dream.	128.70034790039062	230.336181640625	9.48004150390625	103.32063293457031	30
Hülya’s plan is contrasted with her parents’ project for her life: “No, you	140.0403289794922	241.79656982421875	9.48004150390625	292.2939910888672	30
won’t go to Germany, you will stay here and one day you will get married	128.70034790039062	253.3145751953125	9.48211669921875	303.6161804199219	30
and/and your husband /eh/ to take care of you” (157-158). But soon her parents	128.6996612548828	264.83465576171875	9.48004150390625	303.67759704589844	30
change their minds and start supporting their daughter in her project, which	128.6996612548828	276.2950439453125	9.48004150390625	303.61875915527344	30
also becomes their plan to solve the difficult situation of the family. Slowly,	128.6996612548828	287.81512451171875	9.48004150390625	303.58839416503906	30
Hülya loses the ability of acting intentionally. Her parents and her brother start	128.6996612548828	299.335205078125	9.48004150390625	303.64723205566406	30
working on her project instead of her. The girl’s biographical action scheme is	128.6996612548828	310.79559326171875	9.48004150390625	303.6149444580078	30
stopped at the stage of a great dream, whereas she starts to be gradually pushed	128.6996612548828	322.315673828125	9.480010986328125	303.60740661621094	30
into a sequence of events that overwhelm her biography.	128.6996612548828	333.8357849121094	9.47998046875	215.2206268310547	30
But from the present perspective Hülya also attributes another meaning to	140.03964233398438	345.296142578125	9.47998046875	292.2796936035156	30
these experiences. The father’s quoted words, when analyzed from the present	128.6996612548828	356.81622314453125	9.47998046875	303.5998077392578	30
perspective of her biography, can be treated as a symbol of Hülya’s image of	128.6996612548828	368.3363037109375	9.47998046875	303.62059020996094	30
life in Turkish society. She was expected to become an obedient woman who	128.6996612548828	379.7966613769531	9.47998046875	303.5258331298828	30
would depend and rely on her future husband. Here, we can find one of the	128.6996612548828	391.3167419433594	9.47998046875	303.6548309326172	30
most important motives for her migration. As the teenage girl, Hülya wants to	128.6996612548828	402.8368225097656	9.47998046875	303.6367645263672	30
improve the financial status of her family, but after some time it appears that	128.6996612548828	414.29718017578125	9.47998046875	303.63206481933594	30
she wants something more for herself—she wants to become more “independ-	128.6996612548828	425.8172607421875	9.47998046875	303.52113342285156	30
ent” from socially and culturally defined roles of a woman reflected in Turkish	128.6996612548828	437.33734130859375	9.47998046875	303.6083526611328	30
culture. She also does not want to be manipulated as she was when her family	128.6996612548828	448.7976989746094	9.47998046875	303.58470153808594	30
worked on her leaving for Germany. This project becomes clear from the per-	128.6996612548828	460.3177795410156	9.47998046875	303.69834899902344	30
spective of further life experiences, but the process of its crystallization begins	128.6996612548828	471.8378601074219	9.47998046875	303.59217834472656	30
at this moment. “... I wanted to be independent somehow, but I didn’t know:	128.6996612548828	483.2982177734375	9.47998046875	303.67189025878906	30
how, you know, but I also didn’t think about what would await me in Germany	128.6996612548828	494.81829833984375	9.47998046875	303.6196746826172	30
or so” (159-161).	128.6996612548828	506.33837890625	9.47998046875	65.7608642578125	30
10 I use quotation marks in order to stress that, in fact, Hülya’s departure for Germany was not	128.6999969482422	596.6632080078125	9.160903930664062	303.60133361816406	31
a realization of the dream that she had as the young girl.	137.2200927734375	607.0243530273438	7.9799957275390625	179.46224975585938	31

The “dream”11 comes true. Leaving the family is very difficult. The seventeen	128.6999969482422	150.50152587890625	11.31304931640625	303.6345977783203	34
year old girl enters the unknown world. The clash of her naive expectations	128.69964599609375	163.794921875	9.48004150390625	303.6036376953125	34
with the reality which she encounters is very tragic. This experience is typical	128.69964599609375	175.31500244140625	9.48004150390625	303.5941467285156	34
for a migrant biography when an individual having positive plans looks for a	128.69964599609375	186.8350830078125	9.48004150390625	303.55810546875	34
better future and gets disappointed by the circumstances and difficulties met at	128.69964599609375	198.29547119140625	9.48004150390625	303.6215515136719	34
the place of migration. Instead of developing biographical action schemes an	128.69964599609375	209.8155517578125	9.48004150390625	303.55810546875	34
individual may enter a trajectory (RIEMANN & SCHÜTZE, 1992). In the case	128.6996612548828	221.33563232421875	9.48004150390625	303.6377410888672	34
of Hülya these experiences are intensified by the girl’s vulnerability due to her	128.69964599609375	232.7960205078125	9.48004150390625	303.6719665527344	34
young age. Although Hülya had been pushed by her family to migrate, she still	128.69964599609375	244.31610107421875	9.48004150390625	303.6273498535156	34
has in mind her plan of improving the economic situation of the family.12 As a	128.69964599609375	254.00152587890625	11.314697265625	303.54632568359375	34
result, she is subjected to very harmful experiences related to both collective	128.70016479492188	267.294921875	9.48004150390625	303.55340576171875	34

pears to be very difficult. She is forced to work in terrible conditions, but, at the	128.70016479492188	301.79547119140625	9.48004150390625	303.6330261230469	34
same time, she cannot return home:	128.70018005371094	313.3155517578125	9.48004150390625	135.0615692138672	34
Well, I already wanted to give up in the beginning, to run away. I said, ‘I	140.0399932861328	327.00244140625	9.0	283.85633850097656	35
don’t care if I have money or not. I don’t want to stay here.’ But I /eh/ also	140.0399932861328	336.9627380371094	9.0	283.81675720214844	35
didn’t have money. When I came to Germany we had to take money from	140.0399932861328	346.9824523925781	9.0	283.7061004638672	35
other people. First, I had debts, that was an affair of honour, I had to pay this	140.03997802734375	357.0021667480469	9.0	283.7601013183594	35
back. And, second, I always thought, no one will believe me when I tell them	140.03997802734375	366.96246337890625	9.0	283.90594482421875	35
what /ehm/ has happened in Germany. And they will think that I might have	140.0399932861328	376.982177734375	9.000274658203125	283.67823791503906	35
stolen something. Or... and therefore the police has sent me home and so on. I	140.04000854492188	387.0021667480469	9.0	283.92474365234375	35
say, ‘No’ and: I was also too proud to return again. To stay here was also /eh/	140.04000854492188	396.96246337890625	9.0	283.72589111328125	35
hell somehow (322-329).	140.04000854492188	406.982177734375	9.000274658203125	90.85498046875	35
In the quoted segment, Hülya analyzes her situation and gives the arguments	128.6999969482422	421.7945861816406	9.47998046875	303.6206817626953	36
preventing her from going home. All the reasons are related to collective ex-	128.6999969482422	433.3146667480469	9.47998046875	303.6461639404297	36
pectations and evaluations of her behavior. First, she had to pay back the debts	128.6999969482422	444.8347473144531	9.47998046875	303.6348419189453	36
that were a matter of honor to her family. Hülya says “I had to pay this back”	128.6999969482422	456.29510498046875	9.47998046875	303.6831817626953	36
but I suppose that it was her father who had borrowed the money. Nevertheless,	128.6999969482422	467.815185546875	9.47998046875	303.6482696533203	36
she felt responsible for delivering it. Second, Hülya felt that describing what	128.6999969482422	479.33526611328125	9.47998046875	303.67665100097656	36
she had gone through would be doubted because of the prevalent collective	128.6999969482422	490.7956237792969	9.47998046875	303.67381286621094	36
image of Germany as a welfare state. She suspected that this image was too	128.6999969482422	502.3157043457031	9.47998046875	303.50502014160156	36
strong to be shaken and she was afraid of being accused of not being equal to	128.6999969482422	513.8358154296875	9.47998046875	303.5050506591797	36
the task she had taken on. Thus, Hülya is in a tragic situation, because although	128.6999969482422	525.296142578125	9.47998046875	303.5410614013672	36
11 A biographical action scheme is one of the structural processes of the life course represent-	128.6999969482422	550.6431884765625	9.160919189453125	303.5782012939453	37
ing intentional and long range planned social action regarding one’s own life (SCHÜTZE,	137.21926879882812	561.0640869140625	7.980010986328125	295.1300048828125	37

12 We can assume that if the circumstances of work in Germany had not been inhumane,	128.6999969482422	578.2431640625	9.160964965820312	303.6428680419922	37
perhaps she would have been able to develop (or rather come back to) a biographical action	137.2200927734375	588.6641845703125	7.9799957275390625	295.0501708984375	37

solution must cause suffering. The experience of trajectory is developing and it	128.69961547851562	126.83502197265625	9.48004150390625	303.6377258300781	39
is strengthened by Hülya’s accidents which make her suffer (physically) more	128.69961547851562	138.29541015625	9.48004150390625	303.57696533203125	39

The first year in Germany may be described in the context of the entire life	140.0395965576172	161.3355712890625	9.48004150390625	292.1811981201172	39
story as “a hard school of life.” The seventeen year old girl has to face unex-	128.69961547851562	172.79595947265625	9.48004150390625	303.468017578125	39
pected experiences, do things she would never do in her country: endure pain	128.69961547851562	184.3160400390625	9.48004150390625	303.6604919433594	39
and physical disability. Some of these experiences (like her poor health) will	128.69961547851562	195.83612060546875	9.48004150390625	303.66619873046875	39
accompany further phases of Hülya’s biography. Nevertheless, the first year	128.69961547851562	207.2965087890625	9.48004150390625	303.51824951171875	39
remains the outstanding phase of suddenly passing from the naiveté of teenage	128.69961547851562	218.81658935546875	9.48004150390625	303.5694885253906	39
life to the maturity of young adulthood. However, these changes are still not	128.69961547851562	230.336669921875	9.48004150390625	303.5769958496094	39
supported by changes in Hülya’s image of belonging to Turkish culture. She	128.69961547851562	241.79705810546875	9.48004150390625	303.57318115234375	39
continues to act according to culturally defined patterns. It can be seen in the	128.69961547851562	253.317138671875	9.48004150390625	303.55340576171875	39
above presented argument in which she relates her decisions to the expectations	128.69961547851562	264.83721923828125	9.48004150390625	303.69549560546875	39

Thus, Hülya continues at this stage of her biography to define herself with	140.0395965576172	287.81768798828125	9.48004150390625	292.23521423339844	39
the help of well known categories from her (Turkish) community. She accepts	128.69961547851562	299.3377685546875	9.48004150390625	303.6073913574219	39
her situation of depending on the expectations of others, including German	128.69961547851562	310.79815673828125	9.48004150390625	303.7040710449219	39

dence for the next year of her stay (418-448). She, as well as other Turkish	128.69961547851562	368.3388671875	9.47998046875	303.6111145019531	39
girls, did not have an idea of “What’s that supposed to be?” (429-430), how to	128.69961547851562	379.7992248535156	9.47998046875	303.56280517578125	39

done it for us” (447-448).	128.69961547851562	425.81982421875	9.47998046875	97.39181518554688	39
The story about the permit of residence points out a few aspects of Hülya’s	140.0395965576172	437.33990478515625	9.47998046875	292.23143005371094	39
biographical experiences of that time. I have mentioned the first aspect: another	128.69961547851562	448.8002624511719	9.47998046875	303.6253356933594	39
biographical experience is related to Hülya’s specific vulnerability due to her	128.69961547851562	460.3203430175781	9.47998046875	303.4964599609375	39
young age. The second aspect refers to the situation of her migrant group (I	128.69961547851562	471.8404235839844	9.47998046875	303.65008544921875	39
presume, Turkish migrant workers in general). The migrants are treated as	128.69961547851562	483.30078125	9.47998046875	303.6111755371094	39
passive parts of a working machine and they seem to comply with these cir-	128.69960021972656	494.82086181640625	9.47998046875	303.5287322998047	39
cumstances: “... we didn’t carry this through ourselves, the firm did every-	128.69960021972656	506.3409423828125	9.47998046875	303.7089385986328	39
thing” (420-421). They have no idea what their rights as workers are. Hence,	128.69960021972656	517.80126953125	9.47998046875	303.58848571777344	39
they can be easily abused by the firm. Therefore, Hülya expresses in her story	128.69960021972656	529.3214111328125	9.47998046875	303.6226043701172	39
the feeling of injustice. But the migrant workers also do not know enough	128.69960021972656	540.8414306640625	9.47998046875	303.5467071533203	39
about legal requirements which they have to meet as foreign citizens. There-	128.69960021972656	552.3018188476562	9.47998046875	303.6206817626953	39
fore, Hülya has no chance to act intentionally and she also does not feel the	128.69960021972656	563.8218994140625	9.47998046875	303.6547393798828	39
need to build her independence.	128.69960021972656	575.3419799804688	9.47998046875	121.18092346191406	39

2.5. The second year of Hülya’s stay in Germany	167.39999389648438	132.95123291015625	11.52001953125	226.08346557617188	41
During her first year in Germany Hülya lives as if in two worlds. One world is	128.6999969482422	152.33453369140625	9.48004150390625	303.61399841308594	42
her work, the second world is the community of girls in the dormitory. All of	128.6999969482422	163.794921875	9.48004150390625	303.60081481933594	42
them are in the same situation. In the second year Hülya loses her peer group	128.6999969482422	175.31500244140625	9.48004150390625	303.6519317626953	42
which has been, aside from her family, her only reference group. For the first	128.6999969482422	186.8350830078125	9.48004150390625	303.62733459472656	42
time she feels totally alone. She characterizes the second year as “a hard blow.”	128.6999969482422	198.29547119140625	9.48004150390625	303.5904083251953	42
The first year of her stay in Germany includes the experience of hard physical	128.6999969482422	209.8155517578125	9.48004150390625	303.6158905029297	42
work and physical suffering. In the second year she learns how to cope with the	128.6999969482422	221.33563232421875	9.48004150390625	303.5466766357422	42
feeling of loneliness, and it appears to be even more difficult.	128.6999969482422	232.7960205078125	9.48004150390625	233.3426055908203	42
Hülya starts living with Turks who have been in Germany much longer than	140.03997802734375	244.31610107421875	9.48004150390625	292.3385314941406	42
she has. As she recalls:	128.6999969482422	255.836181640625	9.48004150390625	87.85304260253906	42
I was ../eh/ totally different /eh/ from how I am today. I am still sentimental,	140.0399932861328	269.46240234375	9.0	283.88963317871094	43
sensible today and I tend to act emotionally. I am not able to not look straight	140.0399932861328	279.4822998046875	9.0	283.7847137451172	43

ficial people. I don’t like them either. But in former days I was even ..even	140.040283203125	299.46234130859375	9.00006103515625	283.86871337890625	43
more sensible/ I have (it) from home. Human things and and love and comfort	140.03970336914062	309.48211669921875	9.0	283.6539001464844	43
were important for us and only machines were important here. The humans	140.03968811035156	319.5018310546875	9.0	283.77268981933594	43
were not important. And then we were just /eh/ ... people practically who did	140.0396728515625	329.462158203125	9.0	283.7169494628906	43
the work, we didn’t count as something else. But that made me so sad because	140.03965759277344	339.48187255859375	9.000579833984375	283.7385711669922	43
our people had also become like that. Those had already been here for a	140.03968811035156	349.5021667480469	9.000274658203125	283.7487335205078	43
couple of years, just money, nothing else, you know. They just wanted to have	140.0399932861328	359.4627380371094	9.0	283.8158721923828	43
money (518-527).	140.0399932861328	369.4824523925781	9.0	65.04570007324219	43
In the quoted segment of the commentary Hülya refers to her experience of	128.6999969482422	384.2945861816406	9.47998046875	303.5969696044922	44
loneliness and suffering caused by longing for her family. These feelings are	128.6999969482422	395.8146667480469	9.47998046875	303.6405487060547	44
intensified by the comparison to the first year of her stay in Germany, when	128.6999969482422	407.3347473144531	9.47998046875	303.63682556152344	44
they could be soothed, at least to some extent, by her belonging to the peer	128.6999969482422	418.79510498046875	9.47998046875	303.6310272216797	44
group. Now Hülya has to cope with new experiences that create feelings of	128.6999969482422	430.315185546875	9.47998046875	303.55906677246094	44
being different that are expressed at the beginning of the quoted segment. Then	128.6999969482422	441.83526611328125	9.47998046875	303.60169982910156	44
the narrator presents arguments to justify this feeling. Although she had already	128.6999969482422	453.2956237792969	9.47998046875	303.59034729003906	44
mentioned the lack of interest of other Turks when she arrived in Germany, it	128.6999969482422	464.8157043457031	9.47998046875	303.6462860107422	44
is, in my opinion, the first time she really feels that she distances herself from	128.6999969482422	476.3357849121094	9.47998046875	303.6262969970703	44
other fellow Turks. There is a generation gap between her as a teenage girl and	128.6999969482422	487.796142578125	9.47998046875	303.67848205566406	44
her adult co-tenants. Hülya strongly experiences the clash of worlds. She de-	128.6999969482422	499.31622314453125	9.47998046875	303.6395721435547	44
fines it not only in categories of age differences but also as a discrepancy be-	128.6999969482422	510.8363037109375	9.47998046875	303.6471710205078	44
tween her own world full of positive feelings and based on family life (perhaps	128.6999969482422	522.296630859375	9.47998046875	303.64341735839844	44
a little idealized) and the world of Turkish (adult) immigrants to whom money	128.6999969482422	533.8167724609375	9.47998046875	303.5866241455078	44
seems to be the most important value. Hülya builds a contrast between herself,	128.6999969482422	545.3367919921875	9.47998046875	303.58082580566406	44

resenting, in fact, a German style of life. This contrast is very important be-	128.6999969482422	568.3172607421875	9.47998046875	303.61875915527344	44
cause for the first time she does not define herself as a member of the commu-	128.6999969482422	579.83740234375	9.480010986328125	303.5438690185547	44
nity that she formally joins, and she feels like an outsider in the group of her	128.6999969482422	591.2977294921875	9.479995727539062	303.5836639404297	44
fellow country women and men. I regard this moment as one of the crucial	128.6999969482422	602.81787109375	9.480010986328125	303.5685577392578	44
81	275.760009765625	626.69458007
turning points in the process of Hülya’s identity changes. Since that time the	128.69961547851562	115.31494140625	9.48004150390625	303.5239562988281	46
experience of being different has become the basic means to describe the narra-	128.69961547851562	126.83502197265625	9.48004150390625	303.4917297363281	46
tor’s identity.	128.69961547851562	138.29541015625	9.48004150390625	51.28016662597656	46
In the analyzed fragment the difference is expressed by the reference to	140.0395965576172	149.81549072265625	9.48004150390625	292.2029571533203	46
other Turkish labor migrants and to her own image when the narrator tries to	128.69961547851562	161.3355712890625	9.48004150390625	303.6263427734375	46
evaluate her changes of identity from the perspective of the present. Now she	128.69961547851562	172.79595947265625	9.48004150390625	303.5950927734375	46
regards herself as a person who, in the course of life, lost at least some part of	128.69961547851562	184.3160400390625	9.48004150390625	303.6073303222656	46
her sensibility and who had to redefine her identity. The statement: “I was.../eh	128.69961547851562	195.83612060546875	9.48004150390625	303.63299560546875	46
totally different from how I am today” (518-519) can be fully understood in the	128.6996307373047	207.2965087890625	9.48004150390625	303.5581512451172	46
context of the next phases of her biography.	128.6996307373047	218.81658935546875	9.48004150390625	166.90394592285156	46
Being different is variously experienced during Hülya’s life course. Though	140.03961181640625	230.336669921875	9.48004150390625	292.2275695800781	46
the process of identity change is continuously developing, Hülya is still not	128.6996307373047	241.79705810546875	9.48004150390625	303.6547393798828	46
conscious of its character (this can be determined from the present perspective)	128.6996307373047	253.317138671875	9.48004150390625	303.5666046142578	46
and intensity. Nevertheless, at this phase of her biography, the experience of	128.6996307373047	264.83721923828125	9.48004150390625	303.67283630371094	46
being different becomes a “key experience” which step by step results in dis-	128.6996307373047	276.297607421875	9.48004150390625	303.47181701660156	46
tancing herself from her family and values offered by Turkish society.	128.6996307373047	287.81768798828125	9.48004150390625	266.77000427246094	46
2.6. The next four years	225.5399932861328	316.97119140625	11.52001953125	109.95036315917969	47
There are two main lines at this stage of Hülya’s biography: her marriage and	128.6999969482422	336.2945861816406	9.47998046875	303.5021514892578	48
phases of serious illness. This part of the narrative is not as clear as the story	128.6999969482422	347.8146667480469	9.47998046875	303.53343200683594	48
about the narrator’s first two years in Germany. But while the ambiguity of her	128.6999969482422	359.3347473144531	9.47998046875	303.6025848388672	48
illness as it appears in her narrative is the result of doctors’ silence, the vague-	128.6999969482422	370.79510498046875	9.47998046875	303.5694122314453	48
ness of Hülya’s story about her marriage shows that she tries to block from	128.6999969482422	382.315185546875	9.47998046875	303.6405487060547	48

transformation of her identity is still in process.	128.6999969482422	405.2956237792969	9.47998046875	180.55320739746094	48
In 1976 (four years after leaving home) Hülya gets married in Turkey. Dur-	140.03997802734375	416.8157043457031	9.47998046875	292.2229309082031	48
ing these years she has been thinking about returning home: “I didn’t want to	128.6999969482422	428.3357849121094	9.47998046875	303.5267791748047	48
return to Germany. I wanted to go back to Turkey. I could not imagine that I	128.6999969482422	439.796142578125	9.47998046875	303.6813507080078	48
/eh/ would endure this here for fourteen years” (546-548). There are a few	128.6999969482422	451.31622314453125	9.47998046875	303.6358184814453	48
reasons that make her treat her stay in Germany as a short episode in her biog-	128.6999969482422	462.8363037109375	9.47998046875	303.6367645263672	48
raphy. First, she has always planned a temporary stay in Germany; second, the	128.6999969482422	474.2966613769531	9.47998046875	303.51918029785156	48
first years in Germany were connected with experiences of suffering; third, she	128.6999969482422	485.8167419433594	9.47998046875	303.5154266357422	48
is strongly attached to her family, especially to her mother (from another part	128.6999969482422	497.3368225097656	9.47998046875	303.68528747558594	48
of the narrative we can learn that she has always had a close relationship with	128.6999969482422	508.79718017578125	9.47998046875	303.6130828857422	48
her mother); and fourth, Germany is still a distant country—she does not speak	128.6999969482422	520.3172607421875	9.47998046875	303.61781311035156	48
German and she has no relationships with German people. All these reasons	128.6999969482422	531.8373413085938	9.47998046875	303.60545349121094	48

Hülya describes her marriage in two parts of the narrative (546-573 and	140.03997802734375	554.8177490234375	9.47998046875	292.17352294921875	48
671-731) which are divided by the long story about the health problems she	128.6999969482422	566.337890625	9.47998046875	303.53819274902344	48
experienced when she went back to Germany for a year as a newly married	128.6999969482422	577.7982177734375	9.479995727539062	303.55897521972656	48
woman. I do not always refer to both segments chronologically when looking	128.6999969482422	589.318359375	9.480010986328125	303.6130828857422	48
for reasons for Hülya’s decisions concerning and explanations of her failure.	128.6999969482422	600.8384399414062	9.479995727539062	303.63963317871094	48

There are two significant dimensions of the narrator’s experiences: one is	128.69961547851562	115.31494140625	9.48004150390625	303.5638122558594	50
Hülya’s attitude to her marriage, the other is the role of her mother in arranging	128.69961547851562	126.83502197265625	9.48004150390625	303.56671142578125	50
the marriage.	128.69961547851562	138.29541015625	9.48004150390625	50.08282470703125	50
Hülya’s attitude towards her marriage is shaped by the process of a gradual	140.0395965576172	149.81549072265625	9.48004150390625	292.1603546142578	50
change in her identity. The experiences that she reported earlier played a cru-	128.69961547851562	161.3355712890625	9.48004150390625	303.6017150878906	50
cial role in the process of redefining her identity. But Hülya can recognize their	128.69961547851562	172.79595947265625	9.48004150390625	303.597900390625	50
meaning from the more distant time perspective—her marriage begins the	128.69961547851562	184.3160400390625	9.48004150390625	303.6595153808594	50
process of conscious reflection on her identity. Hülya has spent four years in	128.69961547851562	195.83612060546875	9.48004150390625	303.5069274902344	50
Germany but in deciding to get married she negates experiences she has gained	128.69961547851562	207.2965087890625	9.48004150390625	303.4955749511719	50
during this time. She acts according to well known patterns which are tradi-	128.69961547851562	218.81658935546875	9.48004150390625	303.7097473144531	50
tionally grounded in Turkish society—“One day you will get married and/and	128.69961547851562	230.336669921875	9.48004150390625	303.5752258300781	50
your husband has /eh/ to take care of you” (157-158). So she gets married. But	128.69961547851562	241.79705810546875	9.48004150390625	303.58941650390625	50
soon she feels uncomfortable in the new situation because she cannot adjust, or,	128.69961547851562	253.317138671875	9.48004150390625	303.6842041015625	50
rather, come back to the role of the Turkish woman. Hülya gradually begins	128.69961547851562	264.83721923828125	9.48004150390625	303.5420227050781	50
identifying herself as a person who no longer can act according to the expecta-	128.69961547851562	276.297607421875	9.48004150390625	303.5799255371094	50
tions of her traditional environment. Experiences of her stay in Germany ac-	128.69961547851562	287.81768798828125	9.48004150390625	303.6491394042969	50
quire a new meaning in the process of her interpretation of her biographical	128.69961547851562	299.3377685546875	9.48004150390625	303.55718994140625	50

Hülya tries to explain why she decides to get married. She does not love her	140.0395965576172	322.3182373046875	9.480010986328125	292.20579528808594	50
future husband and she also does not have a chance to get familiar with him	128.69961547851562	333.8383483886719	9.47998046875	303.6121520996094	50
and develop emotional attachments. She spent this phase of her life course	128.69961547851562	345.2987060546875	9.47998046875	303.60638427734375	50
working very hard in Germany. In this description Hülya presents two scenar-	128.69961547851562	356.81878662109375	9.47998046875	303.62255859375	50
ios of the young girl. The first one is the preplanned marriage of convenience	128.69961547851562	368.3388671875	9.47998046875	303.5210876464844	50
which is supported by both families. The second one is getting to know some-	128.69961547851562	379.7992248535156	9.47998046875	303.5400390625	50
body as the result of being a member of a peer group. As she sees it, one of the	128.69961547851562	391.3193054199219	9.47998046875	303.5855407714844	50
scenarios is part of traditional Turkish culture, the other, of Western culture.	128.69961547851562	402.8393859863281	9.47998046875	303.59503173828125	50
Although Hülya does not miss the Western teenage life style and she subordi-	128.69960021972656	414.29974365234375	9.47998046875	303.66807556152344	50
nates herself to her family, it is important that she has already learned that there	128.69960021972656	425.81982421875	9.47998046875	303.66612243652344	50
exists another possibility for a girl/woman to plan her biography. Perhaps as	128.69960021972656	437.33990478515625	9.47998046875	303.6936798095703	50
the result of this knowledge, she makes her husband accept a one year leave for	128.69960021972656	448.8002624511719	9.47998046875	303.64537048339844	50
Germany in order to keep at least some independence in her future marriage.	128.69960021972656	460.3203430175781	9.47998046875	291.5413360595703	50
The situation when a newly married woman is leaving her husband and ne-	140.03958129882812	471.8404235839844	9.47998046875	292.24176025390625	50
gotiating as long a leave as possible (Hülya prefers two years) appears rather	128.69960021972656	483.30078125	9.47998046875	303.57606506347656	50
bizarre if looking at it from the outside. A question arises: Why does she dis-	128.69960021972656	494.82086181640625	9.47998046875	303.5164031982422	50
tance herself from family life which she treats as the most important value?	128.69960021972656	506.3409423828125	9.47998046875	303.6548614501953	50
The answer is related to her identity changes. Hülya does not neglect family	128.69960021972656	517.80126953125	9.47998046875	303.63865661621094	50
ties as such, but she cannot accept herself in the role of a traditional Turkish	128.69960021972656	529.3214111328125	9.47998046875	303.60267639160156	50
wife. Thus, the process of the destruction of Hülya’s marriage starts from its	128.69960021972656	540.8414306640625	9.47998046875	303.57606506347656	50
very beginning. The only motives to get married are identification with the	128.69960021972656	552.3018188476562	9.47998046875	303.55055236816406	50
Turkish culture and expectations of others (mother and father) and these mo-	128.69960021972656	563.8218994140625	9.47998046875	303.64149475097656	50
tives gradually weaken.	128.69960021972656	575.3419799804688	9.47998046875	89.89598083496094	50
It is interesting to compare Hülya’s way of argumentation with the previ-	140.03958129882812	586.8023681640625	9.480010986328125	292.20196533203125	50
ously quoted commentary. Now she says:	128.69960021972656	598.3224487304688	9.479995727539062	158.3889923095703	50

and so that I ... can tell (them) at least that I had been to Germany and that I	140.04029846191406	134.46246337890625	9.0	283.8357391357422	52

Here Hülya uses arguments that she previously neglected when accusing “ex-	128.6999969482422	169.3145751953125	9.48004150390625	303.54393005371094	53
perienced” Turkish immigrants of appreciating money as the most important	128.6999969482422	180.83465576171875	9.48004150390625	303.6253204345703	53
value. Now she acts in a similar way. On the other hand, she wants to go back	128.6999969482422	192.2950439453125	9.48004150390625	303.6054229736328	53
to Germany in order to make sense of the hard work she experienced there	128.6999969482422	203.81512451171875	9.48004150390625	303.62632751464844	53
from the very beginning. Hülya devoted four years of her life to support her	128.6999969482422	215.335205078125	9.48004150390625	303.5970001220703	53
family, now she wants to turn these hard experiences to her advantage.	128.6999969482422	226.79559326171875	9.48004150390625	268.9077606201172	53
After a year Hülya returns from Germany with serious health problems. She	140.03997802734375	238.315673828125	9.48004150390625	292.1356201171875	53
expects that her husband and his family will also experience her suffering as	128.6999969482422	249.83575439453125	9.48004150390625	303.6491241455078	53
their (family) problem. But to the contrary, Hülya’s duties as a wife are consid-	128.6999969482422	261.296142578125	9.48004150390625	303.71067810058594	53
ered by them far more important than the state of her health. As a result, physi-	128.6999969482422	272.81622314453125	9.48004150390625	303.67942810058594	53
cal suffering caused by a series of illnesses “helps” the narrator to concentrate	128.6999969482422	284.3363037109375	9.48004150390625	303.6083526611328	53
on her personal experiences. Hülya starts to crystallize her attitude towards the	128.6999969482422	295.79669189453125	9.48004150390625	303.6509552001953	53
social environment and she slowly refuses to be a part of a marriage of cultural	128.6999969482422	307.3167724609375	9.48004150390625	303.5723419189453	53
need. She defines it as a cultural pattern that has become empty for her. Thus,	128.6999969482422	318.83685302734375	9.48004150390625	303.64244079589844	53
Hülya does not describe the failure of her marriage in terms of a personal ex-	128.6999969482422	330.2972412109375	9.47998046875	303.52870178222656	53
perience (as she does in the case of her illness), such as lost feelings, missed	128.6999969482422	341.81732177734375	9.47998046875	303.4926300048828	53
hopes, unhappiness, but she does it in terms of belonging to two completely	128.6999969482422	353.33740234375	9.47998046875	303.5703582763672	53
different worlds. She is no longer part of the Turkish society as she had known	128.6999969482422	364.7977600097656	9.47998046875	303.6936492919922	53

Another important aspect influencing Hülya’s experiences is her mother’s	140.03997802734375	387.8379211425781	9.47998046875	292.3186340332031	53
role in organizing the marriage. Although the marriage was preplanned by both	128.6999969482422	399.29827880859375	9.47998046875	303.55332946777344	53
families, Hülya’s mother played a major role in this process. It is not clear to	128.6999969482422	410.818359375	9.47998046875	303.5562286376953	53
me to what extent the narrator’s mother was the one who supported her daugh-	128.70001220703125	422.33843994140625	9.47998046875	303.5391540527344	53
ter’s migration to Germany. Perhaps she was supporting her husband’s deci-	128.70001220703125	433.7987976074219	9.47998046875	303.59698486328125	53
sions. When Hülya left, her mother suffered from loneliness; she also saw her	128.70001220703125	445.3188781738281	9.47998046875	303.55438232421875	53
daughter’s miserable state of health. When Hülya got married her mother suf-	128.70001220703125	456.8389587402344	9.47998046875	303.60546875	53
fered by seeing her unhappy, but at the same time she could not accept that her	128.70001220703125	468.29931640625	9.47998046875	303.6974792480469	53
daughter would try to reorganize her life (for example, Hülya’s mother did not	128.70001220703125	479.81939697265625	9.47998046875	303.6340026855469	53
accept the divorce). Thus, the role of the narrator’s mother in her biography is	128.70001220703125	491.3394775390625	9.47998046875	303.6595153808594	53
ambivalent. On the one hand, there was a very strong positive emotional rela-	128.70001220703125	502.7998046875	9.47998046875	303.5657653808594	53
tionship between the mother and daughter but on the other hand it was, in fact,	128.70001220703125	514.3199462890625	9.47998046875	303.6585693359375	53
her mother who made Hülya accept the marriage which appeared to be a great	128.70001220703125	525.8399658203125	9.47998046875	303.6188049316406	53
misunderstanding. Nevertheless, Hülya tries to remain loyal to her mother and	128.70001220703125	537.3003540039062	9.47998046875	303.6197204589844	53
she uses various strategies in order not to blame her openly. For example,	128.70001220703125	548.8204345703125	9.47998046875	303.6273193359375	53
through the entire interview Hülya presents her mother as her most important	128.70001220703125	560.3405151367188	9.47998046875	303.6338806152344	53
significant other; she also stresses her mother’s suffering caused by her longing	128.70001220703125	571.8009033203125	9.47998046875	303.6424865722656	53
for her and then by problems in her (Hülya’s) marriage; moreover, when Hülya	128.70001220703125	583.3209228515625	9.480010986328125	303.62640380859375	53
says that her mother’s expectations forced her to accept, and then continue, the	128.6999969482422	594.841064453125	9.479995727539062	303.70787048339844	53

marriage for some time, she usually weakens the importance of this fact by	128.69961547851562	115.31494140625	9.48004150390625	303.54864501953125	55
pointing to others representing the same position, for example: “only my	128.69961547851562	126.83502197265625	9.48004150390625	303.47454833984375	55
mother and my parents/ well, actually I was a victim (Hadn’t been constrained)	128.69961547851562	138.29541015625	9.48004150390625	303.6747131347656	55
but my mother and my parents/ well actually I was a victim” (729-730). After	128.69961547851562	149.81549072265625	9.48004150390625	303.5002136230469	55
saying “my mother” she immediately adds “my parents” or she says, “our	128.69961547851562	161.3355712890625	9.48004150390625	303.59405517578125	55

ently. They only accept one reason for divorce, my mother or /eh/ Turkish	128.69961547851562	184.3160400390625	9.48004150390625	303.6681213378906	55
women” (718-719). From this perspective her mother represents collective	128.69961547851562	195.83612060546875	9.48004150390625	303.6433410644531	55
expectations and she is not the only person to be blamed.	128.69961547851562	207.2965087890625	9.48004150390625	216.59906005859375	55
Hülya decides to leave her husband in 1978, and gets divorced in 1980.	140.0395965576172	218.81658935546875	9.48004150390625	292.16590881347656	55
From field notes we learn that 1980 was also the year of her mother’s death,	128.69961547851562	230.336669921875	9.48004150390625	303.5561218261719	55
which she witnessed. The narrator does not speak about this in her story. I find	128.69961547851562	241.79705810546875	9.48004150390625	303.55615234375	55
two possible explanations of this fact. First, she does not want to reveal this	128.69961547851562	253.317138671875	9.48004150390625	303.6008605957031	55
traumatic experience in the interview situation and suppresses her mourning.	128.69961547851562	264.83721923828125	9.48004150390625	303.607421875	55
Second, she does not mention her mother’s death because of the constraints of	128.69961547851562	276.297607421875	9.48004150390625	303.5675048828125	55
story telling13, she should explain the coincidence of the date of her divorce	128.69961547851562	285.9815673828125	11.316162109375	303.6574401855469	55
with her mother’s death and this could cause the need for descriptions of mu-	128.70034790039062	299.33465576171875	9.48004150390625	303.6187744140625	55
tual relationships and her mother’s role in the unsuccessful design of Hülya’s	128.70034790039062	310.7950439453125	9.48004150390625	303.64154052734375	55
biography. This would be true especially since the narrator identifies herself as	128.70034790039062	322.31512451171875	9.480010986328125	303.6557312011719	55
the victim of this design: “I always sacrificed myself for other people” (731).	128.70034790039062	333.8352355957031	9.47998046875	293.3121643066406	55
Although Hülya cannot see any single advantage of her marriage (the only	140.0403289794922	345.29559326171875	9.47998046875	292.18492126464844	55
consequence was getting the status of a “divorced woman”), it is one of the	128.70034790039062	356.815673828125	9.47998046875	303.5258483886719	55
most important turning points in her identity change. She becomes aware of her	128.70034790039062	368.33575439453125	9.47998046875	303.5362854003906	55
independence and responsibility for her project of life. The history of Hülya’s	128.70034790039062	379.7961120605469	9.47998046875	303.69842529296875	55
marriage has become the first clear sign of her identity change. She starts it as a	128.70034790039062	391.3161926269531	9.47998046875	303.7097473144531	55
traditional Turkish woman—the daughter fulfilling expectations of her par-	128.70034790039062	402.8362731933594	9.47998046875	303.76287841796875	55
ents—but she quickly realizes that she is no longer the same person. The mar-	128.70034790039062	414.296630859375	9.47998046875	303.5960693359375	55
riage has become a misunderstanding because her project of life no longer	128.70034790039062	425.81671142578125	9.47998046875	303.5523986816406	55
corresponds with the stereotypical image of a Turkish woman. Thus, the year	128.70034790039062	437.3367919921875	9.47998046875	303.5040283203125	55
1980 is a symbolic cutting of the umbilical cord in the sense of the closest	128.70034790039062	448.7971496582031	9.47998046875	303.564697265625	55
family ties (that is her mother’s death) as well as social and cultural relation-	128.70034790039062	460.3172302246094	9.47998046875	303.58184814453125	55
ships with her home country—Hülya attains the status of a divorced woman	128.70034790039062	471.8373107910156	9.47998046875	303.5827331542969	55
which stigmatizes her in Turkish society. I think that from this moment on she	128.70034790039062	483.29766845703125	9.47998046875	303.5865173339844	55
stops considering Turkey as the country to which she would like to return.14	128.70034790039062	492.9815368652344	11.316192626953125	303.5996398925781	55
This supposition can be supported by the “German” line of Hülya’s biography.	128.70016479492188	506.334716796875	9.47998046875	299.904541015625	55
In 1978 the narrator applies for compensation.15 For the first time she de-	140.04014587402344	515.9615478515625	11.3134765625	292.18519592285156	55
cides to act in her own behalf in Germany. “I had to learn how to go the way,	128.7003936767578	529.314697265625	9.47998046875	303.75328063964844	55
13 According to SCHÜTZE there are three constraints to story telling: the constraint to close	128.6999969482422	559.883056640625	9.161041259765625	303.6907196044922	56
the form, to condense, and to go into details (cf. HERMANNS, 1987).	137.22010803222656	570.244384765625	7.980010986328125	224.74794006347656	56
14 Although in different parts of the narrative Hülya declares her readiness to go back one day,	128.6999969482422	578.2431640625	9.160964965820312	303.7002716064453	56
she also mentions frequently the reasons why she does not feel like returning.	137.22007751464844	588.6641845703125	7.9799957275390625	248.10780334472656	56
15 It is also the year when she definitely decides to leave her husband and she tells about	128.6999969482422	596.6632080078125	9.160903930664062	303.7401580810547	56
compensation in the next segment of the narrative (just after the story about her marriage).	137.22007751464844	607.0243530273438	7.9799957275390625	289.41868591308594	56

how to go to a labor court, how you (get) a lawyer /eh/ I said ‘I have to do all	128.69961547851562	115.31494140625	9.48004150390625	303.5315246582031	58
of this by myself. I have to get my experiences” (741-742). We may compare	128.69961547851562	126.83502197265625	9.48004150390625	303.5352478027344	58
this decision with her statement referring to the end of the first year in Ger-	128.69961547851562	138.29541015625	9.48004150390625	303.70880126953125	58
many: “Well, everyone of us got a permit of residence for three months, we	128.69961547851562	149.81549072265625	9.48004150390625	303.66900634765625	58
were glad ((she laughs)) and happy that /eh/ someone had done this for us”	128.69961547851562	161.3355712890625	9.48004150390625	303.5713195800781	58
(447-448). Learning to be independent is not an easy task. She receives com-	128.69961547851562	172.79595947265625	9.48004150390625	303.5770568847656	58
pensation but she does not achieve full success because, as she learns later, she	128.69961547851562	184.3160400390625	9.48004150390625	303.5125427246094	58
has chosen the wrong lawyer. Nevertheless, thanks to compensation she can	128.69961547851562	195.83612060546875	9.48004150390625	303.6064453125	58
start living on her own.	128.69961547851562	207.2965087890625	9.48004150390625	88.40478515625	58
At the same time Hülya loses her job and, in order to earn her living, she has	140.0395965576172	218.81658935546875	9.48004150390625	292.30824279785156	58
to accept a job in gastronomy, treating it as a temporary situation. This work is	128.69961547851562	230.336669921875	9.48004150390625	303.5846862792969	58
“A kind of work which I had never ((she laughs)) liked: In the gastronomy, in	128.69961547851562	241.79705810546875	9.48004150390625	303.6026916503906	58
the kitchen. At that time I didn’t want to be out of work any /eh/ longer. I said	128.69961547851562	253.317138671875	9.48004150390625	303.6244201660156	58
‘If you want to, you can do everything’. And later on when I find something	128.69961547851562	264.83721923828125	9.48004150390625	303.62066650390625	58
better I’d get another job” (792-793). Therefore, Hülya starts looking for a job	128.69960021972656	276.297607421875	9.48004150390625	303.7467498779297	58
she could and would like to do. The comparison of this attitude with the first	128.69960021972656	287.81768798828125	9.48004150390625	303.5011444091797	58
year of Hülya’s stay in Germany shows that now she gains the ability to act	128.69960021972656	299.3377685546875	9.48004150390625	303.5438995361328	58
intentionally and plan her life, even if she is aware of constraints on her situa-	128.69960021972656	310.79815673828125	9.48004150390625	303.5514678955078	58
tion.	128.69960021972656	322.3182373046875	9.480010986328125	17.154998779296875	58
In 1980 Hülya starts learning German. She decides to do it after eight years	140.03958129882812	333.8383483886719	9.47998046875	292.32806396484375	58
of being in Germany. This is another step of being independent and not at	128.69960021972656	345.2987060546875	9.47998046875	303.6017303466797	58
another’s mercy, such as in the first year of her stay when she could not com-	128.69960021972656	356.81878662109375	9.47998046875	303.4424285888672	58
municate with German superiors. Hülya gradually learns how to be independ-	128.69960021972656	368.3388671875	9.47998046875	303.58558654785156	58
ent and what it means to be independent. She organizes her life and changes	128.69960021972656	379.7992248535156	9.47998046875	303.6291961669922	58
from a passive to an active person. This change refers to both the “Turkish”	128.69960021972656	391.3193054199219	9.47998046875	303.54579162597656	58
and the “German” line of her biography. Turkey remains her homeland,	128.69961547851562	402.8393859863281	9.47998046875	303.6159362792969	58
whereas she begins to treat Germany as the country where she prefers to live	128.69961547851562	414.29974365234375	9.47998046875	303.5087585449219	58
right now. The fact that she started learning German in 1980 is further proof	128.69961547851562	425.81982421875	9.47998046875	303.552490234375	58
that this year was a turning point in her biography. Hülya definitely changed	128.69961547851562	437.33990478515625	9.47998046875	303.6017150878906	58
her status in Turkey. We do not know if she decided at the same time to choose	128.69961547851562	448.8002624511719	9.47998046875	303.5969543457031	58
Germany as her country of residence. The idea of learning the language may	128.69961547851562	460.3203430175781	9.47998046875	303.6415100097656	58
support this supposition. Nevertheless, the knowledge of language enables her	128.69961547851562	471.8404235839844	9.47998046875	303.4946594238281	58
to change her status in Germany. She can no longer be considered a “working	128.69961547851562	483.30078125	9.47998046875	303.6510314941406	58

Hülya’s first eight years of migration are a time of fundamental changes in her	128.6999969482422	568.7344970703125	9.47998046875	303.51451110839844	60

narrator’s experiences as a migrant laborer. The first two years present a great	128.69961547851562	115.31494140625	9.48004150390625	303.53912353515625	63
shock for her, especially given her vulnerability as a seventeen year old girl.	128.69961547851562	126.83502197265625	9.48004150390625	303.6518859863281	63
Events of this time have made her more mature and experienced. Thus, during	128.69961547851562	138.29541015625	9.48004150390625	303.5846862792969	63
the next years the process of identity changes refers to her image of being an	128.69961547851562	149.81549072265625	9.48004150390625	303.5277099609375	63
adult person (woman). These changes began at the time of her migration, but	128.69961547851562	161.3355712890625	9.48004150390625	303.5685119628906	63
Hülya gradually realizes that she is no longer the same person because she	128.69961547851562	172.79595947265625	9.48004150390625	303.4859924316406	63
cannot act in accordance with the earlier concept of her identity. She verifies	128.69961547851562	184.3160400390625	9.48004150390625	303.64910888671875	63
this conviction in the course of visits or vacations, her marriage, and her	128.69961547851562	195.83612060546875	9.48004150390625	303.5419616699219	63
mother’s death. All of these experiences make her realize that she has become	128.69961547851562	207.2965087890625	9.48004150390625	303.57421875	63
increasingly different from the expected model of a Turkish woman: “I am not	128.69961547851562	218.81658935546875	9.48004150390625	303.6309814453125	63
this ... good ... little mother of the family daughter of the family who has been	128.69961547851562	230.336669921875	9.48004150390625	303.62542724609375	63
influenced from infancy” (927-928). While living in Germany she learns how	128.69961547851562	241.79705810546875	9.48004150390625	303.59979248046875	63
to cope with problems on her own. She tastes independence: “I know more	128.69961547851562	253.317138671875	9.48004150390625	303.5591125488281	63
about the world” (927).	128.70016479492188	264.83465576171875	9.48004150390625	89.27694702148438	63
As I suggested, the experience of being different plays a crucial role in this	140.04014587402344	276.2950439453125	9.48004150390625	292.17933654785156	63
process. Hülya starts identifying herself as somebody who is different, at first	128.70016479492188	287.81512451171875	9.48004150390625	303.5543212890625	63
in her peer group, then in her Turkish environment, then in Turkish society, and	128.70016479492188	299.335205078125	9.48004150390625	303.62738037109375	63
finally in German society. I have already discussed the first two aspects of this	128.7001495361328	310.79559326171875	9.48004150390625	303.5496063232422	63
experience. Let me now turn to her attitude towards Turkish and German socie-	128.7001495361328	322.315673828125	9.480010986328125	303.5685272216797	63

The quoted self-commentary and other statements show that changes in her	140.04013061523438	345.296142578125	9.47998046875	292.1963806152344	63
identity are related to different images of women in Turkish and German socie-	128.7001495361328	356.81622314453125	9.47998046875	303.5572052001953	63
ties. According to Hülya, such values as being financially and morally inde-	128.7001495361328	368.3363037109375	9.47998046875	303.65003967285156	63
pendent and having your own life project are not accepted in the cultural pat-	128.7001495361328	379.7966613769531	9.47998046875	303.5978546142578	63
tern of being a woman in Turkish society. Therefore, Hülya describes changes	128.7001495361328	391.3167419433594	9.47998046875	303.6178436279297	63
in her identity using categories referring to men’s and women’s roles in both	128.7001495361328	402.8368225097656	9.47998046875	303.46046447753906	63
societies, and that is the main reason for feeling like an outsider in her country	128.7001495361328	414.29718017578125	9.47998046875	303.6736297607422	63
of origin. Fourteen years after her migration she neither identifies with Turkey	128.7001495361328	425.8172607421875	9.47998046875	303.6206512451172	63
as a country nor with the lifestyle of Turkish society. Hülya’s image of a	128.7001495361328	437.33734130859375	9.47998046875	303.5722198486328	63
woman is what motivates her own choices, especially her decision to live in	128.7001495361328	448.7976989746094	9.47998046875	303.6586456298828	63
Germany. Hülya concentrates on stressing contrasts to give a reasonable back-	128.7001495361328	460.3177795410156	9.47998046875	303.63206481933594	63
ground to the interpretation of her choices.	128.7001495361328	471.8378601074219	9.47998046875	162.27574157714844	63
The narrator has passed through all the stages of a migration process: great	140.04013061523438	483.2982177734375	9.47998046875	292.171630859375	63
plans for a better life (biographical action scheme), great disappointments when	128.7001495361328	494.81829833984375	9.47998046875	303.73731994628906	63
dreams clash with reality (trajectory—in her case intensified by illness), a	128.7001495361328	506.33837890625	9.47998046875	303.7079620361328	63
stabilization of biography (RIEMANN & SCHÜTZE, 1992). She has achieved	128.7001495361328	517.7987060546875	9.47998046875	303.54103088378906	63
her aim after many difficulties. But in her post-coda commentary Hülya charac-	128.7001495361328	529.31884765625	9.47998046875	303.7978973388672	63
terizes herself as an “empty” person. Why is she not satisfied? What is the	128.7001495361328	540.8388671875	9.47998046875	303.62074279785156	63
price for her independence? For sure, her chronic illness is one of the important	128.7001495361328	552.2992553710938	9.47998046875	303.6776580810547	63
experiences influencing her feelings. But first of all, the “emptiness” is con-	128.7001495361328	563.8193359375	9.47998046875	303.5590362548828	63
nected with the feeling of being a stranger both in Turkey and in Germany. She	128.7001495361328	575.3394165039062	9.47998046875	303.56187438964844	63
identifies with German society but her Turkish origins remain a stigma. Thus,	128.7001495361328	586.7998046875	9.480010986328125	303.6492156982422	63
Hülya gains the status of a marginal person in both societies.	128.7001495361328	598.3198852539062	9.479995727539062	230.92420959472656	63

The case of Hülya serves as a very good example of a marginal person—the	140.0395965576172	115.31494140625	9.48004150390625	292.20188903808594	65
concept introduced by PARK (1950) and STONEQUIST (1961). “The mar-	128.69961547851562	126.83502197265625	9.48004150390625	303.62451171875	65
ginal man is one whom fate has condemned to live in two societies and in two,	128.69961547851562	138.29541015625	9.48004150390625	303.64154052734375	65
not merely different but antagonistic cultures” (PARK, 1950, p.XV). Such a	128.69961547851562	149.81549072265625	9.48004150390625	303.62353515625	65
situation may occur as a result of migration.	128.69961547851562	161.3355712890625	9.48004150390625	167.2764892578125	65
Although Hülya is in a marginal position in both societies, her own interpre-	140.0395965576172	172.79595947265625	9.48004150390625	292.28541564941406	65
tation of this situation is different in the case of each country. The narrator does	128.69961547851562	184.3160400390625	9.48004150390625	303.6708984375	65
not accept the way in which Turkish society evaluates her status as a (divorced)	128.69961547851562	195.83612060546875	9.48004150390625	303.607421875	65
woman. Therefore, Hülya chooses the role of marginal person in Turkish soci-	128.69961547851562	207.2965087890625	9.48004150390625	303.5409851074219	65
ety. She distances herself from its values, and she is not up to date to what is	128.69961547851562	218.81658935546875	9.48004150390625	303.614990234375	65
going on in Turkish life, politics, economy etc. Whereas in Germany she is	128.69961547851562	230.336669921875	9.48004150390625	303.6813049316406	65
situated in a marginal position of not being accepted in German society because	128.69961547851562	241.79705810546875	9.48004150390625	303.7192687988281	65
of her being different. Hülya represents a minority which is “partially assimi-	128.69961547851562	253.317138671875	9.48004150390625	303.6311340332031	65
lated and psychologically identified with the dominant group without being	128.69961547851562	264.83721923828125	9.48004150390625	303.6044921875	65
fully accepted” (STONEQIUST 1961, p.121). STONEQUIST enumerates three	128.69961547851562	276.297607421875	9.48004150390625	303.566650390625	65
possibilities for a marginal person to develop his or her biography: “1) assimi-	128.69961547851562	287.81768798828125	9.48004150390625	303.55902099609375	65

tween the two groups” (p.130). In my opinion, Hülya represents the third type.	128.69961547851562	322.3182373046875	9.480010986328125	303.5325927734375	65
She is in-between two cultures. She has distanced herself from Turkish society	128.69961547851562	333.8383483886719	9.47998046875	303.59881591796875	65
and at the same time, being a Turk, she aspires to be a member of German	128.69961547851562	345.2987060546875	9.47998046875	303.572265625	65
society.	128.69961547851562	356.81878662109375	9.47998046875	29.252426147460938	65
The paradox of her case refers to the fact that (in terms of her present iden-	140.0395965576172	368.3388671875	9.47998046875	292.1545867919922	65
tity) she is no longer a Turkish woman, and she is also not an accepted German	128.69961547851562	379.7992248535156	9.47998046875	303.6092224121094	65
citizen although she wants to be a part of German society. That is why she talks	128.69961547851562	391.3193054199219	9.47998046875	303.7960510253906	65
about going back “one day.” But I think she will not because of the significant	128.69961547851562	402.8393859863281	9.47998046875	303.60076904296875	65
