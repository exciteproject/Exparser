The main goal of this article is to formulate a framework of the concept	144.5994873046875	226.06390380859375	10.98004150390625	323.1611633300781	13
of regional competitiveness. The “framework” of the concept implies, first	127.6200180053711	238.424072265625	10.98004150390625	340.0385208129883	13
and foremost, a number of general issues of regional competitiveness, which	127.62001037597656	250.78424072265625	10.98004150390625	340.1560516357422	13
should be specified in relation to a specific territory (a region or a group of	127.62002563476562	263.2037353515625	10.98004150390625	340.2284240722656	13

We will assume that a region is a relatively separate area with a set of	144.59622192382812	391.0010986328125	10.97998046875	323.1523132324219	13

creates an essential condition for giving a systemic definition and study of	127.62000274658203	175.48468017578125	10.98004150390625	340.1987533569336	18
the problem of competitiveness. Before we touch upon various types of	127.62000274658203	188.02496337890625	10.98004150390625	340.14168548583984	18
competition, it should be noted that the understanding of competition is also	127.6199951171875	200.56524658203125	10.98004150390625	340.1746520996094	18
varied. However, our task does not include a detailed analysis of the content	127.61997985839844	213.10552978515625	10.98004150390625	340.12852478027344	18
of competition and major consequences that the chosen definition implies.	127.61997985839844	225.64581298828125	10.98004150390625	340.07798767089844	18
We will focus on two approaches to defining competition: the static and	127.61997985839844	238.18609619140625	10.98004150390625	340.0879364013672	18
dynamic ones.	127.6199951171875	250.72637939453125	10.98004150390625	63.5137939453125	18
In accordance with the static approach, competition is a situation in	144.59947204589844	263.2301025390625	11.0166015625	323.1238250732422	18
which achievement of the goal by one subject is at the same time effec-	127.6199951171875	275.82965087890625	10.97998046875	340.0198669433594	18
tively limited by the competitor’s desire to achieve the same goal. To put	127.6199951171875	288.30950927734375	11.0166015625	340.2569885253906	18
it otherwise, the key feature of static competition is inaccessibility of the	127.6199951171875	300.8863525390625	10.98004150390625	340.2767639160156	18
same “benefit” for several subjects simultaneously. Though availability of	127.6199951171875	313.4266357421875	10.98004150390625	340.2229309082031	18
the same benefit for different subjects is possible if the benefit is public (one	127.62000274658203	325.9669189453125	10.97998046875	340.1252670288086	18
of the distinguishing features is absence of competition in consumption. For	127.6199951171875	338.50714111328125	10.980010986328125	340.2636413574219	18
example, the emergence of additional viewers of fireworks does not lead to	127.6199951171875	351.04742431640625	10.97998046875	340.20648193359375	18
inaccessibility of the fireworks as a spectacle for others2).	127.6199951171875	361.6398620605469	12.92779541015625	253.67123413085938	18
In accordance with the dynamic approach, competition is a process of	144.59976196289062	376.0887145996094	11.016571044921875	323.1128234863281	18

sources, as well as a process of using or creating new resources [4]. Since	127.62030029296875	401.228515625	11.016571044921875	340.21746826171875	18
the discovery of new opportunities is often associated with the use of infor-	127.62030029296875	413.80535888671875	10.97998046875	340.041748046875	18
mation and exchange of knowledge in society, competition can also be seen	127.62030029296875	426.3455810546875	10.980010986328125	340.19879150390625	18
as a process of identifying and sharing knowledge and information about	127.62028503417969	438.8858642578125	10.97998046875	340.2207794189453	18

Unless it is specified otherwise, in future we will use the term competi-	144.59976196289062	476.506591796875	10.980010986328125	323.08428955078125	18
tion in its static understanding, when dealing with the problem of competi-	127.62026977539062	489.046875	10.97998046875	340.125244140625	18
tiveness of the region without special emphasis on the composition and	127.62026977539062	501.5871276855469	10.980010986328125	340.1230163574219	18
change of structure of the political market at the regional level. We will only	127.62026977539062	514.1273803710938	10.97998046875	340.2076110839844	18
note that the functioning of the political market may lead to both widening	127.62026977539062	526.6676025390625	10.980010986328125	340.138427734375	18

cused on creating value rather than its redistribution or destruction. It does	127.62026977539062	551.7481689453125	10.980010986328125	340.29754638671875	18
not follow from what has been said that the dynamic approach to the defini-	127.62026977539062	564.2883911132812	10.97998046875	340.2197265625	18
tion of competition is inapplicable to the situation of interaction of economic	127.62026977539062	576.82861328125	10.980010986328125	340.1790466308594	18
agents on the goods and service market while determining competitiveness	127.62028503417969	589.368896484375	10.979995727539062	340.2086944580078	18
of the object under research.	127.62028503417969	601.9091796875	10.979995727539062	124.85906982421875	18
Forms of competition, in the static sense, are manifold. In particular, it is	144.59976196289062	614.5086669921875	10.979995727539062	323.1106262207031	18
well known that economic theory distinguishes between the following types	127.62029266357422	627.0489501953125	10.979995727539062	340.15494537353516	18
of competition: price and non-price competition, fair and unfair, current and	127.62029266357422	639.5892333984375	10.979995727539062	340.1537551879883	18
intertemporal, product and location, ex ante and ex post, for the market and	127.62029266357422	652.0986328125	11.010818481445312	340.1241226196289	18
in the market, as well as actual and potential ones.	127.62028503417969	664.669677734375	10.979995727539062	220.89781188964844	18
2 Strictly speaking, this benefit can be attributed to the «transferred» to public, when	127.62000274658203	695.4136962890625	11.807052612304688	340.2455368041992	19
after a certain point the marginal cost of providing this service begins growing.	127.6195297241211	708.720703125	10.019996643066406	316.3290481567383	19

Both the content of competition and competitive characteristics largely	144.60000610351562	124.84503173828125	10.98004150390625	323.1963806152344	22
depend on the properties of the product, which is the result of performance	127.62055969238281	137.2052001953125	10.98004150390625	340.1472625732422	22
of a corresponding subject, a party of competition. For example, if a product	127.62055969238281	149.62469482421875	10.98004150390625	340.3086395263672	22
(for example, a new computer programme) can easily cross the border but	127.62055969238281	161.98486328125	10.98004150390625	340.1504669189453	22
registering the very fact of its production in the country requires significant	127.62055969238281	174.40435791015625	10.98004150390625	340.2339630126953	22
costs, then other factors of regional competitiveness such as, for example,	127.62055969238281	186.7645263671875	10.98004150390625	340.1988067626953	22
quality of life of the product’s manufacturer will be of importance.	127.62055969238281	199.18402099609375	10.98004150390625	293.51515197753906	22
If we regard competition between economic agents in the market as a	144.60003662109375	211.544189453125	10.98004150390625	323.2138366699219	22
reference point and assume that the agents belong to the same market (in	127.62056732177734	223.90435791015625	10.98004150390625	340.20862579345703	22
terms of their product and geographic boundaries), which actually means	127.62056732177734	236.3238525390625	10.98004150390625	340.2438735961914	22
identical location, then this factor has no independent importance from the	127.62056732177734	248.68402099609375	10.98004150390625	340.2735366821289	22
point of view of competition. Weakening of this assumptions leads to the	127.62056732177734	261.103515625	10.98004150390625	340.08350372314453	22
following conclusions:	127.62056732177734	273.46368408203125	10.98004150390625	100.51531219482422	22
(1) location may affect the conditions of actual competition (and, conse-	144.60003662109375	285.8831787109375	10.98004150390625	323.0678405761719	22
quently, the competitiveness of the producer);	127.62054443359375	298.24334716796875	10.98004150390625	202.16043090820312	22
(2) location should be taken into account when assessing potential com-	144.6000213623047	310.603515625	10.98004150390625	323.20069885253906	22
petition and corresponding potential competitiveness.	127.62055969238281	323.02301025390625	10.97998046875	235.45399475097656	22
The second point is important in case the actors do not compete directly	144.60003662109375	335.3831787109375	10.980010986328125	323.0195007324219	22
as they work on different markets, but the parameters of their activities, as	127.62056732177734	347.80267333984375	10.97998046875	340.08011627197266	22
well as the results, are comparable. This mechanism is known as yardstick	127.62056732177734	360.162841796875	10.980010986328125	340.17569732666016	22
competition [5].	127.62055969238281	372.58233642578125	10.97998046875	70.85282897949219	22
Economic activity in general and entrepreneurship in particular, occur at	144.60003662109375	384.9425048828125	10.980010986328125	323.1820068359375	22

tity can not be located in different areas, or in other words, when the same	127.61947631835938	409.72216796875	10.980010986328125	340.0824279785156	22
legal entity is registered in different regions and can not simultaneously	127.61947631835938	422.0823974609375	10.97998046875	340.0758361816406	22
carry out the same activity in different regions, is very important because it	127.61947631835938	434.5018310546875	10.980010986328125	340.06158447265625	22
is a basis of location-based competition.	127.61947631835938	446.862060546875	10.97998046875	176.51666259765625	22
In its pure form, location-based competition will operate as follows.	144.5989532470703	459.22222900390625	10.980010986328125	323.0425567626953	22
Let’s assume that there are some isolated areas among which there are some	127.6194839477539	471.6417236328125	10.97998046875	340.19445037841797	22
randomly distributed economic unit creating a certain value. Each economic	127.6194839477539	484.00189208984375	10.980010986328125	340.1877975463867	22
unit is the centre of decision-making, and the decisions reflect the interests	127.6194839477539	496.42138671875	10.97998046875	340.06700897216797	22
of the entity controlling the unit.	127.6194839477539	508.7815856933594	10.980010986328125	143.0276107788086	22
If the terms of interaction with other economic units and between this	144.5989532470703	521.2010498046875	10.97998046875	323.2467803955078	22
unit and the entity in control of the territory are less favourable than else-	127.61837768554688	533.561279296875	10.980010986328125	340.0505676269531	22
where, then for the decision maker in the given economic unit there emerge	127.61839294433594	545.9214477539062	10.97998046875	340.14723205566406	22
incentives for the relocation of its economic activity to another territory. All	127.61839294433594	558.3409423828125	10.980010986328125	340.1966094970703	22
other things being equal, ceteris paribus, the more favourable the conditions	127.61839294433594	570.6702880859375	11.01080322265625	340.10325622558594	22
of entrepreneurial activity in the region, the more entrepreneurs would run	127.61837768554688	583.12060546875	10.979995727539062	340.1758117675781	22
their business in the region. Moreover, it is important to note that this is not	127.61839294433594	595.4807739257812	10.979995727539062	340.0736846923828	22

gion to another. Competition can also take place indirectly when business	127.61839294433594	620.2604370117188	10.979995727539062	340.14170837402344	22

It is clear that for effective location-based competition, many conditions	144.59947204589844	149.7454833984375	10.98004150390625	323.22593688964844	26
must be fulfilled. But the most important one is that the expected net profit	127.62000274658203	162.2857666015625	10.98004150390625	340.18566131591797	26

count) must not be less than the cost of business transfer, that is, the costs to	127.62000274658203	187.3663330078125	10.98004150390625	340.0352096557617	26

The costs of business transfer are crucial to ensure the effectiveness of	144.59947204589844	224.9871826171875	10.98004150390625	323.1216278076172	26

depends largely on the development level of the markets infrastructure, in-	127.61892700195312	262.6080322265625	10.98004150390625	340.17791748046875	26

this is a small and medium size business, which practically does not use	127.61892700195312	287.6885986328125	10.98004150390625	340.1285400390625	26

The functioning of infrastructure markets involves a physical movement of	127.61892700195312	312.82843017578125	10.98004150390625	340.068115234375	26

In addition, consideration should be given to two more options for a	144.598388671875	350.44921875	10.97998046875	323.16558837890625	26

gether. In this case, the region's competitiveness as such should be separated	127.618896484375	375.52972412109375	10.97998046875	340.0780029296875	26
from the competitiveness of formal institutions, regulating the activities of	127.618896484375	388.0699462890625	10.980010986328125	340.14501953125	26
economic agents, and the competitiveness of similar institutions that regulate	127.618896484375	400.6102294921875	10.97998046875	340.17578125	26

We would also like to emphasize that at the categorial level, there should	144.598388671875	438.23095703125	10.980010986328125	323.1962890625	26
be a distinction between attractiveness (competitiveness) of the region for	127.6189193725586	450.771240234375	10.97998046875	340.15055084228516	26
entrepreneurship and that for living (free time consumption). The better the	127.61892700195312	463.31146240234375	10.980010986328125	340.1471862792969	26

Understanding the notion of the competitiveness of the territory is	144.60000610351562	555.5853271484375	10.980010986328125	323.0875549316406	28
largely dependent on the context it is used in. Obviously, while studying	127.61944580078125	568.1255493164062	10.97998046875	340.1505126953125	28
interregional links, first and foremost, there emerges a thesis of international,	127.61944580078125	580.665771484375	10.980010986328125	340.16693115234375	28
interregional and, in general, inter-territorial trade. From this perspective, the	127.61944580078125	593.2060546875	10.979995727539062	340.1395263671875	28
fundamental rationale behind the direction of the movement of goods and,	127.61944580078125	605.746337890625	10.979995727539062	340.2043151855469	28
respectively, specialization is comparative advantages resulting from differ-	127.61944580078125	618.2865600585938	10.979995727539062	340.1494445800781	28
ent opportunities, alternative costs of goods production on these territories.	127.61944580078125	630.8267822265625	10.979995727539062	329.6997375488281	28
For all the complexity of modern theory of international trade, the basic	144.59890747070312	643.3670654296875	10.979995727539062	323.2072448730469	28
idea is simple. Territories (countries, regions) can, technically speaking,	127.61943817138672	655.9073486328125	10.979995727539062	340.22733306884766	28
produce the same (or quite intersecting) set of goods. However, an increase	127.61943817138672	668.4475708007812	10.979995727539062	340.13626861572266	28
in the volume of production of the same product will be directly related to	127.61944580078125	680.98779296875	10.979995727539062	340.1658630371094	28

However, one should take into account two important considerations	144.60000610351562	124.96502685546875	10.98004150390625	323.1809387207031	31
which are crucial for understanding the content of the region's competitive-	127.62054443359375	137.50531005859375	10.98004150390625	340.0967102050781	31
ness and conditions for its raising.	127.62054443359375	150.04559326171875	10.98004150390625	150.3656005859375	31
Firstly, in the theoretical models comparative advantages are initial con-	144.6000213623047	162.58587646484375	10.98004150390625	323.1545867919922	31
ditions for explaining the direction and scale of trade between territories.	127.62055206298828	175.12615966796875	10.98004150390625	340.1691207885742	31
However, in practice, identification of these comparative advantages in a	127.62055206298828	187.66644287109375	10.98004150390625	340.0802230834961	31
complex, diversified economy is a separate issue. Accordingly, the more	127.62055206298828	200.20672607421875	10.98004150390625	340.14608001708984	31
precise the mechanism with the help of which the comparative advantage is	127.62055206298828	212.74700927734375	10.98004150390625	340.08238983154297	31
revealed, the higher the competitiveness of the territory is. However, one	127.62054443359375	225.28729248046875	10.98004150390625	340.1395263671875	31
should admit that in bilateral trade, inadequacy in identifying the compara-	127.62052917480469	237.8868408203125	10.98004150390625	340.0352020263672	31
tive advantage may have a negative impact on trade partners.	127.62052917480469	250.4271240234375	10.98004150390625	268.74537658691406	31
Secondly, one can imagine a fairly unique, but yet an important case	144.60000610351562	262.9674072265625	10.98004150390625	323.2665710449219	31
when two countries' alternative costs of production of a fixed set of goods	127.62053680419922	275.5076904296875	10.98004150390625	340.1307144165039	31
are the same. The differences are only in the direct costs associated with	127.62053680419922	288.0479736328125	10.98004150390625	340.1197280883789	31
productivity factors. Does this mean that the two countries (or two regions)	127.62052917480469	300.5882568359375	10.98004150390625	340.1186065673828	31
are equally competitive? It is clear that substantial differences in productiv-	127.62052917480469	313.1285400390625	10.98004150390625	340.2701873779297	31
ity come from the characteristics of the regions, for example, from the regu-	127.62052917480469	325.6688232421875	10.97998046875	340.1175079345703	31
latory regime.	127.62052917480469	338.20904541015625	10.980010986328125	61.68891906738281	31
Competitiveness is a relative (comparative) characteristic of the sub-	144.60000610351562	350.77203369140625	10.980010986328125	323.08306884765625	31
ject of actual or potential competition, regardless of the characteristics of	127.62053680419922	363.25189208984375	11.016571044921875	340.1307144165039	31
competition. As can be seen from the previous statement, it is necessary to	127.62052917480469	375.8287353515625	10.97998046875	340.2163848876953	31
distinguish between competitiveness of an individual business entity (indus-	127.62054443359375	388.36895751953125	10.980010986328125	340.1449890136719	31
try) and the region's competitiveness. In terms of the market functioning	127.62052917480469	400.90924072265625	10.97998046875	340.10765075683594	31
scheme, competitiveness of the region derives from the competitiveness of	127.62051391601562	413.449462890625	10.980010986328125	340.0999755859375	31
its enterprises. The higher (lower) the competitiveness of enterprises, other	127.62049865722656	425.98974609375	10.97998046875	340.1735382080078	31
things being equal, the higher (lower) the region's competitiveness is. In its	127.62049865722656	438.52996826171875	10.980010986328125	340.0978240966797	31
turn, in the first approximation, competitiveness of an enterprise is expressed	127.6204833984375	451.07025146484375	10.97998046875	340.1142578125	31
in terms of how efficiently the production factors are used and what the	127.6204833984375	463.6697998046875	10.97998046875	340.1372985839844	31
prices of these factors are. However, it should be born in mind that compa-	127.6204833984375	476.21002197265625	10.980010986328125	340.0078430175781	31
nies may belong to different sectors of economy; they may be different in	127.6204833984375	488.75030517578125	10.97998046875	340.1899719238281	31
size, and in their organizational and legal forms. That is why, the specified	127.6204833984375	501.2904968261719	10.980010986328125	340.1164855957031	31
ratio is more complex in its character.	127.6204833984375	513.830810546875	10.97998046875	166.44696044921875	31
In addition, there is no uniform understanding of the competitiveness of	144.59996032714844	526.4303588867188	10.97998046875	323.0469512939453	31
a separate business, industry or national economy in economic literature. In	127.62049102783203	539.1506958007812	10.97998046875	340.16146087646484	31

Competitive location, in the first approximation, actually means that the	144.5977783203125	370.42974853515625	10.97998046875	323.16339111328125	35
region is competitive; it can be viewed through the prism of contractual rela-	127.6183090209961	383.33013916015625	10.97998046875	340.0429153442383	35

does not mean that such a contract must exist explicitly. Typically, there is a	127.61831665039062	409.190185546875	10.980010986328125	340.20758056640625	35
hidden, implicit contract, which, however, can be reconstructed with the help	127.61830139160156	422.090576171875	10.980010986328125	340.3634796142578	35

Furthermore, this reliability consists of at least two parts. The first relates	144.59779357910156	577.013916015625	10.980010986328125	323.2204132080078	35

such conditions, whereas the second is the reliability of commitments of the	127.61831665039062	602.8739624023438	10.979995727539062	340.2362060546875	35
authorities at a higher level, which, in terms of the classification factors of	127.61833190917969	615.7744140625	10.979995727539062	340.12205505371094	35
competitiveness, can be attributed to exogenous ones.	127.61833190917969	628.6748046875	10.979995727539062	236.4663848876953	35
However, as in any contractual relationship, the problems arising from	144.59780883789062	641.5751953125	10.979995727539062	323.1238098144531	35

Competitiveness of the region is closely intertwined with its economic	144.60000610351562	125.0250244140625	10.98004150390625	323.20721435546875	38

ing value, then economic development can be regarded as a consequence of	127.62055206298828	175.60430908203125	10.98004150390625	340.1120834350586	38
this kind of competition. Consequently, competitiveness and economic de-	127.62054443359375	188.26422119140625	10.98004150390625	340.1076965332031	38

A distinction should be drawn between economic development and eco-	144.6000213623047	213.58404541015625	10.98004150390625	323.37193298339844	38

feature of economic development. In other words, economic growth is only	127.61944580078125	251.50341796875	10.98004150390625	340.363525390625	38

Competitiveness, defined as survival of a business entity on the market,	144.6000518798828	314.74261474609375	10.98004150390625	323.14793395996094	38
is not linked explicitly to efficiency (at least in the short term perspective).	127.62059020996094	327.402587890625	10.97998046875	340.0801544189453	38
This may be due to the fact that business actors, competing with each other,	127.62057495117188	340.0625	10.980010986328125	340.1395263671875	38

Let us consider in more detail the relationship between competitiveness	144.60006713867188	365.322021484375	10.97998046875	323.1886291503906	38
and economic development. At first glance, the relationship between com-	127.62060546875	377.98193359375	10.980010986328125	340.1098937988281	38
petitiveness and economic development is simple and unambiguous: the	127.62060546875	390.64190673828125	10.97998046875	340.30535888671875	38
more competitive the region is, the faster its economic development and vice	127.62060546875	403.30181884765625	10.980010986328125	340.1626281738281	38

ness. However, when analyzing the relationship between the two phenom-	127.62062072753906	428.6217041015625	10.980010986328125	340.2053680419922	38
ena, a number of circumstances should be taken into account.	127.62062072753906	441.22125244140625	10.980010986328125	270.3781280517578	38
1. The definition of competitiveness, as a rule, implies a correlation of	144.60009765625	453.8812255859375	10.97998046875	323.1667175292969	38

relation of successive emerging states of the same object. One exception is	127.62062072753906	491.86102294921875	10.980010986328125	340.1197052001953	38
intertemporal competition, when a business entity actually competes with	127.62062072753906	504.4605407714844	10.980010986328125	340.15159606933594	38
itself by supplying the market with durable goods.	127.62062072753906	517.1205444335938	10.97998046875	221.2524871826172	38
2. It is also possible to define competitiveness of producers outside the	144.60009765625	529.780517578125	10.980010986328125	323.15234375	38
context of economic development as situations in which, according to J.	127.6206283569336	542.4404296875	10.97998046875	340.1625747680664	38

of economic development. It is clear that this is only a theoretical abstraction	127.62063598632812	567.7603149414062	10.97998046875	340.20977783203125	38
which shows that one phenomenon (competitiveness) is not identical to the	127.62063598632812	580.35986328125	10.97998046875	340.2240905761719	38
other (economic development).	127.62063598632812	593.019775390625	10.979995727539062	137.71774291992188	38
3. However, an increase of competitiveness is related in an even more	144.60011291503906	605.6797485351562	10.979995727539062	323.1392059326172	38
complex way with economic development, because the way how to raise	127.62062072753906	618.3397216796875	10.979995727539062	340.15928649902344	38
competitiveness is of great significance. If it involves the creation of incen-	127.62062072753906	630.9996337890625	10.979995727539062	340.1470489501953	38
tives for economic agents to seek new ways of productive and efficient use	127.62062072753906	643.5991821289062	10.979995727539062	340.1350860595703	38
of the existing limited resources, and/or discover new resources, in this case	127.62062072753906	656.2591552734375	10.979995727539062	340.0099639892578	38
the factors enhancing competitiveness also act as economic development	127.62062072753906	668.9190673828125	10.979995727539062	340.2031707763672	38
factors. But if an increase of competitiveness of business entities, as well as	127.62060546875	681.5789794921875	10.979995727539062	340.103271484375	38
territories, is due to the industrial policy, resulting in a meaningful redistri-	127.62060546875	694.2389526367188	10.979995727539062	340.17242431640625	38
bution of scarce resources in favour of certain categories of industries or	127.62060546875	706.89892578125	10.980003356933594	340.1219177246094	38

The main conclusion is that the content of economic development of the	144.5994873046875	162.5853271484375	10.98004150390625	323.32476806640625	41
region, considered in the context of competition between regions in the field	127.618896484375	174.705078125	10.98004150390625	340.18780517578125	41
of business development and focused on creating value, and the content of	127.618896484375	186.88519287109375	10.98004150390625	340.1845397949219	41

If competitiveness of the region is a relative characteristic of a territory,	144.60000610351562	256.06475830078125	10.98004150390625	323.0996398925781	43

specified characteristics of the region will be defined as factors of competi-	127.61941528320312	292.42401123046875	10.98004150390625	340.13623046875	43

Taking into account a close interconnection and, at the same time, some	144.59889221191406	316.66351318359375	10.98004150390625	323.1457977294922	43

petitiveness of the region, it should be noted that the relation between them,	127.61941528320312	340.9029541015625	10.980010986328125	340.1241455078125	43
described in the previous section, is reflected in the factors of economic de-	127.61941528320312	353.022705078125	10.97998046875	340.0802307128906	43
velopment and competitiveness, respectively.	127.61941528320312	365.14239501953125	10.980010986328125	200.14889526367188	43
The classification of economic development factors of the region was	144.59889221191406	377.26214599609375	10.97998046875	323.1666717529297	43
carried out by L. A. Grigoriev and Y. Urozhaeva [2]. In accordance with	127.61942291259766	389.3818359375	10.980010986328125	340.10326385498047	43
their classification, three groups of factors are identified: “natural” (objec-	127.61942291259766	401.5015869140625	10.97998046875	340.1581344604492	43
tive), factors external to the region and institutional ones. Accepting the ba-	127.61942291259766	413.62127685546875	10.980010986328125	340.17906951904297	43
sis of the proposed classification, we would like to point out, however, that	127.61942291259766	425.74102783203125	10.97998046875	340.1296615600586	43
the above mentioned classification does not meet the requirements of the	127.61943054199219	437.8607177734375	10.980010986328125	340.14613342285156	43
theoretical classification, since the classification grounds are not clearly de-	127.61943054199219	449.98046875	10.97998046875	340.1493682861328	43
fined and many factors within the groups may partly overlap. This fact will	127.61943054199219	462.16058349609375	10.97998046875	340.19224548339844	43
be taken into account in the further discussion of the issue of the factors of	127.61943054199219	474.2802734375	10.980010986328125	340.13075256347656	43
the competitiveness of the region. Since the region’s competitiveness (its	127.61943054199219	486.4000244140625	10.97998046875	340.08460998535156	43
increase or sustaining its high level) is the goal of socio-economic policies,	127.61944580078125	498.51971435546875	10.980010986328125	340.0978088378906	43
there is also a practical question of how this goal can be achieved.	127.61944580078125	510.63946533203125	10.97998046875	290.519775390625	43
We can formulate several working criteria for a classification of the fac-	144.5989227294922	522.7591552734375	10.980010986328125	323.11280822753906	43

(1) the significance of the factor;	144.5989227294922	546.9986572265625	10.980010986328125	147.33509826660156	43
(2) the dependence of the factor on decisions taken by actors in the	144.5989227294922	559.1183471679688	10.97998046875	323.17982482910156	43
socio-economic policies in the region;	127.61944580078125	571.238037109375	10.980010986328125	168.1180419921875	43
(3) duration of the factor (short, medium and long term ones).	144.5989227294922	583.3577880859375	10.97998046875	274.79322814941406	43
The following sections focus on the exogenous and endogenous factors	144.5989227294922	595.4775390625	10.979995727539062	323.13478088378906	43
of competitiveness, i. e. factors of the second group. That is why, in this	127.61945343017578	607.5972290039062	10.979995727539062	340.2361068725586	43
section we will briefly comment on two other groups as well. In terms of	127.61945343017578	619.7169189453125	10.979995727539062	340.1076889038086	43
their impact on the level of competitiveness, the factors are not equal. For	127.61946105957031	631.836669921875	10.979995727539062	340.0462188720703	43
example, if one considers the change in GDP as a reflection of entrepreneu-	127.61947631835938	643.9564208984375	10.979995727539062	340.147216796875	43

At the same time, the number of IBGs whose interests are represented in	144.5972900390625	433.1822509765625	10.980010986328125	323.1490173339844	47
the region can be an important factor, just as important as the location of the	127.6178207397461	445.54248046875	10.97998046875	340.2108840942383	47

Another group of exogenous factors is associated with the state of key	144.5972900390625	507.4620056152344	10.980010986328125	323.04364013671875	47

competitiveness, make a decision. This is due to the fact that the history of	127.6178207397461	532.24169921875	10.980010986328125	340.13294219970703	47
the region is important; it makes an impact on the competitiveness of differ-	127.61782836914062	544.6018676757812	10.97998046875	340.0835266113281	47
ent forms of accumulated capital — human, physical and social, if the latter	127.61782836914062	557.0213623046875	10.980010986328125	340.17572021484375	47

Finally, another group of factors involves changes which are exogenous	144.59730529785156	581.801025390625	10.979995727539062	323.14683532714844	47

In particular, we are speaking about changes in the world commodity mar-	144.59732055664062	618.9408569335938	10.979995727539062	323.25994873046875	47

However, it should be understood that within a fairly narrow food segment	144.5973358154297	668.5001831054688	10.979995727539062	323.3665313720703	47

could have the opposite effect on the competitiveness of a region.	127.61782836914062	705.6400146484375	10.980003356933594	275.836181640625	47

Thus, exogenous factors include:	144.60000610351562	125.0250244140625	10.98004150390625	145.4388427734375	50

All the factors listed above are not exogenous by definition if, for example, a	144.6000213623047	238.843505859375	10.98004150390625	323.50941467285156	50

Endogenous factors are such factors of regional competitiveness, the	144.60113525390625	276.84710693359375	10.97998046875	323.1347961425781	50

which economic agents have to pay for services provided by the regional	127.62167358398438	340.06256103515625	10.980010986328125	340.2679443359375	50
authorities (institutional infrastructure, real infrastructure) and the quality of	127.62167358398438	352.7225341796875	10.97998046875	340.280029296875	50

ness of the region, which, nevertheless, can be outweighed by other factors;	127.62167358398438	390.6419677734375	10.97998046875	340.18341064453125	50
firstly, due to poor quality of services, especially public benefits, and sec-	127.62167358398438	403.3018798828125	10.980010986328125	340.249267578125	50
ondly, due to diminishing competitiveness in the future (a decrease in re-	127.62167358398438	415.96185302734375	10.97998046875	340.0110778808594	50

There is another aspect of the influence of socio-economic policies on the	144.6011505126953	441.2213134765625	10.980010986328125	323.39381408691406	50

aims at creating incentives for economic agents in terms of generating in-	127.6217041015625	491.8849182128906	10.980010986328125	340.3711853027344	50

Strictly speaking, the establishment of formal institutions is the only	147.3626708984375	529.780517578125	10.980010986328125	320.41943359375	50

In accordance with the approach proposed by Yassin and Yakovleva [7,	144.60227966308594	618.3397216796875	10.979995727539062	323.06996154785156	50

In accordance with the existing standard approaches used to quantify	144.59671020507812	435.2225341796875	10.97998046875	323.0766296386719	55
competitiveness, one can single out the following indicators: (1) productivity	127.61723327636719	447.34222412109375	10.980010986328125	340.13291931152344	55

If the theory of international trade is taken as a starting point, then the	144.59671020507812	483.701416015625	10.97998046875	323.17877197265625	55
key indicator is associated with the comparative advantages of the country	127.61724090576172	495.82110595703125	10.980010986328125	340.0681838989258	55
(region). In research, the coefficient of identified comparative advantages is	127.61724090576172	507.94085693359375	10.97998046875	340.1581497192383	55
used; it is calculated as the ratio of the share of the country (region) in the	127.61723327636719	520.060546875	10.980010986328125	340.1811981201172	55

Mathematically, this coefficient can be represented as follows [8]:	144.59971618652344	556.4248046875	10.980010986328125	290.94468688964844	55

where RCAi is the coefficient of the identified comparative advantages	127.62130737304688	605.684326171875	10.979995727539062	340.1878662109375	57
which, theoretically, can change from -100 to 100, Xi/ΣXi is the country’s	127.62132263183594	617.9913330078125	11.573379516601562	340.15269470214844	57

It should be noted at once that this indicator is not practicable for regions	144.60299682617188	643.6641845703125	10.979995727539062	323.3554992675781	57

tion of non-operating SMEs), actually reflecting the intensity of the business	127.62054443359375	161.0242919921875	10.98004150390625	340.1219482421875	61

The greater the number of SMEs per capita, given all other conditions	144.60003662109375	185.2637939453125	10.98004150390625	323.3039245605469	61
being equal, the more competitive the region is. In this thesis, the principle	127.62059020996094	197.383544921875	10.98004150390625	340.19334411621094	61
of “other conditions being equal” is essential. It is clear that “traces” of re-	127.62059020996094	209.5032958984375	10.98004150390625	340.1724395751953	61
gional competitiveness can also be found in retrospect if we assume that the	127.62059020996094	221.623046875	10.98004150390625	340.16697692871094	61
dynamics of key indicators is the result of location-based competition. This	127.62057495117188	233.7427978515625	10.98004150390625	340.1658935546875	61
applies, above all, to such indicators as GRP, including GDP per capita,	127.62057495117188	245.862548828125	10.98004150390625	340.1615295410156	61
current investments and others.	127.62057495117188	257.9822998046875	10.98004150390625	137.48165893554688	61
Among the most obvious indicators of competitiveness to be applied is	147.36041259765625	270.10205078125	10.98004150390625	320.4874267578125	61
the amount of added value per worker. As the impact of economic activity is	127.6205825805664	282.2218017578125	10.98004150390625	340.2262496948242	61
estimated through added value, thus the more value is added in the region,	127.62059020996094	294.341552734375	10.98004150390625	340.2163848876953	61
ceteris paribus, the more competitive the business operating in the region is,	127.62059020996094	306.43048095703125	11.0108642578125	340.1143035888672	61
and, consequently, the more competitive the region is (if one uses the logic	127.62059783935547	318.5810546875	10.98004150390625	340.2097854614258	61
of competition by location in association with the region's competitiveness	127.62059020996094	330.76116943359375	10.980010986328125	340.09230041503906	61
on the one hand, and the correlation between the region's competitiveness	127.62059020996094	342.88092041015625	10.97998046875	340.14720153808594	61
and competitiveness of the region's products, manufactured in the territory,	127.62059020996094	355.0006103515625	10.980010986328125	340.0999298095703	61
on the other). However, in most cases data on added value is not available.	127.62059020996094	367.120361328125	10.97998046875	328.7455596923828	61
Generalized indicator of competitiveness is the one that takes into	144.60006713867188	379.2638854980469	10.980010986328125	323.08099365234375	61
account all major aspects of competitiveness. The generalized indicator of	127.61949157714844	391.3243103027344	11.016571044921875	340.13404846191406	61
competitiveness is unlikely to have any dimension: it is, probably, a numeral	127.61949157714844	403.4805908203125	10.980010986328125	340.04185485839844	61
as is, for example, the indicator of elasticity. Approaches to the calculation	127.6195068359375	415.600341796875	10.97998046875	340.22625732421875	61
mechanism of this numeral may be different.	127.6195068359375	427.72003173828125	10.980010986328125	197.61801147460938	61
1. One option: one can calculate the average fraction for the entire set of	144.59898376464844	439.83978271484375	10.97998046875	323.1622772216797	61
major factors affecting competitiveness, assessing the significance and role	127.6195068359375	451.95947265625	10.980010986328125	340.1548767089844	61
of each factor. If the value of this indicator for a particular region is above	127.6195068359375	464.0792236328125	10.97998046875	340.18133544921875	61
average, then the region is competitive.	127.6195068359375	476.19891357421875	10.980010986328125	173.12823486328125	61
2. Another option: choosing, as a starting point, the best value for the en-	144.59898376464844	488.31866455078125	10.97998046875	323.16334533691406	61
tire set and comparing it with specific values obtained for the region. In this	127.6195068359375	500.4383544921875	10.980010986328125	340.2712707519531	61
case the value can not be greater than one (1), although it is possible that this	127.6195068359375	512.55810546875	10.97998046875	340.1790771484375	61
value will be equal to 1 (for the leader region).	127.6195068359375	524.6778564453125	10.980010986328125	205.38967895507812	61
3. The third option: the reference point is maximum possible values of	144.59898376464844	536.7975463867188	10.97998046875	323.19081115722656	61
the indicators, whereas the actual values for each region indicate deviations	127.6195068359375	548.917236328125	10.980010986328125	340.1373291015625	61
due to the untapped reserves. In this case, the standard value would be less	127.6195068359375	561.0369873046875	10.97998046875	340.0945129394531	61
than one (1) for all regions (including the leader region).	127.6195068359375	573.15673828125	10.980010986328125	248.705810546875	61
Among important indicators and characteristics of the region (which are	144.59898376464844	585.2764282226562	10.97998046875	323.35984802246094	61
related to its competitiveness, but do not exhaust its full content, though they	127.61951446533203	597.3961181640625	10.979995727539062	340.1461410522461	61
are used as stand-alone characteristics of this region), one can point out in-	127.61952209472656	609.515869140625	10.979995727539062	340.1944122314453	61
vestment attractiveness of the region and the regional budgets reflected in	127.61953735351562	621.6356201171875	10.979995727539062	340.0813293457031	61
the ratings of paying capacity.	127.61953735351562	633.7553100585938	10.979995727539062	132.92715454101562	61
In the comparative assessment of any region, various kinds of ratings are often	144.59901428222656	645.875	10.979995727539062	323.5377960205078	61
used as they can help sort out the regions according to the established criteria.	127.61845397949219	657.9947509765625	10.979995727539062	318.6802215576172	61
It should be noted that investment attractiveness ratings may indicate the	144.59791564941406	670.114501953125	10.979995727539062	323.2094268798828	61
specialization of the region, if we assume that in the world markets there are	127.61844635009766	682.2341918945312	10.979995727539062	340.0769577026367	61
relatively stable favourable conditions for goods that are consistent with the	127.61843872070312	694.3538818359375	10.979995727539062	340.1889343261719	61
specialization of the region. That is why, there can be a positive correlation	127.61845397949219	706.4736328125	10.980003356933594	340.15052795410156	61

between the level of investment attractiveness and competitiveness of the	127.62000274658203	124.6650390625	10.98004150390625	340.17464447021484	64
region but it is not as strong as it may seem at first glance.	127.62000274658203	136.7847900390625	10.98004150390625	256.0437545776367	64
As the region is the subject of location-based competition, the state of	144.59947204589844	148.904541015625	10.98004150390625	323.1029510498047	64
the regional budget is very important, because it reflects not only the current	127.61891174316406	161.0242919921875	10.98004150390625	340.11643981933594	64
but also future regime of entrepreneurial activity in the region. Indeed, if the	127.61891174316406	173.14404296875	10.98004150390625	340.15379333496094	64
budget of the region is made with a significant deficit, and is financed	127.61891174316406	185.2637939453125	10.98004150390625	340.0802459716797	64

Understanding the content of competitiveness in positive terms is of	144.60000610351562	295.124755859375	10.98004150390625	323.1402587890625	67
great importance for the development of socio-economic policies, both at the	127.62053680419922	307.2445068359375	10.98004150390625	340.32508087158203	67
level of economy as a whole and at the level of the region, given a set of	127.62053680419922	319.3642578125	10.980010986328125	340.1187210083008	67
exogenous and endogenous factors (variables). Interdependence of various	127.62053680419922	331.4840087890625	10.97998046875	340.28336334228516	67

tant aspects, two of which we will pay special attention to.	127.62052917480469	355.7838134765625	10.980010986328125	257.4249725341797	67
There are three groups of tools, which can affect competitiveness of the re-	144.60000610351562	367.903564453125	10.97998046875	323.4400634765625	67

1. General measures to strengthen the regional economy and its position	144.59890747070312	392.14300537109375	10.97998046875	323.1875	67

petitiveness of firms and their products. Such measures shall provide the	127.61943054199219	416.3824462890625	10.97998046875	340.1121063232422	67
basis for competitiveness for national economy and that of the region. These	127.61943054199219	428.50213623046875	10.980010986328125	340.2471466064453	67
general measures include, first and foremost, institutional framework for	127.61943054199219	440.62188720703125	10.97998046875	340.14064025878906	67

als, information support of export activities). For the regional government	127.62049865722656	501.2204284667969	10.980010986328125	340.15382385253906	67
this direction is less accessible than for the federal government (there is no	127.62049865722656	513.3402099609375	10.97998046875	340.1581573486328	67
way to exempt from import duties on raw materials), as well as it involves	127.6204833984375	525.4599609375	10.980010986328125	340.22625732421875	67
the risk of applying to them the norms of the federal law “On protection of	127.62046813964844	537.5796508789062	10.97998046875	340.16151428222656	67

These measures are not completely equivalent in terms of setting appro-	144.59996032714844	598.17822265625	10.979995727539062	323.1644744873047	67

conditions and in the conditions of a crisis. In this regard it should be noted	127.62049102783203	622.417724609375	10.979995727539062	340.1746139526367	67
that the region's competitiveness will largely depend on the balance of meas-	127.6204833984375	634.5374145507812	10.979995727539062	340.0692138671875	67

Given the fact that the competitiveness of the region derives from the	144.59994506835938	658.77685546875	10.979995727539062	323.1512756347656	67
competitiveness of products manufactured in its territory, identification of	127.62046813964844	670.8966064453125	10.979995727539062	340.1548614501953	67

proving the competitiveness of the industries is of vital importance. It is	127.62046813964844	695.135986328125	10.979995727539062	340.1098175048828	67

tries will be different. Moreover, it is understandable that it is rational to	127.62000274658203	124.6650390625	10.98004150390625	340.1505355834961	70

In this perspective there emerges a separate issue of a group of indus-	144.59945678710938	173.14404296875	10.98004150390625	323.09088134765625	70
tries, both in terms of potential impact of improving competitiveness and in	127.618896484375	185.2637939453125	10.98004150390625	340.208740234375	70
terms of tools that can be used to enhance this competitiveness.	127.618896484375	197.383544921875	10.98004150390625	278.84368896484375	70
Problems with the use of indicators of competitiveness in quality control	144.59835815429688	209.5032958984375	10.98004150390625	323.1578063964844	70
actually minimize the risk of manipulating them. Let's try to explain the es-	127.61888885498047	221.623046875	10.98004150390625	340.13404083251953	70
sence of the problem. Let’s assume that all players use the assumption that	127.61888885498047	233.7427978515625	10.98004150390625	340.07144927978516	70
the proposed indicators are adequate, in terms of comparative assessment of	127.61888885498047	245.862548828125	10.98004150390625	340.03736114501953	70
the region (its competitiveness).	127.61888885498047	257.9822998046875	10.98004150390625	141.07324981689453	70
If the welfare of a player depends on the level or the dynamics of this indica-	144.59835815429688	270.10205078125	10.98004150390625	323.2928771972656	70
tor, there is a stimulus for a corresponding change of the indicator. Moreover,	127.618896484375	282.2218017578125	10.98004150390625	340.34716796875	70
the actors will look for ways to achieve this goal with minimum expenditures.	127.61888122558594	294.341552734375	10.98004150390625	340.25917053222656	70
For example, if the dynamics of labour productivity is taken as a control indica-	127.61888122558594	306.4613037109375	10.98004150390625	340.41416931152344	70
tor, it might, other things being equal, encourage the use of labour-saving, capi-	127.61888122558594	318.5810546875	10.98004150390625	340.36695861816406	70
tal-intensive technologies. However, in the circumstances where a relatively	127.61888122558594	330.76116943359375	10.980010986328125	340.3711700439453	70
cheap labour is a competitive advantage, in terms of resources, the choice of this	127.61888122558594	342.88092041015625	10.97998046875	340.4096221923828	70
indicator may lead to reduced competitiveness (at least in some areas).	127.61888122558594	355.0006103515625	10.980010986328125	296.6103057861328	70
The assessment of competitiveness of the region involves a necessity to	144.5994415283203	367.120361328125	10.97998046875	323.11827087402344	70
take into account factors which are impossible or rather difficult to quantify.	127.61997985839844	379.24005126953125	10.980010986328125	336.1339874267578	70
This is especially true for factors that are actually very complicated, in	144.59945678710938	391.35980224609375	10.97998046875	323.1820373535156	70

mechanisms ensuring compliance with them.	127.6199951171875	427.71893310546875	10.980010986328125	198.27682495117188	70
In this respect, so as to solve this issue, it is necessary to pay more atten-	144.59947204589844	439.83868408203125	10.97998046875	323.15013122558594	70

of limited resources, paying special attention to the significance of each of	127.62001037597656	464.078125	10.97998046875	340.1735382080078	70

Understanding the above-mentioned issue will ensure more caution	147.35986328125	488.31756591796875	10.97998046875	320.423828125	70

region. That is why improving competitiveness of the region is an important	127.61941528320312	622.6043701171875	10.979995727539062	340.1263427734375	72

eas, to use the already known resources, as well as to identify unknown ex	127.62000274658203	124.63421630859375	11.0108642578125	340.15706634521484	75
ante resources of creating added value. This applies to business entities and	127.6199951171875	136.75396728515625	11.0108642578125	340.0648498535156	75

ronment in the territory. This approach is based on interdependence of the	127.62001037597656	161.0242919921875	10.98004150390625	340.11534118652344	75
notions “competition” and “competitiveness”.	127.62001037597656	173.14404296875	10.98004150390625	202.1989288330078	75
4. Competitiveness of the region depends on many factors which can be	144.5994873046875	185.22723388671875	11.0166015625	323.3170471191406	75
classified. In terms of decision-making process the most important groups	127.62001037597656	197.383544921875	10.98004150390625	340.2196502685547	75
are endogenous and exogenous factors of competitiveness.	127.62001037597656	209.5032958984375	10.98004150390625	258.0717315673828	75
5. In applied research a variety of techniques are used to assess competi-	144.59945678710938	221.58648681640625	11.0166015625	323.1271057128906	75

parative advantages and shortcomings. Among the most common are such	127.61997985839844	245.862548828125	10.98004150390625	340.0615692138672	75
indicators as a comparative advantage, productivity and cost of labour per	127.61997985839844	257.9822998046875	10.98004150390625	340.1933135986328	75
unit of output. The choice of methods for assessing competitiveness depends	127.61997985839844	270.10205078125	10.98004150390625	340.0967254638672	75
on the objective and accessible information. It should be born in mind that	127.61997985839844	282.2218017578125	10.98004150390625	340.2086639404297	75
available information is not always significant, and important information is	127.61997985839844	294.341552734375	10.98004150390625	340.2196502685547	75
not always available. The ideal method applicable to all cases of assessment	127.61997985839844	306.4613037109375	10.98004150390625	340.1526641845703	75
of competitiveness has not been identified yet.	127.61996459960938	318.5810546875	10.98004150390625	204.43655395507812	75
6. It is necessary to distinguish between competitiveness of manufactur-	144.6005401611328	330.724609375	11.016571044921875	323.22596740722656	75
ers in the industry and market. If competitiveness of manufacturers in the	127.62106323242188	342.88092041015625	10.97998046875	340.19000244140625	75
market is directly linked to the level of unit costs, competitiveness within the	127.62106323242188	355.0006103515625	10.980010986328125	340.2251281738281	75

zation which adequately reflects the manufacturer’s comparative advantage.	127.62107849121094	391.35980224609375	10.97998046875	340.0637969970703	75
In its turn competitiveness of the region implies not only the cost factor but	127.62107849121094	403.4794921875	10.980010986328125	340.1263885498047	75
also specific institutional conditions of production, which should lead to	127.62106323242188	415.5992431640625	10.97998046875	340.1713562011719	75
differentiation of the producer’s costs not only because of natural compara-	127.62107849121094	427.71893310546875	10.980010986328125	340.0066680908203	75
tive advantages or benefits in the organization, but because of differences in	127.62107849121094	439.83868408203125	10.97998046875	340.08021545410156	75
