1. ‘Let’s not waste a good crisis!’	113.4000015258789	245.2088623046875	10.97998046875	167.93575286865234	6
Without doubt, the context of responsible management education has changed over	113.39999389648438	260.2464599609375	10.97998046875	368.4459533691406	6
the last twelve months. Business schools1 are accused of being partly responsible for	113.40000915527344	272.24652099609375	10.98016357421875	368.48268127441406	6
the current economic crisis because they have failed to seriously integrate reflections	113.40046691894531	284.24676513671875	10.97998046875	368.49317932128906	6
on ethical values into their curricula (Holland 2009; Jacobs 2009). Of course, we could	113.40046691894531	296.246826171875	10.97998046875	368.5447235107422	6
lament more about the status of responsible management education (or rather the lack	113.40045166015625	308.24688720703125	10.97998046875	368.4997253417969	6
of much of a status). But why not take this crisis as an opportunity to lead change?	113.40045166015625	320.2469482421875	10.97998046875	368.44366455078125	6
Why not look into the future and use this crisis to finally champion responsible man-	113.40046691894531	332.2469787597656	10.97998046875	368.34608459472656	6
agement education? While the economic downturn surely has remarkable negative	113.40046691894531	344.24700927734375	10.97998046875	368.63035583496094	6
effects on peoples’ lives around the globe, it also creates a lot of promise, not least for	113.40046691894531	356.2470397949219	10.97998046875	368.46241760253906	6
the further dissemination and upscaling of responsible management education. The	113.40046691894531	368.2470703125	10.97998046875	368.47120666503906	6
time is ripe for leading change with regard to responsible management education, in	113.40046691894531	380.2471008300781	10.97998046875	368.50965881347656	6
Germany and elsewhere. We are living in difficult and promising times, or as Ángel	113.40046691894531	392.24713134765625	11.017242431640625	368.4525604248047	6
Cabrera (2009), President of Thunderbird School of Global Management, argued	113.40156555175781	404.2471618652344	10.97998046875	368.51063537597656	6
recently: “Let’s not waste a good crisis!”	113.40156555175781	416.2471923828125	10.97998046875	170.49415588378906	6
The argument which we would like to present here is as follows. When considering	113.40156555175781	431.2469787597656	10.97998046875	368.46241760253906	6
the changing context of responsible management education – mostly driven by the	113.40156555175781	443.24700927734375	10.97998046875	368.5228729248047	6
recent global economic downturn but also by a more general suspicion that business	113.40156555175781	455.2470397949219	10.97998046875	368.4909210205078	6
schools cannot deliver what they promise – we should not waste this opportunity to	113.40156555175781	467.2470703125	10.97998046875	368.5478973388672	6
finally put responsible management education in its rightful place: at the strategic core	113.40155029296875	479.2471008300781	10.97998046875	368.680908203125	6
of the business school curriculum. We propose to consider the Principles for Responsible	113.40155029296875	491.24713134765625	11.017242431640625	368.4997253417969	6
Management Education (abbreviated PRME, pronounced ‘prime’) as one possible change	113.40042114257812	503.2471923828125	11.0172119140625	368.5173034667969	6
agent to drive this process. The PRME embody a voluntary set of principles to which	113.40042114257812	515.2471923828125	10.97998046875	368.4745178222656	6

sary insights and skills to reflect upon, critically analyze, and provide leadership with	113.40042114257812	539.2472534179688	10.97998046875	368.58978271484375	6

We think there are at least two recent developments which should put responsible	113.40000915527344	170.00653076171875	10.97998046875	368.54795837402344	12

From our perspective, both debates create a ‘window of opportunity’ to finally start	113.40000915527344	194.00665283203125	10.97998046875	368.50843811035156	12

tices of business schools. We consider these developments to be as much of relevance	113.40000915527344	218.00677490234375	10.97998046875	368.51853942871094	12
for German academic institutions as they are for the rest of the world.	113.39999389648438	230.0068359375	10.97998046875	298.3045959472656	12
First, there is the discussion around whether business school education (or rather the	113.39999389648438	245.006591796875	10.97998046875	368.5206298828125	13
lack of it) is to blame for the recent financial crisis. Of course, no one would seriously	113.40000915527344	257.00665283203125	10.97998046875	368.4778289794922	13
claim that academic institutions are exclusively responsible for the economic down-	113.40000915527344	269.0067138671875	10.97998046875	368.4086151123047	13
turn. However, it cannot be neglected that business schools educated many of those	113.40000915527344	281.00677490234375	10.97998046875	368.64137268066406	13
people who contributed to the current crisis in one way or another. Many commenta-	113.40000915527344	293.0068359375	10.97998046875	368.48326110839844	13
tors raise doubts about whether business school education in general and MBA pro-	113.40000915527344	305.00689697265625	10.97998046875	368.4459686279297	13
grams in particular adequately prepare students for the ethical challenges they face in	113.40000915527344	317.0069580078125	10.97998046875	368.4359893798828	13
their later careers. The Wall Street Journal, for instance, argues that business schools, by	113.40000915527344	329.0069580078125	11.01727294921875	368.51182556152344	13
failing to systemically and critically discuss issues such as executive incentive pro-	113.40000915527344	341.00701904296875	10.97998046875	368.61289978027344	13
grams, have contributed to the financial crisis (Jacobs 2009). Likewise, The New York	113.4000244140625	353.0070495605469	11.017242431640625	368.4832763671875	13
Times wonders whether “the way business students are taught may have contributed to	113.4000244140625	365.007080078125	11.017242431640625	368.5183410644531	13
the most serious economic crisis in decades” (Holland 2009). The bottom line is that	113.40001678466797	377.0071105957031	10.97998046875	368.5469436645508	13
we cannot solely neglect that business schools have a responsibility to train their stu-	113.40000915527344	389.00714111328125	10.97998046875	368.5150604248047	13
dents in a responsible way. As James Post (2009) remarked recently in the Financial	113.40000915527344	401.0071716308594	11.017242431640625	368.5228729248047	13
Times, “schools must now reinvent themselves as part of the solution”.	113.4000244140625	413.0072021484375	11.017242431640625	300.2425842285156	13
Second, there is the argument that business schools’ overemphasis on market mecha-	113.40000915527344	428.0069885253906	10.97998046875	368.49644470214844	14
nisms and the importance of companies’ stock prices failed to teach students that they	113.4000244140625	440.00701904296875	10.97998046875	368.64923095703125	14
are part of a profession which is responsible for more than shareholder value	113.4000244140625	452.0070495605469	10.97998046875	368.4580383300781	14
(Khurana 2007). Management, as Khurana argues, is as much a profession as medicine	113.4000244140625	464.007080078125	10.97998046875	368.5206604003906	14
or law. Business schools, however, never taught their students that they were part of a	113.4000244140625	476.0071105957031	10.97998046875	368.5096130371094	14
profession and thus expected to uphold basic ethical values. While it would be naïve	113.40000915527344	488.00714111328125	10.97998046875	368.5602264404297	14
to believe that professionalization of the management field would ipso facto make	113.40000915527344	500.0071716308594	11.017242431640625	368.4789581298828	14
graduates more responsible, it is not unreasonable to suppose that a professionaliza-	113.40005493164062	512.0072021484375	10.97998046875	368.32183837890625	14
tion (e.g., expressed through a widely accepted code of conduct) could at least help to	113.40005493164062	524.0072021484375	10.97998046875	368.5545959472656	14
change business schools’ culture and foster students’ reflections. In other words, the	113.40005493164062	536.0072631835938	10.97998046875	368.5315246582031	14
current crisis has presented us, and the public at large, with the evidence that man-	113.40005493164062	548.00732421875	10.97998046875	368.4404602050781	14
agement carries with its decisions an important (positive or negative) social impact. In	113.40003967285156	560.00732421875	10.97998046875	368.53819274902344	14
that sense, management is a profession that has to do with the common public good.	113.40003967285156	572.00732421875	10.97998046875	368.47889709472656	14
Hence, infusing the sense of responsibility in future leaders and professionals about	113.40003967285156	584.0074462890625	10.980010986328125	368.59523010253906	14

differ considerably (e.g., when looking at differences in legal systems and/or existing	113.4000244140625	413.00604248046875	10.97998046875	368.51409912109375	37

The PRME grew in part because business leaders, who have committed themselves to	113.4000244140625	170.00653076171875	10.97998046875	368.5634460449219	43

Any serious and long-term consideration of responsible management needs to include	113.4000244140625	206.0067138671875	10.97998046875	368.55462646484375	43

only twelve participating institutions are located in Germany. Hence, the PRME –	113.39892578125	551.007080078125	10.97998046875	368.4701232910156	47

First, any institution which joins the PRME enjoys the benefits of being a recognized	113.39892578125	662.0072021484375	10.979995727539062	368.4789123535156	48

the curriculum from students and potential employers alike. According to Blaine	113.39999389648438	215.007080078125	10.97998046875	368.5404357910156	49
(2009), most schools have already witnessed a steep increase in ethics-related courses	113.39999389648438	227.00714111328125	10.97998046875	368.5392761230469	49
which has put responsible management education in its rightful place. The PRME can	113.39997863769531	239.0072021484375	10.97998046875	368.5184783935547	49

ceived as leaders in the field of responsible management education.	113.39997863769531	263.00732421875	10.97998046875	285.6040802001953	49
Second, the PRME can act as an internal change agent when trying to advance the	113.39997863769531	278.007080078125	10.97998046875	368.46900939941406	50

keting, operations, human resources management or strategic management. As the	113.39997863769531	302.0072021484375	10.97998046875	368.5106658935547	50
principles need to be signed by the highest-ranking executive of a business school, it is	113.39997863769531	314.00726318359375	10.97998046875	368.65354919433594	50
reasonable to expect that ‘after the signature’ there should be some top-level support	113.39997863769531	326.00726318359375	10.980010986328125	368.4986114501953	50
for pushing ethical issues into the curriculum. Considering the many micro-political	113.39997863769531	338.00732421875	10.97998046875	368.49546813964844	50
struggles within business schools (e.g., between different departments), support and	113.39997863769531	350.0073547363281	10.97998046875	368.6040802001953	50
effective leadership from a high-ranking executive (e.g., the Dean) can help to over-	113.39997863769531	362.00738525390625	10.97998046875	368.5326690673828	50
come ideological barriers to create interest and acceptance for ethical issues within the	113.39996337890625	374.0074157714844	10.97998046875	368.51947021484375	50

down mode. Rather, the backing by high-ranking decision makers should support	113.39996337890625	398.0074768066406	10.97998046875	368.46124267578125	50
grassroots ideas coming from different parts of the faculty. Our findings, out of the	113.39996337890625	410.00750732421875	10.97998046875	368.47015380859375	50
experience gathered throughout the PRME community, clearly suggest that both a	113.39996337890625	422.0075378417969	10.97998046875	368.5370788574219	50
top-down approach and a bottom-up approach are necessary to make progress along	113.39996337890625	434.007568359375	10.97998046875	368.5316467285156	50

Third, joining the PRME gives access to a strong network of likeminded institutions.	113.39997863769531	461.00738525390625	10.97998046875	368.52500915527344	51
The 1st Global Forum for Responsible Management Education, which was held in New York	113.39997863769531	473.0067138671875	11.0179443359375	368.44972229003906	51

that access to this network can give a school a competitive edge in times where the	113.40042114257812	497.00677490234375	10.97998046875	368.6523742675781	51

To conclude, we think there is a lot of promise when considering the current status of	113.40155029296875	608.0068359375	10.979995727539062	368.5316162109375	52

search, and the PRME are a necessary and timely initiative to support this process. We	113.40155029296875	656.0070190429688	10.979995727539062	368.5426025390625	52

and the PRME in particular. Leading the necessary change requires accepting that	113.4000015258789	143.0067138671875	10.97998046875	368.61946868896484	56
responsible management has to be one key strategic concern of any business school	113.40000915527344	155.00677490234375	10.97998046875	368.4755096435547	56
