ABSTRACT	70.62399291992188	328.20416259765625	11.03997802734375	59.891998291015625	7
Prompt advancement in product / service and process technology, many operations in the	98.9439926147461	346.56414794921875	11.040008544921875	425.32694244384766	8
manufacturing and service industries in recent years require competitive HR practices. So this research	70.62399291992188	359.2841491699219	11.040008544921875	453.7489929199219	8
study stresses on HR planning and audit practices. HR planning is all about good management; good	70.62399291992188	371.8841247558594	11.040008544921875	453.7417907714844	8
strategic management; good business management and particularly good people management. It is	70.62399291992188	384.484130859375	11.040008544921875	453.2582092285156	8
important that you put thought and careful planning into your human resource practices. And the	70.62399291992188	397.2041320800781	11.040008544921875	453.7777404785156	8
purpose of the HR Audit is to conduct a more in-depth analysis of the HR function to identify areas of	70.62399291992188	409.80413818359375	11.040008544921875	453.5281066894531	8
strength and weakness and where improvements may be needed. Conducting an audit involves a	70.62399291992188	422.5241394042969	11.040008544921875	453.4570007324219	8

organizations of similar size and/or industry. This research aims to figure out the practices, employee	70.62399291992188	447.744140625	11.040008544921875	453.3648376464844	8

1. INTRODUCTION	70.62399291992188	590.7314453125	12.0	110.97599792480469	10
The historical role of Human Resources has changed spectacularly since its inception in	98.9439926147461	618.1214599609375	12.0	425.0860366821289	11
the early 1900s. Formerly it was mainly a clerical function but now human resource is a	70.62399291992188	631.9214477539062	12.0	453.7240295410156	11
strategic partner in planning and attaining organizational policies and goals. Today’s business	70.62399291992188	645.721435546875	12.0	453.1681213378906	11
climate puts the obligation on the HR department to accept the challenge of doing more with	70.62399291992188	659.521484375	12.0	453.3380432128906	11
less, while contributing value toward business objectives. Human resources also has to	70.62399291992188	673.3214721679688	12.0	453.2279357910156	11
address the rapidly changing conditions affecting the type of employees required and their	70.62399291992188	687.1214599609375	12.0	453.1800231933594	11
changing needs, so the function requires flexible and knowledgeable practitioners. Hence HR	70.62399291992188	700.9214477539062	12.0	453.3680114746094	11
planning has become an integral part of business. All companies, organizations, institutions	70.62399291992188	714.721435546875	12.0	453.6580505371094	11
consist of people and are meant to serve the people with products and services. Humans,	70.62399291992188	728.521484375	12.0	453.3360290527344	11
therefore, are not only the resources of organizations but are the main instrument of their	70.62399291992188	742.3174438476562	12.0	453.3120422363281	11

progress. It is not enough to say „people are our most precious asset of business. Instead we	70.62399291992188	99.04150390625	12.0	453.2999572753906	15
must say our company or organization (including its results) is a creation of our people.	70.62399291992188	112.84149169921875	12.0	420.3279724121094	15
In order to pace the talk of being a “business partner,” HR managers have to provide	98.9439926147461	126.6414794921875	12.0	425.03006744384766	15
real evidence that they are having a strategic business impact. Management is often asking,	70.62399291992188	140.44146728515625	12.0	453.1920471191406	15
“How are we doing?” However, this is not always an easy question to answer. This is	70.62399291992188	154.24151611328125	12.0	453.4720764160156	15
especially so, when it is difficult to obtain some type of objective measuring tool to determine	70.62399291992188	168.04150390625	12.0	453.2040710449219	15
how well a certain HR function is performing. To validate the claim of being “business	70.62399291992188	181.84149169921875	12.0	453.4060363769531	15
partners”, HR managers must clearly demonstrate how HR services can accomplish the	70.62399291992188	195.6414794921875	12.0	453.5740051269531	15
business objectives set forth by the organization. The HR function is often overlooked for	70.62399291992188	209.44146728515625	12.0	453.3119201660156	15
audits/measurement tools, to assess its effectiveness and legal regulatory compliance.	70.62399291992188	223.24151611328125	12.0	453.3360290527344	15
However, the HR Audit is a process that sets the stage for a true transformation in HR	70.62399291992188	237.04150390625	12.0	453.5020446777344	15
strategy and services. It links HR systems and services to organizational objectives while	70.62399291992188	250.84149169921875	12.0	453.2400817871094	15
focusing on the business needs of internal customers.	70.62399291992188	264.6715087890625	12.0	255.2039794921875	15
The success of a business is directly linked to the performance of those who work for	98.9439926147461	278.47149658203125	12.0	425.2719497680664	15
that business. Underachievement can be a result of workplace failures. Because hiring the	70.62399291992188	292.271484375	12.0	453.4299621582031	15
wrong people or failing to anticipate fluctuations in hiring needs can be costly, it is important	70.62399291992188	306.07147216796875	12.0	453.3619689941406	15
that you put effort into human resource planning. Planning for HR needs will help to ensure	70.62399291992188	319.87152099609375	11.999969482421875	453.4659729003906	15
your employees have the skills and competencies your business needs to succeed. It will	70.62399291992188	333.67144775390625	12.0	453.6159973144531	15
better prepare you for staff turnover, recruitment, and strategic hiring – and improve stress	70.62399291992188	347.4714660644531	12.0	453.6520690917969	15
when you have emergency/last-minute hiring needs. With effective human resource planning,	70.62399291992188	361.2714538574219	12.0	453.3500061035156	15
HR audit implies critical examination and evaluation of policies, programs and procedures in	70.62399291992188	375.07147216796875	12.0	453.5500183105469	15

2. DOES HR PLANNING AND AUDIT MATTERS?	70.62399291992188	430.5314636230469	12.0	274.7659912109375	16
In essence, workforce or HR planning is about predicting future labor market needs. It	98.9439926147461	457.8914489746094	12.0	425.17594146728516	17
requires an understanding of the make-up of the current workforce, an investigation into	70.62399291992188	471.69146728515625	12.0	453.5779724121094	17
future service needs and an analysis of the type and size of workforce required to meet them.	70.62399291992188	485.491455078125	12.0	453.1878967285156	17
It is becoming increasingly important for agencies as they adopt new ways of operating in	70.62399291992188	499.2914733886719	12.0	453.1759948730469	17
order to adapt to changes.	70.62399291992188	513.0914306640625	12.0	123.57199096679688	17
The challenge will be to ensure that agencies can minimize the costs and grab the	98.9439926147461	526.8914794921875	12.0	424.9319839477539	17
opportunities that such changes brings - quicker career progression, effective recruitment, and	70.62399291992188	540.6914672851562	12.0	453.5499572753906	17
more flexible job design and workforce deployment. By identifying workforce capabilities	70.62399291992188	554.491455078125	12.0	453.3599548339844	17
and by considering what will be needed in the future and planning systematically, managers	70.62399291992188	568.29150390625	12.0	453.2040710449219	17
can limit the risks associated with unanticipated events. In particular, HR planning will help	70.62399291992188	582.0914306640625	12.0	453.5379943847656	17

generational change taking place in the workforce. Labor market supply and demand factors,	70.62399291992188	597.721435546875	12.0	453.5260925292969	54
work and family considerations, and equity and diversity issues are rapidly taking place.	70.62399291992188	611.521484375	12.0	423.5400085449219	54
For example, The Company has an older age profile and its workforce is mature aged	98.9439926147461	625.3214721679688	12.0	424.85990142822266	54
and significant numbers of senior staff are approaching retirement, which means valuable	70.62399291992188	639.1214599609375	12.0	453.5299987792969	54
corporate knowledge could be lost.	70.62399291992188	652.9214477539062	12.0	168.30001831054688	54
Hence, in this dynamic scenario, the importance of human resource planning and audit	98.9439926147461	666.721435546875	12.0	425.27201080322266	54
can’t be neglected. On the other hand Auditing HR practices require assessing the	70.62399291992188	680.521484375	12.0	453.5559997558594	54
arrangement of services offered by an HR department. Hence effective implementation of HR	70.62399291992188	694.3214721679688	12.0	453.5620422363281	54

Sanjeev K. Bordoloi, Hirofumi Matsuo (2001) studies that because of rapid evolution in	70.62399291992188	126.6414794921875	12.0	453.5500183105469	58
product and process technology, many operations in the manufacturing and service industries	70.62399291992188	140.44146728515625	12.0	453.5680236816406	58
in recent years require workers to acquire and maintain more extensive ``knowledge stock''	70.62399291992188	154.24151611328125	12.0	453.3840637207031	58
than before. In this paper, we address the human resource planning in these knowledge-	70.62399291992188	168.04150390625	12.0	453.7119445800781	58
intensive operations. We focus on the management of knowledge mix, that is, the mix of	70.62399291992188	181.84149169921875	12.0	453.8080139160156	58
workers in different knowledge levels. This research was conducted in a semiconductor	70.62399291992188	195.6414794921875	12.0	453.5559997558594	58
equipment manufacturing plant that uses an assembly line to achieve high productivity.	70.62399291992188	209.44146728515625	12.0	453.5080261230469	58
However, the plant also needs to increase ability to deal with a high degree of product	70.62399291992188	223.24151611328125	12.0	453.5199890136719	58
customization, frequent technology and product changes, and relatively low volume of	70.62399291992188	237.04150390625	12.0	453.3858947753906	58
production, which collectively require a high level of knowledge development for each	70.62399291992188	250.84149169921875	12.0	453.5320739746094	58
worker. We extend methodology developed for managing production and work-in-process	70.62399291992188	264.6715087890625	12.0	453.5200500488281	58
inventory levels for a manufacturing system that is subject to random production yields.	70.62399291992188	278.47149658203125	12.0	453.3559875488281	58
However, the structure of our problem is different, and thus requires a separate mathematical	70.62399291992188	292.271484375	12.0	453.4820251464844	58
development. Our results indicate that the company we studied underestimated the ideal	70.62399291992188	306.07147216796875	12.0	453.6939392089844	58
number of workers in the higher knowledge levels in the steady state. But this problem, by	70.62399291992188	319.87152099609375	11.999969482421875	453.7840270996094	58
itself, can be taken care of by a good intuitive heuristic. We then demonstrate that our control	70.62399291992188	333.67144775390625	12.0	453.3000183105469	58
rule is superior to the good intuitive rule from the point of view of additional stability that is	70.62399291992188	347.4714660644531	12.0	453.5540466308594	58
obtained from less variability in the work force levels. We offer managerial implications of	70.62399291992188	361.2714538574219	12.0	453.6940002441406	58
this additional stability using our computational results [10].	70.62399291992188	375.07147216796875	12.0	290.08599853515625	58
Ghazala Ishrat, Javed Habib (2012) finds that in the changing economic and business	70.62399291992188	394.8714599609375	12.0	453.4900817871094	59
environment, proper Human Resource Management has assumed a crucial role in the growth	70.62399291992188	408.67144775390625	12.0	453.3720397949219	59
of the organization. It has become imperative to re-look at this most important asset of the	70.62399291992188	422.4714660644531	12.0	453.5740661621094	59
organization. The main objective behind this research was to gain in-depth knowledge of the	70.62399291992188	436.2914733886719	12.0	453.6220397949219	59
Human Resource and the effectiveness of HR functions within an organization. The HR audit	70.62399291992188	450.0914611816406	12.0	453.4199523925781	59
in University was planned to get a clear judgment about the overall status of most	70.62399291992188	463.8914489746094	12.0	453.4560241699219	59
faculties/Departments and to find out whether existing systems and procedures are yielding	70.62399291992188	477.69146728515625	12.0	453.4700622558594	59
desired result. This information will be an invaluable input while making strategic decisions.	70.62399291992188	491.491455078125	12.0	453.3719787597656	59
The human resource audit involved examining current policies, practices and strategies of all	70.62399291992188	505.29150390625	12.0	453.2400207519531	59
the departments/faculties to verify the effectiveness and helping University to improve its	70.62399291992188	519.0914306640625	12.0	453.1921081542969	59
productivity, transparency and efficiency. To conduct Human Resource Audit in University	70.62399291992188	532.8914794921875	12.0	453.4320983886719	59
extensive study on various aspects related to faculties, students and staff were analyzed and	70.62399291992188	546.6914672851562	12.0	453.6039733886719	59
studied through interviews of staff at various levels, observation of working of non teaching	70.62399291992188	560.491455078125	12.0	453.3960266113281	59
staff, taking responses from students and staff by questionnaire method and documents review	70.62399291992188	574.29150390625	12.0	453.3720397949219	59
at various levels. The firsthand experience has helped us in our specialization in HR as this	70.62399291992188	588.0914306640625	12.0	453.4779968261719	59
enhanced our prospective of thoughts. The concise suggestions/ recommendations emerged	70.62399291992188	601.9214477539062	12.0	453.2280578613281	59
after in depth analysis and study will provide with a wide scope to understand the functions	70.62399291992188	615.721435546875	12.0	453.1679382324219	59
and mechanism of working in any organization [4].	70.62399291992188	629.521484375	12.0	246.64599609375	59
Dr. Shikha N. Khera, Ms. Karishma Gulati (2012) states that Human resource information	70.62399291992188	649.3214721679688	12.0	453.4660339355469	60
system (HRIS) is not new concept but it is recuperating day by day with changing	70.62399291992188	663.1214599609375	12.0	453.2760925292969	60
environment. Its major role is in human resource planning (HRP) which itself a crucial	70.62399291992188	676.9214477539062	12.0	453.2760925292969	60
activity in any organization. Ineffective HRP can lead to extra or fewer numbers of employees	70.62399291992188	690.721435546875	12.0	453.4300842285156	60
than needed. Both over and under number of employees can create crappy situations. HRIS	70.62399291992188	704.521484375	11.999992370605469	453.2640075683594	60
helps in proper planning of human resources. This paper focuses on the role of HRIS in HRP.	70.62399291992188	718.3214721679688	12.0	453.3839416503906	60
The research is empirical in nature as 127 respondents from top 7 IT companies (as per their	70.62399291992188	732.1214599609375	12.0	453.3619689941406	60
market share) are taken to see the sights of the objectives. The survey is done with the	70.62399291992188	745.91748046875	12.0	453.1920471191406	60

assistance of the questionnaire. After investigation it is concluded that HRIS has various	70.62399291992188	99.04150390625	12.0	453.2880554199219	63
benefits but the foremost is HRIS stores ample data about the employees of the organizations	70.62399291992188	112.84149169921875	12.0	453.3860778808594	63
that helps in escalating the snail’s pace of HRP. HRIS also helps in the strategic activities of	70.62399291992188	126.6414794921875	12.0	453.3719787597656	63
