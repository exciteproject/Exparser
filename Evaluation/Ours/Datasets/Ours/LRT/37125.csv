This volume presents several authors who are developing research projects in various European	108.0199966430664	417.8089294433594	12.0	431.63997650146484	7
universities and research institutions. In spite of the independent character of the analyses and of the most	72.02400207519531	431.61181640625	12.017120361328125	467.87815856933594	7
of the empirical observations and results reported here, there is something which unites them all, namely a	72.02400207519531	445.3089294433594	12.0	467.5082244873047	7
certain similarity in looking at things from a political culture perspective. Moreover, there is something else	72.02400207519531	459.0918273925781	12.017120361328125	467.6361541748047	7
which unites their perspectives over the Eastern European political cultures: a certain look from inside. The	72.02400207519531	472.8918151855469	12.017120361328125	468.13597106933594	7
true motivation for what joins them all in this volume could be described as a need for explanation, no	72.02400207519531	486.7089538574219	12.0	467.76206970214844	7

It is this need for explanation which makes the true binding – either implicit or explicit – of this	108.0199966430664	527.9889526367188	12.0	432.1880111694336	7

The need for explanation should not surprise anybody, especially if we are to study the Eastern	108.0199966430664	100.49896240234375	12.0	431.5201644897461	14
European politics. Nevertheless, it is more than just the necessity to explain (what?) and how? is going on	72.02400207519531	114.16180419921875	12.01715087890625	468.1000213623047	14
in politics. It is also the need to understand why?, when?, or what for? The long transition processes from	72.02400207519531	127.96185302734375	12.01715087890625	468.02195739746094	14
the communist to democratic regimes made almost all Eastern European people and their countries	72.02400207519531	141.77899169921875	12.0	468.1840057373047	14
experience during the past two decades the need to explain their choices, values, beliefs, norms, attitudes,	72.02400207519531	155.458984375	12.0	467.42417907714844	14
and symbols. Their grievances or prejudices. Their institutions, regimes, and discourses. All these entail a	72.02400207519531	169.25897216796875	12.0	467.52012634277344	14
deep understanding of both remote cultural roots and current political perceptions, steadiness and	72.02400207519531	183.0589599609375	12.0	467.7981414794922	14
variability, contingency and necessity, change and resistance to change. They require not only to explain	72.02400207519531	196.85894775390625	12.0	467.4841766357422	14
things. First and foremost, they require a concept, a paradigm, and a method. It often requires a model.	72.02400207519531	210.5218505859375	12.01715087890625	448.73204040527344	14
The modeling idea is as old as our philosophical thinking. It reminds us of Plato and makes us think	108.0199966430664	224.3389892578125	12.0	431.5799789428711	14
about the city, world, society and politics as of imperfect shadows of one perfect idea. To understand them,	72.02400207519531	238.13897705078125	12.0	467.4481658935547	14
we need first of all to overlap the “real” and the “ideal”, the “shadows” and the “model”. It is this overlapping	72.02400207519531	251.968994140625	12.0	467.4858856201172	14
which explains what the real construct – be it society or polity, tradition or institution, individual action or	72.02400207519531	265.64898681640625	12.0	467.8101043701172	14
policy – actually needs in order to identify itself with the ideal construct.	72.02400207519531	279.448974609375	11.999969482421875	308.69801330566406	14
Modeling is, as a matter of fact, a relevant component of Political Science: ideology, political	108.0199966430664	293.2489318847656	12.0	431.5920639038086	14
regime, state, governance or voting – all of them have been modeled and analyzed by means of models.	72.02400207519531	307.0489501953125	12.0	454.6582489013672	14
Before anything else, a model “explains” the real world by capturing few but universal laws,	108.0199966430664	320.72894287109375	12.0	431.85005950927734	14
principles. It thus makes both modeler and user develop expectations with respect to its explanative power.	72.02400207519531	334.5289306640625	12.0	467.52012634277344	14
Whether these are finally fulfilled or not, this depends on the model. In the classical approach, models as	72.02400207519531	348.3289489746094	12.0	468.1000213623047	14
explanative tools involve covering laws. For example, economic laws and ideas do explain the	72.02400207519531	362.1289367675781	12.0	467.6282196044922	14
transformation processes in the Eastern European newly appeared democracies, but they cannot fully	72.02400207519531	375.8089294433594	12.0	467.55601501464844	14
explain them, and obviously not them all.	72.02400207519531	389.60894775390625	12.0	177.64796447753906	14
After the first decade following the 1989- Eastern European political phenomena, students of	108.0199966430664	403.408935546875	12.0	431.8701400756836	14
democracy identified the main characteristics of the Eastern European transition to democratic regime	72.02400207519531	417.2089538574219	12.0	467.5798797607422	14
processes and tried to explain their unfolding. It was probably the first time when many agreed that, beyond	72.02400207519531	430.908935546875	12.0	467.8779754638672	14
economical difficulties, there were some others which did not fit this model and resisted explanations based	72.02400207519531	444.7089538574219	12.0	467.4961395263672	14
on covering economical laws. Explaining politics requires more than social, economical and financial	72.02400207519531	458.5089416503906	12.0	468.2400360107422	14
methodologies altogether: it requires political methodology. Moreover, it requires a political methodology	72.02400207519531	472.3089294433594	12.0	467.56822204589844	14
able to reconsider such issues like variability, context-, path- and initial conditions dependence in order to	72.02400207519531	485.98895263671875	12.0	467.8661346435547	14
explain one of the fundamental questions in the post-1989 political analysis and methodology (Tilly, 1995):	72.02400207519531	499.7889404296875	12.0	467.90208435058594	14
how should we study the political change? – Long after the 1989 Eastern European political phenomena,	72.02400207519531	513.5889892578125	12.0	467.7501678466797	14
people still argued on the nature of political change, on its real target and on its real means and ends.	72.02400207519531	527.3889770507812	12.000015258789062	468.04002380371094	14
Invariable models of political change could not tackle anymore the complexity of the political history and	72.02400207519531	541.0689697265625	12.0	467.5320281982422	14
failed to fulfill the need for explanation of both scholars, either old or young, and of the people, either	72.02400207519531	554.8689575195312	12.0	467.4719696044922	14
ordinary people or elites.	72.02400207519531	568.6689453125	12.0	107.82798767089844	14
Unavoidably, political culture came to the front. In spite of the hard critics and apparently never	108.0199966430664	582.468994140625	12.0	431.57991790771484	14
ending disputes, political culture theories have suceeded to find room for “impressive” coming-backs	72.02400207519531	596.178955078125	12.0	468.17198181152344	14
(Mishler and Pollack, 2003) and for managing ambiguity in definitions and terminology. It is not the first time	72.02400207519531	609.9789428710938	12.0	467.7141571044922	14
when they do come back and, most probably, not the last. However, this time there is something missing in	72.02400207519531	623.7789306640625	12.0	467.4719696044922	14
the room: explanative power requires explanative methodology. And a good explanation methodology	72.02400207519531	637.5789794921875	12.0	468.1119842529297	14
cannot ignore or avoid modeling. Nevertheless, it is modeling which is actually missing in this room.	72.02400207519531	651.2589721679688	12.0	431.9640655517578	14
The past two decades have been known as a time of intensive theoretical and empirical research	108.0199966430664	665.0589599609375	12.0	431.4120101928711	14
in Eastern European political cultures. Remarcable works have been published by now famous authors:	72.02400207519531	678.8589477539062	12.0	467.7262420654297	14

1989, when the Eastern Europeans were struggling and striving in the sophisticated transition processes	72.02400207519531	266.36895751953125	12.0	467.8700408935547	19
toward democratization and economic stability. It was a time of high political contend. However, more than	72.02400207519531	280.1689453125	12.0	467.5200653076172	19
two decades have passed and, notwithstanding its weakness and scarcity, the democratic construction	72.02400207519531	293.96893310546875	12.0	468.07603454589844	19
has provided a chance for reflection. As the time passed, the Eastern Europeans – citizens as well as	72.02400207519531	307.7689514160156	12.0	468.13597106933594	19

present volume. The Conclusions show that the Eastern European political culture research exhibits	72.02400207519531	100.49896240234375	12.0	468.0699920654297	24
preferences for a particular relationship between (i) the political values, identity, behaviors and attitudes	72.02400207519531	114.178955078125	12.0	467.44798278808594	24
modeling, on the one hand, and for (ii) the generative simulation modeling of political phenomena, on the	72.02400207519531	127.97900390625	12.0	467.36399841308594	24
other hand. This relationship is described as a political methodological relationship between political	72.02400207519531	141.7618408203125	12.01715087890625	468.19602966308594	24
mechanisms and political cultures.	72.02400207519531	155.44183349609375	12.01715087890625	150.0019989013672	24
Getting back to the rationale of this volume, we should emphasize again the independent character	108.0199966430664	169.25897216796875	12.0	431.6281967163086	24
of the researches presented in this volume. It is important to do this for three reasons. One relates their	72.02400207519531	183.0589599609375	12.0	467.6779022216797	24
independent character to the reality that Eastern European political science research is guided from within	72.02400207519531	196.85894775390625	12.0	467.38804626464844	24
the society, and this proves both the awareness of researchers and the social utility of their approaches.	72.02400207519531	210.53900146484375	12.0	467.9499969482422	24
Another one relates the scarce appearances of political culture modeling research in Eastern Europe to the	72.02400207519531	224.3389892578125	12.0	467.44822692871094	24
scarcity of its research funding, which seriously limits its development, but nevertheless cannot stop it. And	72.02400207519531	238.13897705078125	12.0	467.54417419433594	24
finally, a third reason concerns the extension of political culture theories so as to include new elements	72.02400207519531	251.968994140625	12.0	467.5201873779297	24
provided by the interdisciplinary research in areas like European welfare culture or neighborhood culture,	72.02400207519531	265.64898681640625	12.0	467.5680389404297	24
which emerged from latest political unfoldings in Eastern and Southern Europe following either 2008	72.02400207519531	279.448974609375	11.999969482421875	467.77415466308594	24
economical crisis or EU partnership policies.	72.02400207519531	293.2489318847656	12.0	193.0199737548828	24
First, although independently developed, some of the Eastern European political analysis	108.0199966430664	307.0318298339844	12.017120361328125	431.68209075927734	24
researches included in the volume share a major theoretical tendency towards modeling approaches of	72.02400207519531	320.72894287109375	12.0	467.9141082763672	24
political issues, including political action and political attitude, voting behavior and electoral campaigns,	72.02400207519531	334.5289306640625	12.0	467.54417419433594	24
political messages and political images on the Eastern European electoral market, post-communist	72.02400207519531	348.3289489746094	12.0	468.1600799560547	24
institutional authority and legitimacy, ethnicity and nationalism, constitutionalism and autoritarianism,	72.02400207519531	362.1289367675781	12.0	467.4680633544922	24
corruption and extortion, and many others. As political methodology, Eastern European political	72.02400207519531	375.8089294433594	12.0	467.5200653076172	24
phenomena modeling research reported in this volume addresses fundamental issues concerning (1) the	72.02400207519531	389.60894775390625	12.0	467.95005798339844	24
type of democracy constructs elaborated by the Eastern European countries, and (2) political identity,	72.02400207519531	403.408935546875	12.0	467.60398864746094	24
sovereignity and political action of the new Eastern European democracies inside EU or outside EU, but	72.02400207519531	417.2089538574219	12.0	467.50791931152344	24
expecting for the EU intergration. As concerning the type of democratic construct and democracy	72.02400207519531	430.908935546875	12.0	467.70811462402344	24
perception in each Eastern European country, these researches share the idea of political cultures as	72.02400207519531	444.7089538574219	12.0	467.4242401123047	24
influence factors in the political change modeling.	72.02400207519531	458.5089416503906	12.0	214.2840118408203	24
From this perspective, two authors succeed to bring to the front old political culture research issues	108.0199966430664	472.3089294433594	12.0	431.7660140991211	24
and to provide fresh answers.	72.02400207519531	485.98895263671875	12.0	128.9640350341797	24
Bojan Todosijević’s research on the structure of political attitudes reports fundamental	108.0199966430664	499.7889404296875	12.0	431.7061996459961	24
approaches during the past almost hundred years in the area of structure of ideology. Political attitudes	72.02400207519531	513.5889892578125	12.0	467.92588806152344	24
made the subject of political analysis and political methodology from the beginning of the 20th century.	72.02400207519531	527.3889770507812	12.000015258789062	468.1479949951172	24
Todosijević systematically reports research on attitudes in Social Psychology emphasizing the difference	72.02400207519531	541.0689697265625	12.0	468.1239471435547	24
between the long tradition and huge number of theoretical and analytical works, on the one hand, and their	72.02400207519531	554.8689575195312	12.0	467.4962615966797	24
low level of impact on the attitude methodological research and development, on the other hand. He is a	72.02400207519531	568.6689453125	12.0	467.31602478027344	24
promoter of the idea that ideological dimensions have a relevant impact on the political behavior. Such	72.02400207519531	582.468994140625	12.0	467.78611755371094	24
orientation of research would not only help understanding political action, but has a special relevance in the	72.02400207519531	596.178955078125	12.0	467.43614196777344	24
Eastern European political space, where the communist ideology’s late impact has shaped “atypical	72.02400207519531	609.9617919921875	12.01715087890625	468.17198181152344	24
ideological configurations” (p. 35 in this volume). This idea points to the particular ways in which citizens in	72.02400207519531	623.7618408203125	12.01708984375	467.72593688964844	24
the Eastern European post-communist regimes “organize and express their basic political views” (ibid.).	72.02400207519531	637.5618286132812	12.01715087890625	467.8702850341797	24

the use of agent-based system simulation in the development of a political culture model of a mafia-type	72.02400207519531	265.64898681640625	12.0	468.1479949951172	34
