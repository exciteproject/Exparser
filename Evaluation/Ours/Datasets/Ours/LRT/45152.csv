Sport’s historic attraction for policy makers has been its claims that it can offer an economy of remedies to seemingly	54.0	252.59002685546875	9.9599609375	486.7054443359375	6
intractable social problems—“social inclusion”, “development”. Such usually vague and ill-defined claims reflect sport’s	54.0	264.83001708984375	9.9599609375	487.2265625	6
marginal policy status and its attempts to prove its more general relevance. The dominance of evangelical beliefs and	54.0	277.10003662109375	9.9599609375	486.65557861328125	6

odological development of policy and practice. There is a need to de-reify “sport” and to address the issue of sufficient	54.0	301.46002197265625	9.9599609375	487.37030029296875	6
conditions—the mechanisms, processes and experiences which might produce positive impacts for some participants.	54.0	313.70001220703125	9.9599609375	487.03900146484375	6
This requires researchers and practitioners to develop approaches based on robust and systematic programme theo-	54.0	325.94000244140625	9.9599609375	486.6968994140625	6
ries. However, even if systematic and robust evidence is produced for the relative effectiveness of certain types of pro-	54.0	338.17999267578125	9.959991455078125	486.735595703125	6

programmes have an inevitably individualist perspective. Further, as participation in sport is closely related to socially	54.0	374.77996826171875	9.959991455078125	487.17523193359375	6

clusion may precede such participation. In this regard academics and researchers need to adopt a degree of scepticism	54.0	399.1399841308594	9.959991455078125	487.0660400390625	6
