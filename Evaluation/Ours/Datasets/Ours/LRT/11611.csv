This paper considers merger control in a common agency framework where firms and	85.08001708984375	183.8836669921875	12.0	425.2846984863281	3
their competitors can influence the antitrust agency and where transparency – while	85.08001708984375	198.8836669921875	12.0	425.374755859375	3
making lobbying less effective – also implies real resource costs. We examine the	85.08001708984375	213.8836669921875	12.0	425.2667541503906	3
performance of two alternative standards that can be assigned to the antitrust agency in	85.08001708984375	228.8836669921875	12.0	425.23193359375	3
the presence of these regulatory failures. We find that under a welfare standard,	85.08001708984375	243.8836669921875	12.0	425.1287536621094	3
lobbying leads to the clearance of relatively inefficient mergers that decrease welfare	85.08001708984375	258.8836669921875	12.0	425.1828308105469	3
(i. e. there is a type II error). By contrast, under a consumer surplus standard, the agency	85.08001708984375	273.8836669921875	12.0	425.3039245605469	3
will ban relatively efficient mergers that would increase welfare (i. e. there is a type I	85.08001708984375	288.8836669921875	12.0	425.4265441894531	3
error). Lobbying actually reduces the extent to which this occurs, albeit at a cost in	85.08001708984375	303.8836669921875	12.0	425.38671875	3
terms of real resources. We also find that a consumer surplus standard is more attractive	85.08001708984375	318.8836669921875	12.0	425.3711853027344	3
when mergers are large, when increasing the size of a merger greatly enhances industry	85.08001708984375	333.8836669921875	12.0	425.4263000488281	3
profits, when there is little transparency, and when co-ordination costs amongst	85.08001708984375	348.8836669921875	12.0	425.2572937011719	3

Benutzt die Fusionsbehörde ein Wohlfahrtskriterium führt Lobbying seitens der	85.08001708984375	559.8436889648438	12.0	425.1900329589844	6

Introduction	103.9171142578125	90.82269287109375	17.39996337890625	106.86381530761719	10
The purpose of this paper is to evaluate alternative objectives that can be assigned to	74.87999725341797	123.57781982421875	12.0	446.53064727783203	11
an antitrust agency in charge of merger control. It is striking that some of the major	74.87999725341797	140.97784423828125	12.0	446.57398223876953	11
antitrust agencies actually operate with objectives that diﬀer from welfare maximisa-	74.87999725341797	158.25787353515625	12.0	446.45398712158203	11
tion. For instance, Art. 2 of the merger regulation stipulates that the merger task force	74.8800048828125	175.65789794921875	12.0	446.36639404296875	11
should be solely concerned about restrictions of competition and that eﬃciency beneÞts	74.8800048828125	192.93792724609375	12.0	446.44561767578125	11
should only be taken into account in so far as consumers are not hurt. Hence, it would	74.87997436523438	210.21795654296875	12.0	446.4528503417969	11
appear that the merger regulation is concerned about consumer surplus and not aggre-	74.87997436523438	227.61798095703125	12.0	446.4324035644531	11
gate welfare. The US antitrust legislation has a similar bias in favour of consumers (see	74.87997436523438	244.89801025390625	12.0	446.3627624511719	11
e.g. Gellhorn and Kovacic, 1994).	74.87997436523438	262.29803466796875	12.0	171.8135986328125	11
In a world with no regulatory failures, excluding Þrms proÞts from the objectives	92.39997863769531	279.57806396484375	12.0	428.91856384277344	11
assigned to the antitrust authority would seem hard to justify on eﬃciency grounds.	74.8800048828125	296.97808837890625	12.0	446.4912109375	11
However, in the presence of regulatory failures a systematic bias in favour of a particular	74.8800048828125	314.25811767578125	12.0	446.60150146484375	11
interest may occur. In this context, it may be desirable for the public authority (the	74.8800048828125	331.6581115722656	12.0	446.4349365234375	11
ultimate principal) to manipulate the objective function of the antitrust agency so as	74.8800048828125	348.9381103515625	12.0	446.40576171875	11
to compensate for the bias ex ante. For instance, an explicit emphasis on consumer	74.8800048828125	366.3381042480469	12.0	446.54644775390625	11
surplus, possibly a full truncation of the objective of the antitrust agency so that proÞts	74.8800048828125	383.61810302734375	12.0	446.44561767578125	11
are ignored, may be appropriate. That is, decisions taken according to a consumer	74.87997436523438	400.8981018066406	12.0	446.5594787597656	11
surplus standard may actually lead to higher welfare than those taken according to a	74.87997436523438	418.298095703125	12.0	446.4466247558594	11
welfare standard.	74.87997436523438	435.5780944824219	12.0	87.92640686035156	11
This paper considers the regulatory failures associated with the inßuences that can	92.39997863769531	452.97808837890625	12.0	428.91831970214844	11
be brought to bear on an antitrust agency in charge of merger control1. We consider	74.87997436523438	469.037841796875	13.220245361328125	446.5536193847656	11
a common agency framework (à la Bernheim and Whinston, 1986) in which interested	74.8800048828125	487.6578063964844	12.0	446.486328125	11
parties can provide inducements to the antitrust agency which are contingent on the	74.8800048828125	504.93780517578125	12.0	446.397705078125	11
outcome of the merger review. We characterise the contingent perks that Þrms will	74.8800048828125	522.3377685546875	12.0	446.49603271484375	11
provide and the decisions that will be taken by the antitrust agency for a distribution of	74.88003540039062	539.6177978515625	12.0	446.4659729003906	11
possible mergers and for alternative objectives that can be assigned to the agency. We	74.88003540039062	557.017822265625	12.0	446.4443054199219	11
then compare the advantages and drawbacks of alternative objectives.	74.88003540039062	574.2977905273438	12.0	358.7665100097656	11
In particular, we consider a model with four stages. In the Þrst stage, the government	92.40003967285156	591.69775390625	12.0	428.9821014404297	11
decides on the objective that it will assign to the antitrust agency. We focus on two	74.88006591796875	608.977783203125	12.0	446.5703125	11
alternative objectives, namely welfare and consumer surplus2.	74.88006591796875	625.037841796875	13.219970703125	315.81591796875	11
1Besanko and Spulber (1993) consider a model where regulatory failures arise from asymmetric	88.31999969482422	647.9851684570312	11.334274291992188	432.95789337158203	12
information regarding the characteristics of the merger, known by the merging Þrms but not the antitrust	74.88009643554688	663.6397094726562	10.080001831054688	446.3525085449219	12
agency. They also evaluate alternative objective functions that the government might assign to the	74.88009643554688	677.9200439453125	10.080001831054688	446.2920227050781	12
antitrust agency. They Þnd that the optimal rule should give more weight to consumer surplus than	74.88009643554688	692.3203735351562	10.080001831054688	446.4975891113281	12
proÞts.	74.88008880615234	706.6006469726562	10.079994201660156	30.520217895507812	12
2We focus on these polar cases (rather than consider a continuum of objective functions characterised	88.31999969482422	718.065185546875	11.334152221679688	433.15149688720703	12

In the second stage, a merger is notiÞed and the interested parties provide contin-	92.4000015258789	94.41778564453125	12.0	428.8740463256836	14
gent bids. We consider three interested parties, namely consumers, the merging Þrms	74.88002014160156	111.81781005859375	12.0	446.4468231201172	14
and their competitors. However, we assume that consumers are unable to lobby the	74.88003540039062	129.09783935546875	12.0	446.3929138183594	14
antitrust agency. This may arise for at least two reasons. First, consumers may not	74.88003540039062	146.37786865234375	12.0	446.4972229003906	14
be well informed about the consequences of proposed mergers and accordingly may not	74.88003540039062	163.77789306640625	12.0	446.4864807128906	14
be able to formulate appropriate contingent bids. Second, consumers may face pro-	74.88003540039062	181.05792236328125	12.0	446.4322204589844	14
hibitive transaction costs in representing their interests. These costs could be associated	74.88003540039062	198.45794677734375	12.0	446.4407043457031	14
with the traditional problems of free-riding and collective action with numerous agents.	74.88003540039062	215.73797607421875	12.0	446.5019836425781	14
The assumption that consumers are underrepresented in merger review also seems to	74.88003540039062	233.13800048828125	12.0	446.5104675292969	14
be broadly consistent with casual observation (for instance, consumer organisations are	74.88003540039062	250.41802978515625	12.0	446.4601135253906	14
seldom represented in merger hearings).	74.88003540039062	267.81805419921875	12.0	204.09603881835938	14
In the third stage, the antitrust agency (the common agent) decides whether or not	92.40003967285156	285.09808349609375	12.0	428.9364471435547	14
to allow the proposed mergers on the basis of its assigned objective and the contingent	74.88003540039062	302.49810791015625	12.0	446.4670104980469	14
perks by the interested parties (the principals). In line with the literature on political	74.88003540039062	319.77813720703125	12.0	446.4349670410156	14
economy interactions in a common agency framework (see for instance Grossman and	74.88003540039062	337.0581359863281	12.0	446.4841003417969	14
Helpman, 1994), we do not explicitly model how the actions of the antitrust agency	74.88003540039062	354.4581298828125	12.0	446.4012756347656	14
could be monitored by the government. Rather, we simply assume that the agency	74.88003540039062	371.7381286621094	12.0	446.5379943847656	14
is subject to imperfect accountability and can compromise the pursuit of its mission	74.88003540039062	389.13812255859375	12.0	446.4971008300781	14
while responding to perks. Unlike the previous literature, we explicitly consider the	74.88003540039062	406.4181213378906	12.0	446.4901428222656	14
eﬀect of accountability. In particular, when the agency is accountable, only a fraction	74.88003540039062	423.818115234375	12.0	446.5368347167969	14
of what Þrms spend in lobbying will aﬀect the agencys behaviour, so that with greater	74.88003540039062	441.0981140136719	12.0	446.5895080566406	14
accountability the agency will be more diﬃcult to inßuence. Moreover, we assume that	74.88002014160156	458.49810791015625	12.0	446.5115203857422	14
the share of Þrms bid which does not aﬀect the agencys behaviour is pure social waste.	74.87997436523438	475.7781066894531	12.0	446.4936218261719	14
This assumption is is meant to represent the fact that with greater transparency inßuence	74.87997436523438	493.1781005859375	12.0	446.4419860839844	14
has to take indirect routes which are typically less eﬃcient than a direct transfer. For	74.87994384765625	510.4581298828125	12.0	446.54278564453125	14
instance, when bribes can be monitored by the government, inßuences will take place	74.87994384765625	527.8580932617188	12.0	446.45281982421875	14
through indirect means like expensive lunches or the promise of lucrative jobs in the	74.87994384765625	545.1380615234375	12.0	446.44317626953125	14
private sectors (the revolving door). Whereas pure transfers do not entail any eﬃciency	74.87994384765625	562.4180908203125	12.0	446.50079345703125	14
losses, indirect means of inßuencing the agency typically involve some real resource cost.	74.87994384765625	579.818115234375	12.0	446.523681640625	14
Hence, while greater transparency polices the behaviour of the agency, it also involves	74.87992858886719	597.0980834960938	12.0	446.5597686767578	14
some real resource costs. We also assume that lobbying by competitors is relatively less	74.87992858886719	614.498046875	12.0	446.36622619628906	14
eﬃcient than lobbying by merging Þrms simply because competitors are more numerous	74.87992858886719	631.778076171875	12.0	446.3449249267578	14
and hence incur some co-ordination cost. As a result we allow for co-ordination costs	74.87992858886719	649.1781005859375	12.0	446.5248565673828	14
amongst competitors that are increasing in the number of competing Þrms.	74.87992858886719	666.4580688476562	12.0	385.8948211669922	14
In the Þnal stage, product market competition takes place. In equilibrium, Þrms	92.39993286132812	683.8580322265625	12.0	428.9267883300781	14

proÞts that will accrue from the outcome of this decision.	74.87999725341797	94.41778564453125	12.0	294.8807144165039	17
The proÞts that merging Þrms and their competitors anticipate as a result of any	92.39999389648438	111.81781005859375	12.0	428.9280090332031	17

the merger. For our purposes, we do not need to specify the market game explicitly,	74.8799819946289	146.37786865234375	12.0	446.55013275146484	17
but rather make some general monotonicity assumptions on the reduced form proÞt	74.8799819946289	163.77789306640625	12.0	446.50801849365234	17
function of the merging Þrms and their competitors, as well as consumer surplus. In	74.87997436523438	181.05792236328125	12.0	446.4997253417969	17
particular, we assume that the proÞts of the merging Þrms, the consumer surplus and	74.87997436523438	198.45794677734375	12.0	446.4455871582031	17
welfare increase monotonically with the eﬃciency gains achieved by the merger, while	74.8800048828125	215.73797607421875	12.0	446.48876953125	17
the proÞts of competitors decrease monotonically. These assumptions are reasonable	74.8800048828125	233.13800048828125	12.0	446.42156982421875	17
and hold for Cournot with homogenous products. We also assume that larger mergers	74.8800048828125	250.41802978515625	12.0	446.38677978515625	17
always enhance industry proÞts but reduce welfare.	74.8800048828125	267.81805419921875	12.0	262.8948669433594	17
For both of the agencys objective functions (i.e. welfare and consumer surplus), we	92.4000244140625	285.09808349609375	12.0	428.89178466796875	17
characterise the equilibrium and the associated welfare (ex post) for a range of possible	74.88002014160156	302.49810791015625	12.0	446.4488983154297	17
mergers characterised by diﬀerent eﬃciency levels. We Þnd that under a welfare standard	74.88002014160156	319.77813720703125	12.0	446.4300994873047	17
the agency will allow relatively ineﬃcient mergers that decreases welfare (there is a	74.88003540039062	337.0581359863281	12.0	446.5091857910156	17
type II error). In those circumstances, there is also some social waste associated with	74.88003540039062	354.4581298828125	12.0	446.4768981933594	17
lobbying by the merging Þrms and their competitors. By contrast, when the agency	74.88003540039062	371.7381286621094	12.0	446.5234680175781	17
operates with a consumer surplus standard, it will ban relatively eﬃcient mergers that	74.88003540039062	389.13812255859375	12.0	446.5056457519531	17
would increase welfare (there is a type I error). In addition, there is range of mergers	74.88003540039062	406.4181213378906	12.0	446.4132995605469	17
which display even higher eﬃciency which are only allowed because of lobbying. In	74.88003540039062	423.818115234375	12.0	446.4720153808594	17
those circumstances, there is some social waste associated with lobbying but no decision	74.88003540039062	441.0981140136719	12.0	446.4720764160156	17
error. Overall, lobbying still appears to be desirable under a consumer surplus standard	74.88003540039062	458.49810791015625	12.0	446.3831481933594	17
because lobbying re-balances the objective function of the antitrust agency in favour of	74.88003540039062	475.7781066894531	12.0	446.4154357910156	17
Þrms. Looking at the relative costs and beneÞts of the alternative standards, we observe	74.88003540039062	493.1781005859375	12.0	446.4216003417969	17
that a consumer surplus standard is more attractive when mergers are large, when	74.88005065917969	510.4581298828125	12.0	446.3937530517578	17
increasing the size of a merger greatly enhances industry proÞts, and when transparency	74.88005065917969	527.8580932617188	12.0	446.4635772705078	17

We consider an industry with N Þrms. A merger in this industry is characterised by the	74.87999725341797	670.6577758789062	12.3822021484375	446.40845489501953	20

The structure of the game is illustrated in Figure 1. In stage 1 the government	92.4000015258789	94.41778564453125	12.0	428.9759750366211	22
assigns a standard to the antitrust agency. It can choose either a welfare standard or a	74.8800048828125	111.81781005859375	12.0	446.4744873046875	22
consumer surplus standard. The objective function of the government is the change in	74.8800048828125	129.09783935546875	12.0	446.4119873046875	22

where Πm is the change in aggregate proÞts accruing to the merging Þrms, Πc is the	74.87997436523438	239.73779296875	13.07440185546875	446.4456481933594	25
change in aggregate proÞts to the competing Þrms, CS is the change in consumer surplus,	74.8800048828125	257.017822265625	12.3822021484375	446.4803466796875	25

the agency, respectively. Note that if the merger is banned, the change in proÞts and	74.87997436523438	291.69781494140625	12.0	446.4551696777344	25
consumer surplus is simply zero.	74.87994384765625	308.97784423828125	12.0	165.82681274414062	25
We assume that the process of lobbying involves two types of ineﬃciencies. First, a	92.39994812011719	326.37786865234375	11.999969482421875	428.99403381347656	25
fraction (1 − α) of the bids paid by the merging Þrms and its competitors are wasted.	74.87997436523438	343.6578369140625	16.04962158203125	446.4875793457031	25
As discussed above, a high share of waste corresponds to an environment with high	74.8800048828125	361.0578308105469	12.0	446.425048828125	25
transparency so that Þrms have to resort to indirect and ineﬃcient means of inßuencing	74.8800048828125	378.33782958984375	12.0	446.51397705078125	25
the government. Second, we also assume that lobbying by competitors is relatively less	74.87997436523438	395.7378234863281	12.0	446.4301452636719	25
eﬃcient than lobbying by merging Þrms simply because competitors are more numerous	74.87997436523438	413.017822265625	12.0	446.3449401855469	25
and hence incur some co-ordination cost. The waste associated with co-ordination is	74.87998962402344	430.4178161621094	12.0	446.4445343017578	25
captured by the term ε(N − M ), where we assume that the co-ordination costs are	74.87998962402344	447.69781494140625	16.04962158203125	446.4311065673828	25
increasing in the number of competing Þrms3 N − M , i.e. ε0(N − M ) > 0. Let us also	74.8800048828125	463.7578430175781	17.269561767578125	446.52001953125	25
denote β = α − ε(N − M ) as the share of the bid paid by the competitors which is pure	74.8800048828125	482.3777770996094	16.04962158203125	446.39996337890625	25

In stage 2, Þrms provide contingent bids to the agency. The objective function of the	92.40000915527344	528.937744140625	12.0	428.91725158691406	26
Þrms are the changes in their net proÞt, namely the change in their proÞt (as deÞned	74.88001251220703	546.3377685546875	12.0	446.4600143432617	26

In other words, the agency maximises the sum of the change in welfare associated with	74.87999725341797	94.41778564453125	12.0	446.4489212036133	31
the merger and the eﬀective bids (the share of the bid which is not wasted). As discussed	74.87999725341797	111.81781005859375	12.0	446.4517288208008	31

We do not explicitly specify the market game but assume that the following properties	92.4000244140625	463.17779541015625	12.0	428.95086669921875	40

Hence, we assume that the proÞtability of a merger increases with the level of eﬃ-	92.39999389648438	596.977783203125	12.0	428.9159851074219	45
ciency that it can achieve. The proÞts of competitors fall with this level of eﬃciency	74.8800048828125	614.3778076171875	12.0	446.50079345703125	45
but the industry proÞt still rises. We also assume that as the eﬃciency gains increase,	74.8800048828125	631.6577758789062	12.0	446.48162841796875	45
the equilibrium price falls so that the consumer surplus increases. These assumptions	74.8800048828125	649.0577392578125	12.0	446.45745849609375	45
imply that welfare increases in line with the eﬃciency gain. It is straightforward but te-	74.8800048828125	666.3377685546875	12.0	446.406005859375	45
dious to check that these properties actually hold for a Cournot model with homogenous	74.8800048828125	683.73779296875	12.0	446.4588623046875	45

The last two assumptions restrict our analysis to situations where larger mergers	92.4000015258789	94.41778564453125	12.0	428.93770599365234	48
increase industry proÞts and reduce welfare. These assumptions accord with intuition	74.8800048828125	111.81781005859375	12.0	446.45001220703125	48
and should hold for a wide variety of market models.	74.8800048828125	129.09783935546875	12.0	271.2936096191406	48
Beyond our maintained assumptions about the proÞt function A1-A4, we further	92.40000915527344	146.37786865234375	12.0	429.0000762939453	48
assume that the competitors (whose proÞt fall with eﬃciency) and the consumers (whose	74.88003540039062	163.77789306640625	12.0	446.4504699707031	48
surplus increase with eﬃciency) are indiﬀerent for an identical value of the eﬃciency gain	74.88006591796875	181.05792236328125	12.0	446.471923828125	48
denoted by e0. In other words, ∃e0 > 0, s.t. Πc∗(e0) = CS∗(e0) = 0. This property does not	74.88006591796875	198.45782470703125	16.04962158203125	446.50067138671875	48
appear to be unduly restrictive since it accords with intuition that when the equilibrium	74.8800048828125	215.73785400390625	12.0	446.60028076171875	48
price is unaﬀected by the merger, competitors should also be unaﬀected. Again, one can	74.8800048828125	233.13787841796875	12.0	446.49603271484375	48
check that this property actually holds for a Cournot model with homogenous products	74.88003540039062	250.41790771484375	12.0	446.4325256347656	48
(see Bond, 1994). Finally, we assume the merging parties are rational and restrict	74.88003540039062	267.81793212890625	12.0	446.5476989746094	48
attention to the range of eﬃciency parameters which ensure that mergers are proÞtable	74.8800277709961	285.09796142578125	12.0	446.4456558227539	48
(i.e. such that Π∗m > 0).	74.8800048828125	302.497802734375	14.27447509765625	122.61358642578125	48
The impact that a merger has on the interests of merging Þrms, competitors and	92.39998626708984	319.77783203125	12.0	428.8870620727539	48
consumers under these assumptions is presented graphically in Figure 2, as a function	74.8800048828125	337.0578308105469	12.0	446.43450927734375	48
of the eﬃciency achieved by the merger (holding constant the number of Þrms as well as	74.8800048828125	354.45782470703125	12.0	446.45037841796875	48
the number of merging Þrms). Note that consumers and the competing Þrms never have	74.8800048828125	371.7378234863281	12.0	446.44677734375	48
congruent interests. When eﬃciency is such that the price increases after the merger,	74.8800048828125	389.1378173828125	12.0	446.51751708984375	48
the interests of the merging Þrms and their competitors are aligned. By contrast, when	74.8800048828125	406.4178161621094	12.0	446.44891357421875	48
eﬃciency is large enough to guarantee that the price falls, the merging Þrms beneÞt from	74.88002014160156	423.81781005859375	12.0	446.55003356933594	48
the mergers and become the allies of consumers, against the interest of competitors.	74.88003540039062	441.0978088378906	12.0	430.4712829589844	48
For further reference, it is also useful to deÞne the eﬃciency level which guarantees	92.40003967285156	470.3778076171875	12.0	428.9614715576172	49
that the change in total welfare is unaﬀected by the merger. Denote the change in	74.88003540039062	487.7778015136719	12.0	446.4203796386719	49
welfare at a given eﬃciency gain by S∼∗(e) = Πc∗(e) + Π∗m(e) + CS∗(e). Note that by	74.8800048828125	500.281494140625	19.1707763671875	446.48876953125	49
∼	137.27999877929688	519.121337890625	8.040008544921875	6.6410369873046875	49
A1 and A2 S(e) is increasing in e. DeÞne the eﬃciency level at which total welfare is	74.8800048828125	523.8978271484375	12.3822021484375	446.387939453125	49
unchanged by the merger as ∼e such that S∼∗(∼e) = 0 (see also Figure 2).	74.88003540039062	537.84130859375	17.15869140625	361.5419616699219	49
Note that the change in welfare at e is positive, since Πc∗(e0) = CS∗(e0) = 0 and	92.39999389648438	559.8978271484375	14.394378662109375	428.9375915527344	49
Π∗m(e0) > 0. The last inequality holds, since at an eﬃciency level of e0, price and output	74.8800048828125	577.2977905273438	14.274734497070312	446.49969482421875	49
are unaﬀected by the merger. Total revenues are thus unaﬀected but total costs fall in	74.8800048828125	594.5777587890625	12.0	446.48406982421875	49
line with the eﬃciency gain so that the change in proÞts has to be positive. Furthermore,	74.8800048828125	611.977783203125	12.0	446.52850341796875	49
given the monotonicity of welfare (through A1 and A2) , we also have that ∼e < e0.	74.87997436523438	627.4813232421875	14.15869140625	421.7760314941406	49
Our assumptions with respect to the size of the merger (A3 and A4) can also be	92.4000244140625	646.6578369140625	12.0	428.91357421875	49
illustrated in Figure 2. A4 implies that the sum of Þrms proÞts is shifted upwards for	74.88002014160156	663.9378051757812	12.0	446.5306854248047	49
larger mergers. By A3, consumer surplus is shifted downwards and the eﬃciency level	74.87997436523438	681.2177734375	12.0	446.5139465332031	49

In stage 3 the agency decides on the merger. The decision of the authority is either to	74.87999725341797	119.497802734375	12.0	446.5835647583008	53
ban (D = 0) or to allow (D = 1) the merger (no remedies are allowed). In order to avoid	74.87999725341797	136.77783203125	12.3822021484375	446.45642852783203	53
unessential complexities, we assume that if the agency is indiﬀerent between allowing	74.88002014160156	154.1778564453125	12.0	446.4923553466797	53
and prohibiting a merger, it will decide to allow it. The equilibrium at this stage is	74.8800048828125	171.4578857421875	12.0	446.43353271484375	53
straightforward: the agency simply compares the levels of utility that it achieves under	74.8800048828125	188.85791015625	12.0	446.59222412109375	53
each outcome and selects the outcome that yields the highest level.	74.8800048828125	206.137939453125	12.0	344.18896484375	53
Formally, the equilibrium is described as follows. Consider Þrst the welfare standard.	92.40000915527344	223.5379638671875	12.0	428.97962951660156	53
In this case, the agencies utility if they allow the merger is given by (2), i.e. U1(D = 1) =	74.88003540039062	240.8179931640625	13.19219970703125	446.4131774902344	53
Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ + αFm(D = 1) + (α − ε(N − M ))Fc(D = 1). Similarly, the utility if the	74.8800048828125	258.2177734375	16.04962158203125	446.46734619140625	53
agency blocks the merger is given by U1(D = 0) = αFm(D = 0) +(α −ε(N −M ))Fc(D =	74.88003540039062	275.497802734375	16.04962158203125	446.4119567871094	53
0). For the consumer surplus standard, the agencies utility if they allow the merger is	74.8800048828125	292.77783203125	12.3822021484375	446.47662353515625	53
given by (3), i.e. U2(D = 1) = CS∗ + αFm(D = 1) + (α − ε(N − M ))Fc(D = 1),	74.8800048828125	310.17779541015625	16.04962158203125	446.4959716796875	53
while the utility if the agency blocks the merger is given by U2(D = 0) = αFm(D =	74.87997436523438	327.45782470703125	13.194488525390625	446.4120178222656	53

We derive equilibrium bids for both welfare and consumer surplus standards. Note that	74.87999725341797	498.93780517578125	12.0	446.5380325317383	57
the bids are contingent on the actions of the antitrust agency. We therefore need to	74.87999725341797	516.2177734375	12.0	446.43726348876953	57
consider Þrms incentives to bid against and in favor of the merger being allowed. We	74.87999725341797	533.497802734375	12.0	446.4191360473633	57
begin with the welfare standard.	74.87998962402344	550.8978271484375	12.0	166.2083740234375	57

Assume that the agency is assigned the welfare standard. In order to solve for the	74.87998962402344	609.0977783203125	12.0	446.4298858642578	60
equilibrium bids, it is convenient to distinguish among various parameter regions with	74.87998962402344	626.497802734375	12.0	446.51173400878906	60
respect to the eﬃciency level. As noted above, when e < e0, both the merging Þrms	74.87998962402344	643.77783203125	12.3822021484375	446.4468536376953	60
and their competitors beneÞt from the merger and hence will never bid to inßuence the	74.8800048828125	661.1777954101562	12.0	446.4383544921875	60
antitrust authority against the merger. We therefore have Fm(D = 0) = Fc(D = 0) = 0.	74.8800048828125	678.457763671875	13.194595336914062	446.49603271484375	60

Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ ≥ U1(D = 0) = 0. Therefore in equilibrium Þrms will not bid. Q.E.D.	74.87997436523438	140.8577880859375	16.04962158203125	441.8160705566406	63
In this region, the eﬃciency of the merger is such that welfare does not fall. Hence,	92.39999389648438	163.89776611328125	12.0	428.9470520019531	64
Þrms do not have to bid in order to inßuence the antitrust agency, which allows the	74.87998962402344	181.17779541015625	12.0	446.45143127441406	64
merger without any inducement.	74.8800048828125	198.57781982421875	12.0	166.75318908691406	64
Let us now focus on eﬃciency level below ∼e. In this region, the change in welfare is	92.40000915527344	214.0814208984375	14.1585693359375	428.9545440673828	64
negative and Þrms (which beneÞt from the merger) will have to provide incentive to the	74.8800048828125	233.2578125	12.0	446.45379638671875	64
agency if they want the merger to be allowed. Given the decision of the agency in stage	74.87998962402344	250.537841796875	12.0	446.48634338378906	64
3, Þrms will have to ensure that U1(D = 1) ≥ 0. Consider the highest amount that Þrms	74.87998962402344	267.93780517578125	16.04962158203125	446.4468536376953	64
can bid, i.e. their entire proÞt. The resulting value of the utility of the agency if the	74.88003540039062	285.21783447265625	12.0	446.4253234863281	64
merger is allowed is then given by S1∗(e) = Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ + αΠ∗m + (α − ε(N − M ))Πc∗.	74.88002014160156	302.497802734375	16.04962158203125	446.49595642089844	64
Let e∗1 be the eﬃciency level such that such that S1∗(e1∗) = 0.	74.87997436523438	319.8978271484375	14.39239501953125	308.49603271484375	64
Lemma 2 For e < e∗1, Þrms will not bid and the merger is blocked. For e∗1 ≤ e < ∼e,	74.8800048828125	347.281494140625	17.7059326171875	446.4840087890625	65
Þrms bid such that U1(D = 1) = 0 and the merger is allowed.	74.87997436523438	366.340087890625	13.190216064453125	313.3895568847656	65
Proof : Note that S1∗(e) is monotonically increasing and continuous in e by A1 and	92.39997863769531	395.3778076171875	14.392425537109375	428.93760681152344	66
A2. Since S1∗(∼e) > 0, we have that e∗1 < ∼e and that e∗1 is unique and it exists (assuming	74.8800048828125	411.0014953613281	16.0489501953125	446.5079345703125	66
that S1∗(e) < 0 for some possibly negative e). Let e < e∗1 such that S1∗(e) < 0, which	74.8800048828125	430.05780029296875	14.3924560546875	446.46240234375	66
implies that U1(D = 1) < 0 for the maximum bids. Therefore, the merger is blocked	74.87994384765625	447.4577941894531	13.1925048828125	446.38922119140625	66
and it is optimal for Þrms not to bid. Let e∗1 < e < ∼e, which implies that S1∗(e) > 0.	74.87997436523438	462.9613952636719	16.168853759765625	446.4960021972656	66
Any pair of bids Fm(D = 1), Fc(D = 1) such that U1(D = 1) = 0 is an equilibrium. The	74.87997436523438	482.1377868652344	13.194549560546875	446.4528503417969	66
merger is allowed. Q.E.D.	74.88003540039062	499.41778564453125	12.0	132.73562622070312	66
Hence, whenever eﬃciency is insuﬃcient to guarantee that the merger will increase	92.40003967285156	522.457763671875	12.0	428.9125213623047	67
welfare, Þrms have to provide incentives to the agency in order to have the merger	74.88003540039062	539.73779296875	12.0	446.5345764160156	67
waved through. However, the proÞt of the merging Þrms and its competitors increase	74.88003540039062	557.1378173828125	12.0	446.4216613769531	67
in line with the level of eﬃciency. There is thus a range of eﬃciency parameter (below	74.88006591796875	574.4177856445312	12.0	446.54864501953125	67
that which guarantees no change in welfare) for which Þrms have suﬃcient proÞt to	74.88003540039062	591.8177490234375	12.0	446.5152282714844	67
provide adequate incentives to the antitrust agency. In this region, we consequently	74.88006591796875	609.0977783203125	12.0	446.4178466796875	67
have two types of ineﬃciencies, which occur simultaneously. The Þrst one arises because	74.88006591796875	626.497802734375	12.0	446.45635986328125	67
the merger is pushed through by the lobbying activity of Þrms, even though it reduces	74.88006591796875	643.7777709960938	12.0	446.43487548828125	67
welfare. We therefore have a type II error. In addition, there is bidding in equilibrium	74.88006591796875	661.177734375	12.0	446.57879638671875	67
and this entails some waste.	74.88006591796875	678.457763671875	12.0	143.40606689453125	67
It is worth noting at this point that the agency does not obtain any rent from the	92.40007019042969	695.8577880859375	12.0	428.87635803222656	67
political economy interactions because Þrms always provide just enough incentives to	74.88006591796875	713.1377563476562	12.0	446.55010986328125	67
make the antitrust agency indiﬀerent between allowing and prohibiting the merger. It is	74.88006591796875	730.417724609375	12.0	446.416748046875	67
8	295.0
indeed a standard feature of equilibrium in common agency games that the agent obtains	74.87999725341797	94.41778564453125	12.0	446.42285919189453	69
positive rents from the interactions only if the principals have divergent interests (see	74.87999725341797	111.81781005859375	12.0	446.48157501220703	69
for instance Grossman and Helpman, 1994).	74.87999725341797	129.09783935546875	12.0	225.21356964111328	69
We now consider the region where the incentives of the Þrms are not aligned, i.e.	92.39999389648438	152.37786865234375	12.0	428.9304504394531	70
when e is above e0.	74.8800048828125	169.77777099609375	12.38232421875	96.33599853515625	70
Lemma 3 For e > e0, the merger is allowed. In equilibrium the merging Þrms bid	74.8800048828125	200.02008056640625	12.42938232421875	446.53082275390625	71
Fm(D = 1) = max{0, −βΠc∗ − (Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗)}.	74.8800048828125	217.42010498046875	16.04730224609375	255.323974609375	71
Proof : Given that competitors are hurt by the merger we must have that Fc(D =	92.39999389648438	247.65777587890625	13.1944580078125	428.8919982910156	72
1) = 0, which implies that the agency will allow the merger when U1(D = 1) = Π∗m +	74.8800048828125	264.93780517578125	14.39447021484375	446.4119873046875	72
Πc∗ + CS∗ + αFm(D = 1) ≥ U1(D = 0) = βFc(D = 0). Note that by A1, we have that	74.8800048828125	282.3377685546875	16.04962158203125	446.50799560546875	72
Π∗m > −Πc∗, which implies that in equilibrium Fm(D = 1) < Π∗m, i.e. the merging Þrms	74.8800048828125	299.6177978515625	16.04962158203125	446.44683837890625	72
are always able to push the merger through. Assume that Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ < −βΠc∗ so	74.8800048828125	317.017822265625	16.04962158203125	446.52001953125	72
that competitors could have the merger prohibited in the absence of bid by the merging	74.8800048828125	334.2978210449219	12.0	446.5283203125	72
Þrms. Fm(D = 1) = −βΠc∗ −(Π∗m +Πc∗ +CS∗) is then a best reply to Fc(D = 0) = −βΠc∗	74.8800048828125	351.6977844238281	16.04962158203125	445.86920166015625	72
. Fc(D = 0) = −βΠc∗ is a (weak) best reply to Fm(D = 1) = −βΠc∗ − (Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗).	74.87999725341797	368.977783203125	16.04962158203125	446.42395782470703	72
In equilibrium, the maximum bid of the competing Þrms is neutralized by the merging	74.87997436523438	386.3777770996094	12.0	446.4995422363281	72
Þrms. Next, assume that Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ > −βΠc∗. Then Fm(D = 1) = 0 is an	74.87997436523438	403.65777587890625	16.049652099609375	446.4623718261719	72
equilibrium since the maximum bid of the competing Þrms can not block the merger.	74.8800048828125	421.05780029296875	12.0	446.51885986328125	72
Furthermore, any contingent bid by competitors Fc(D = 0) is a best reply. Q.E.D.	74.88003540039062	438.3377990722656	13.19451904296875	422.8643493652344	72
In this region, the level of eﬃciency is such that competitors are harmed by the	92.4000244140625	461.6177978515625	12.0	428.88824462890625	73
merger and would want to inßuence the antitrust agency to block it. We therefore have	74.88002014160156	479.0177917480469	12.0	446.4143524169922	73
opposing interests on the part of the Þrms. In principle, the competitors might lose more	74.8800048828125	496.29779052734375	12.0	446.40252685546875	73
from the mergers than what the merger entails in terms of welfare gains, i.e. is possible	74.8800048828125	513.69775390625	12.0	446.51641845703125	73
that Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ < −βΠc∗. In this case, where competitors are badly hurt by a	74.8800048828125	530.977783203125	16.04962158203125	446.52960205078125	73
merger, they are capable to compensate the agency for the loss of welfare that would	74.8800048828125	548.3778076171875	12.0	446.43231201171875	73
arise if the merger is prohibited. However, as the above lemma shows, the merging Þrms	74.8800048828125	565.6577758789062	12.0	446.44683837890625	73
are always able to neutralize the bids by the competitors, which implies that the merger	74.88003540039062	582.937744140625	12.0	446.5295715332031	73
will always go through. The agency does not make an error but there is a social cost	74.88003540039062	600.3377685546875	12.0	446.5501403808594	73
associated with lobbying. When the maximum bid of the competitors could not overturn	74.88003540039062	617.6177978515625	12.0	446.4947814941406	73
the merger even if the merging Þrms do not bid (Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ < −βΠc∗), the merging	74.88003540039062	635.0177612304688	16.0496826171875	446.5367736816406	73
Þrms do not bid and there is no waste.	74.8800048828125	652.2977905273438	12.0	198.77044677734375	73
In sum, we Þnd that relative to the adjacent parameter range (i.e. to the left of e0),	92.40000915527344	669.69775390625	12.38226318359375	428.97596740722656	73
the emergence of opposing interests among Þrms does not change the outcome of the	74.87997436523438	686.977783203125	12.0	446.4516906738281	73

When there is no interest which dominates, the merging Þrms, which can always trump	74.87997436523438	721.6578369140625	12.0	446.4276428222656	73

We now turn to the alternative standard.	92.39999389648438	129.09783935546875	12.0	211.72799682617188	75

Assume that the agency is assigned the consumer surplus standard. As before, we Þrst	74.87998962402344	188.25787353515625	12.0	446.50685119628906	78
focus on the parameter region for which Þrms incentives are aligned (e ≤ e0), such that	74.88003540039062	205.53778076171875	16.04974365234375	446.5007629394531	78
Fm(D = 0) = Fc(D = 0) = 0. We Þrst consider the region such that e ≤ ∼e, i.e. where	74.87997436523438	221.16143798828125	17.82598876953125	446.4468078613281	78
eﬃciency is not suﬃcient to guarantee that the change in welfare is positive.	74.8800048828125	240.21783447265625	12.0	392.0063171386719	78
Lemma 4 Let e ≤ ∼e. Firms will not bid and the merger is blocked.	74.88001251220703	268.8013916015625	17.7060546875	346.5310592651367	79
Proof: The agency will allow the merger iﬀ U2(D = 1) = CS∗ + αFm(D = 1) + (α −	92.4000015258789	300.81781005859375	16.04962158203125	428.8559799194336	80

e ≤ ∼e. The merger is blocked and it is optimal for Þrms not to bid. Q.E.D.	74.8800048828125	333.7214660644531	17.825927734375	385.4100036621094	80
In this region, both the change in consumer surplus and welfare are non-positive.	92.39999389648438	358.7778015136719	12.0	428.9196472167969	81
Hence, Þrms do not have suﬃcient resources to compensate the antitrust agency for the	74.87998962402344	376.05780029296875	12.0	446.46131896972656	81
loss of consumers surplus that a merger would entail. As a result, Þrms do not bid and	74.8800048828125	393.4577941894531	12.0	446.44793701171875	81

Let us now focus on eﬃciency level above ∼e, such that ∼e < e < e0. In this region, the	92.39997863769531	426.36138916015625	14.158599853515625	428.9269256591797	81
change in consumers surplus is still negative and Þrms might be able to provide enough	74.8800048828125	445.41778564453125	12.0	446.46099853515625	81

agency in stage 3, Þrms will have to ensure that U2(D = 1) ≥ 0. Consider the highest	74.8800048828125	480.0977783203125	16.049652099609375	446.5020751953125	81
amount that Þrms can bid, i.e. their entire proÞt. The resulting value of the utility of the	74.8800048828125	497.497802734375	12.0	446.439697265625	81
agency if the merger is allowed is then given by S2∗(e) = CS∗ + αΠ∗m + (α − ε(N − M ))Πc∗.	74.88003540039062	514.77783203125	16.049560546875	446.4959411621094	81
Let e∗2 be the eﬃciency level such that S2∗(e∗2) = 0. Note that S2∗(e) is continuous and	74.87997436523438	532.1777954101562	14.272491455078125	446.4540100097656	81
monotonically increasing in e by A1 and A2. Since S2∗(∼e) < 0 and S2∗(e0) > 0 it follows	74.87997436523438	547.681396484375	16.168792724609375	446.4480285644531	81
that ∼e < e∗2 < e0 and that it is unique.	74.87997436523438	565.0814208984375	16.048919677734375	194.72525024414062	81
Lemma 5 For ∼e < e < e∗2 Þrms do not bid and the merger is blocked. For e∗2 ≤ e < e0	74.87999725341797	595.3214111328125	17.8260498046875	445.82752227783203	82
Þrms bid such that U2(D = 1) = 0 and the merger is allowed.	74.87999725341797	614.3800659179688	13.190261840820312	313.38953399658203	82
Proof : Let ∼e < e < e∗2. In this case, S2∗(e) < 0, which implies that the merger is	92.39997863769531	642.9613647460938	16.049148559570312	428.92674255371094	83
blocked even if Þrms bid their entire proÞts. Hence, Þrms will not bid and the merger	74.8800048828125	662.017822265625	12.0	446.536865234375	83
is blocked. Let e∗2 ≤ e < e0, which implies that S2∗(e) ≥ 0 . Any pair of bids such	74.88006591796875	679.4177856445312	16.04962158203125	446.45623779296875	83
that Fm(D = 1), Fc(D = 1) such that U2(D = 1) = 0 is an equilibrium. The merger is	74.87997436523438	696.6978149414062	13.194534301757812	446.4553527832031	83

As eﬃciency increases beyond the level at which welfare is unchanged, proÞts increase	92.4000015258789	94.41778564453125	12.0	428.94478607177734	85
and the harm to consumers falls. There is a region (∼e < e < e∗2) for which the proÞts are	74.8800048828125	110.0413818359375	16.0489501953125	446.4444580078125	85
still insuﬃcient to provide adequate incentives to the antitrust agency and the merger is	74.88006591796875	129.09783935546875	12.0	446.462646484375	85
prohibited even though it would increase welfare. In this region, there is a type I error	74.88006591796875	146.37786865234375	12.0	446.56927490234375	85
but no social waste associated with lobbying. Beyond this level of eﬃciency (e∗2 ≤ e < e0),	74.88006591796875	163.77777099609375	16.04962158203125	446.49591064453125	85
the merger is allowed but only because Þrms provide adequate inducement, which involve	74.87997436523438	181.05780029296875	12.0	446.4565734863281	85
some social waste. As the eﬃciency level approaches the level for which consumer surplus	74.87997436523438	198.45782470703125	12.0	446.4827575683594	85
is unaﬀected, the bids and hence the social waste converge to zero.	74.87997436523438	215.73785400390625	12.0	342.357666015625	85
We now consider the region where the Þrms incentives are not aligned, i.e. such that	92.39997863769531	233.13787841796875	12.0	429.00596618652344	85

Lemma 6 For e ≥ e0, the merger is allowed. The merging Þrms bid Fm(D = 1) =	74.8800048828125	280.78009033203125	16.04730224609375	446.4132080078125	86

Proof : See proof of Lemma 3, which applies mutatis mutandis.	92.4000015258789	328.29779052734375	12.0	325.64293670654297	87
In this region, the level of eﬃciency is such that competitors are harmed by the	92.4000015258789	351.6977844238281	12.0	428.88826751708984	88
merger and would want to inßuence the antitrust agency to block the merger. In the	74.87998962402344	368.977783203125	12.0	446.4552764892578	88
case where competitors are badly hurt by a merger (CS∗ < −βΠc∗), they are capable	74.87998962402344	386.3777770996094	16.049652099609375	446.4514923095703	88
to compensate the agency for the loss in consumer surplus that would arise if the merger	74.8800048828125	403.6578063964844	12.0	446.5498046875	88
is prohibited. In this case, the merging Þrms, which can always trump the competitors,	74.8800048828125	421.05780029296875	12.0	446.54754638671875	88
need to compensate for the maximum bid that competitors can lodge. The agency	74.88003540039062	438.3377990722656	12.0	446.5392761230469	88
make no error in its decision but lobbying leads to social waste and some rent for the	74.88003540039062	455.6177978515625	12.0	446.4396057128906	88
antitrust agency. When the maximum bid of competitors cannot compensate for the	74.88003540039062	473.0177917480469	12.0	446.4683532714844	88
change in consumer surplus, the merging Þrms do not need to bid and there is no waste	74.88003540039062	490.29779052734375	12.0	446.4298400878906	88
In sum, we Þnd (as in the case of the welfare standard) that the merger is allowed	92.40005493164062	507.69775390625	12.0	428.8907165527344	88
despite opposing interest. Under the consumer surplus standard, the merger is pushed	74.88006591796875	524.977783203125	12.0	446.3892822265625	88
through, to the left of e0, by a joint action of the mergers Þrms and their competitors	74.88006591796875	542.3778076171875	12.3822021484375	446.43701171875	88
. To the right, the merger might be pushed through again by the action by the merging	74.8800048828125	559.6578369140625	12.3822021484375	446.50335693359375	88
Þrms which compensate for that of the competitors. When lobbying is taking place,	74.8800048828125	577.0578002929688	12.0	446.51409912109375	88
some ineﬃciency will also arise. Comparing the condition in Lemma 6 with Lemma	74.8800048828125	594.3377685546875	12.0	446.54888916015625	88
3, we Þnd that the condition for a wasteful equilibrium to exist is stricter for the	74.8800048828125	611.73779296875	12.0	446.4263916015625	88
welfare standard. This implies that there exist parameter regions for which equilibrium	74.8800048828125	629.017822265625	12.0	446.63507080078125	88
under the welfare standard does not involve any bidding, while the equilibrium under the	74.8800048828125	646.2977905273438	12.0	446.41552734375	88
consumer surplus standard does involve bidding (and therefore waste). The reverse is	74.8800048828125	663.69775390625	12.0	446.408203125	88
not true. In addition, the bid of the merging Þrms under the consumer surplus standard	74.8800048828125	680.977783203125	12.0	446.39031982421875	88
(Fm(D = 1) = −βΠc∗ − CS∗) is always higher than the bid under the welfare standard	74.8800048828125	698.3778076171875	16.04962158203125	446.41680908203125	88

At this stage, the government decides on the welfare standard in order to maximise (1).	74.87999725341797	119.497802734375	12.0	446.49365997314453	92

the welfare standard and consumer surplus standard respectively. In order to provide	74.87998962402344	154.17779541015625	12.0	446.44215393066406	92
a benchmark, we also deÞne the maximum level of the governments objective function	74.87998962402344	171.45782470703125	12.0	446.4312286376953	92
that could be achieved for any e, i.e. the Þrst best denoted by W∧ . Under the Þrst best,	74.87998962402344	186.24139404296875	17.15863037109375	446.50318908691406	92
the social planner would set waste to zero, which implies no bidding by the Þrms. For	74.87997436523438	208.2978515625	12.0	446.5475769042969	92
e < ∼e, the merger will be banned so that W∧ = 0. For e ≥ ∼e, mergers will be allowed so	74.8800048828125	223.0814208984375	20.82598876953125	446.526123046875	92

The next two lemmas characterize the governments objective function under the	92.39999389648438	264.69781494140625	12.0	428.9160461425781	93

Lemma 1. Consider the second statement; from Lemma 2, it follows that in equilibrium	74.87999725341797	439.65777587890625	12.0	446.53662872314453	95
Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ = αFm(D = 1) + (α − ε(N − M ))Fc(D = 1). Using this equality to	74.87999725341797	456.93780517578125	16.04962158203125	446.5224075317383	95

The previous results are further illustrated in Figure 3 which represents the diﬀerence	92.39999389648438	620.8577880859375	12.0	428.9255676269531	98

eﬃciency gains are very small (i.e. e < e∗1), the merger is always banned, no bids are put	74.8800048828125	655.5377807617188	14.272781372070312	446.4742431640625	98

When e∗1 ≤ e < ∼e, mergers are still prevented under the consumer surplus standard,	92.40000915527344	708.6015014648438	17.82592010498047	428.93995666503906	99
no bids are put forward and the Þrst best is achieved (W∧ = W2 = 0). By contrast, under	74.87998962402344	725.6414794921875	17.968833923339844	446.5270538330078	99

there is a type II error, and (ii) there is waste associated with the bids. The sum of	74.87998962402344	129.09783935546875	12.0	446.4707794189453	101
the two ineﬃciencies add up to the value of the bids (so that W1 − W2 = −(Fm + Fc)).	74.87998962402344	146.3778076171875	16.04962158203125	446.49366760253906	101
The reason is that the eﬀective value of the bid (the part which is not wasted) has to	74.88006591796875	163.77783203125	12.0	446.510498046875	101
compensate exactly for the loss of welfare in equilibrium. The ineﬃciency, which is the	74.88006591796875	181.057861328125	12.0	446.4337158203125	101
loss of welfare and the wasted part of the bids, is thus equal to the bids. Furthermore,	74.88009643554688	198.4578857421875	12.0	446.4623107910156	101
the magnitude of the bids falls as the eﬃciency gains of the merger increase (see Figure	74.88009643554688	215.7379150390625	12.0	446.4768981933594	101

When ∼e ≤ e < e∗2, under the welfare standard Þrms do not bid and the merger is	92.39999389648438	266.0413818359375	17.8260498046875	428.9015808105469	101

allowed so that the Þrst best is achieved (W1 = W = Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗). Under the	74.87997436523438	287.8577880859375	14.39447021484375	446.4444274902344	101
consumer surplus standard, the merger is blocked but Þrms do not put forward any	74.8800048828125	305.2578125	12.0	446.4671630859375	101
bid. There is thus a type I error: a merger which increases welfare is blocked and	74.8800048828125	322.537841796875	11.999969482421875	446.4564208984375	101
W1 − W2 = Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗. Given that welfare increases in e, the opportunity cost of	74.8800048828125	339.93780517578125	16.04962158203125	446.45037841796875	101
not allowing the merger increases as the eﬃciency gain rises (see Figure 3).	74.8800048828125	357.2178039550781	12.0	385.15313720703125	101
When e∗2 ≤ e < e0, under the welfare standard, the Þrst best is achieved. Under the	92.4000244140625	374.6177978515625	16.04962158203125	428.9578857421875	101

the proÞt which is not wasted is equal to the loss in consumer surplus. Therefore, the	74.88003540039062	443.977783203125	12.0	446.3904724121094	101
change in welfare at e∗2 is equal to zero. As a result W1 − W2 is continuous at e = e∗2.	74.88003540039062	461.2577819824219	16.049652099609375	446.4959411621094	101
Moreover, as eﬃciency gains increase, the waste in bidding falls (down to 0 at e0).	74.87997436523438	478.5378112792969	12.3822021484375	419.4936218261719	101
Overall, it appears that neither standard dominates over the entire range of param-	92.39999389648438	501.93780517578125	12.0	428.9448547363281	102
eters, even though one of the two standards is always Þrst best for any given eﬃciency	74.87998962402344	519.2177734375	12.0	446.5008087158203	102
level. Consumer surplus and welfare standard give rise to diﬀerent types of costs de-	74.8800048828125	536.6177978515625	12.0	446.4000244140625	102
pending on the eﬃciency level. On the one hand, a number of relatively ineﬃcient	74.88003540039062	553.8978271484375	12.0	446.5128479003906	102
mergers  which decrease welfare  are pushed through under a welfare standard. On	74.88003540039062	571.2977905273438	12.0	446.4000549316406	102
the other hand, some relatively eﬃcient mergers (which would increase welfare) are pro-	74.88003540039062	588.5777587890625	12.0	446.4156188964844	102
hibited under the consumer surplus standard. This result accord with intuition; when	74.88005065917969	605.977783203125	12.0	446.38575744628906	102
the agency is supposed to consider welfare but Þrms can inßuence the agency, one would	74.88005065917969	623.2578125	12.0	446.4600372314453	102
indeed expect the outcome to be biased in favour of Þrms and against consumers. With	74.88009643554688	640.5377807617188	12.0	446.4155578613281	102
a welfare standard, lobbying activity thus lowers welfare.5	74.88009643554688	656.7177124023438	13.22003173828125	295.4998779296875	102

the welfare standard would not give rise to any error. It is a standard feature of common agency games	74.88009643554688	695.1996459960938	10.080001831054688	446.4374084472656	103
that when the agent has a welfare standard and the principals bid their marginal beneÞt, the agent	74.88009643554688	709.5999755859375	10.079994201660156	446.3575134277344	103
mimics the behaviour of an independent agent which would simply maximise welfare (see for instance	74.88009643554688	723.8803100585938	10.080001831054688	446.3535461425781	103

By contrast, when the agency defends consumers interest, it will be biased against	92.4000015258789	94.41778564453125	12.0	428.96419525146484	105
the interest of Þrms and tend to prohibit mergers that enhance welfare. Firms lobbying	74.8800048828125	111.81781005859375	12.0	446.5836181640625	105
activity will tend to compensate for the narrow objective of the agency and thereby	74.88002014160156	129.09783935546875	12.0	446.44322204589844	105
reduce the range of relatively eﬃcient mergers that are prohibited. Without lobbying,	74.88002014160156	146.37786865234375	12.0	446.4839324951172	105
all mergers in between ∼e and e0 would be prohibited with a loss in welfare equal to	74.88002014160156	162.00152587890625	14.158447265625	446.50791931152344	105
Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗. With lobbying, the welfare loss is strictly smaller for the region between	74.87998962402344	181.05780029296875	14.39447021484375	446.4768829345703	105
e∗2 and e0 (see Figure 3). Under the consumer surplus standard, lobbying thus strictly	74.87998962402344	198.45782470703125	14.2725830078125	446.4876251220703	105
improves welfare.	74.87999725341797	215.73785400390625	12.0	88.18560028076172	105
A comparison between the two standards over the entire range of parameters can	92.39999389648438	239.13787841796875	12.0	428.8954772949219	106
also be undertaken. However, such a comparison requires an explicit assumption about	74.87998962402344	256.41790771484375	12.0	446.46473693847656	106
the distribution of mergers that the agency will face in terms of their eﬃciency level.	74.87998962402344	273.69793701171875	12.0	446.5139923095703	106
This distribution is also likely to have a strong inßuence on the eventual outcome of	74.87997436523438	291.09796142578125	12.0	446.4490661621094	106
the comparison. For instance, it is likely that if the expected population of mergers is	74.87994384765625	308.37799072265625	12.0	446.4801025390625	106
biased in favour of very eﬃcient mergers, the consumer surplus standard will dominate.	74.87994384765625	325.77801513671875	11.999969482421875	446.48046875	106
At the opposite, if the distribution of expected mergers features a high density of rather	74.87992858886719	343.0579833984375	12.0	446.5164337158203	106
ineﬃcient mergers, it is likely that a consumer surplus standard will be preferred. In	74.87992858886719	360.4579772949219	12.0	446.47206115722656	106
addition, an explicit comparison of the two standards would require a speciÞc assumption	74.87992858886719	377.73797607421875	12.0	446.4575958251953	106
about the distribution of lobbying eﬀorts between merging Þrms and their competitors	74.87991333007812	395.1379699707031	12.0	446.4383850097656	106
(given that action by the latter is less eﬃcient than action by the former). Again, this	74.87991333007812	412.41796875	12.0	446.4637756347656	106
assumption might matter a great deal for the outcome of the comparison and would	74.87991333007812	429.8179626464844	12.0	446.4383239746094	106
be some somewhat arbitrary. Hence, rather than make explicit assumptions about	74.87991333007812	447.09796142578125	12.0	446.4986267089844	106

particular, we next examine how the comparison between the two standards would be	74.87991333007812	499.0579528808594	12.0	446.4084777832031	106
aﬀected by a change in the eﬃciency of the lobbying process and a change in the size of	74.87991333007812	516.4579467773438	12.0	446.4610290527344	106

Grossman and Helpman, 1994). Hence, if consumers had equally eﬃcient access to the antitrust agency,	74.87999725341797	556.719482421875	10.079986572265625	446.44629669189453	107
all welfare enhancing mergers would be allowed in our model and all welfare decreasing mergers would	74.87899780273438	571.1197509765625	10.079986572265625	446.4735412597656	107
be prohibited. However, the Þrst best would still not be obtained as a potentially large amount of waste	74.87899780273438	585.4000854492188	10.080001831054688	446.4403991699219	107
would occur because of lobbying. In addition, if the merging Þrms, the competitors and consumers	74.87899780273438	599.8003540039062	10.080001831054688	446.3605041503906	107

ciency of the lobbying process. As discussed above, more transparency in the operation	74.8800048828125	167.2578125	12.0	446.43450927734375	111
of the anti-trust agency will tend to increase the amount of resources which is wasted	74.8800048828125	184.537841796875	12.0	446.4095458984375	111
in lobbying. In the context of our model, a more eﬃcient process of lobbying is thus	74.8800048828125	201.9378662109375	12.0	446.46844482421875	111
associated with less transparency. An increase in α or a decrease in ε are associated	74.8800048828125	219.2178955078125	12.3822021484375	446.42633056640625	111

by a change in α and ε. A full comparison between the two standards, however, needs	74.8800048828125	271.2979736328125	12.3822021484375	446.43731689453125	111

Proposition 1 illustrates that a more eﬃcient lobbying process increases the set of	92.39999389648438	441.81781005859375	12.0	428.9316101074219	114

neither ∼e nor e0 are eﬀected by the eﬃciency of the lobbying process. The reason for this	74.87997436523438	561.361328125	14.15869140625	446.4131164550781	114
is that the ineﬃcient outcomes near ∼e cannot be pushed through by Þrms. A marginal	74.87998962402344	578.761474609375	14.158523559570312	446.4948272705078	114
increase in eﬃciency does not change this. Also, in the upper limit of the ineﬃciency	74.8800048828125	597.8178100585938	12.0	446.5008544921875	114
region (near e0) only a marginal amount of resources is necessary to push the merger	74.88003540039062	615.0977783203125	12.3822021484375	446.5666809082031	114
through at this point and more eﬃcient lobbying does not aﬀect the outcome.	74.87999725341797	632.497802734375	12.0	399.6960220336914	114
Hence, it appears that in terms of parameters ranges, the consumer surplus standard	92.39999389648438	649.77783203125	12.0	428.9577941894531	114
becomes more attractive than the welfare standard as the eﬃciency of lobbying increases.	74.87998962402344	667.1777954101562	12.0	446.5080108642578	114
The next proposition examines how the value of the governments objective function	92.4000244140625	684.457763671875	12.0	428.9366455078125	114
is aﬀected by more eﬃcient lobbying.	74.88002014160156	701.8577880859375	12.0	190.6608123779297	114

Proposition 2 In the eﬃciency region where the CSS is dominated, the net cost of the	74.87999725341797	94.42010498046875	12.42938232421875	446.53919219970703	116
CSS is reduced for more eﬃcient lobbying process. When the CSS dominates, the eﬀect	74.8800048828125	111.82012939453125	12.0	446.4239501953125	116
of a more eﬃcient lobbying process on the net beneÞt of the CSS is ambiguous.	74.8800048828125	129.10015869140625	12.0	403.8648376464844	116
Proof: Let us Þrst consider the region e∗2 ≤ e < e0 . The net cost of the CSS using	92.4000244140625	159.3377685546875	16.04962158203125	428.9638671875	117
the above Lemmata 7 and 8 is W1 − W2 = (1 − α)Fm + (1 − α + ε(N − M ))Fc. From	74.8800048828125	176.73779296875	16.04962158203125	446.55963134765625	117
the equilibrium conditions in stage 2 (Lemma 5) for any e, αFm + (α − ε(N − M ))Fc	74.8800048828125	194.017822265625	16.04962158203125	445.8984375	117
does not change with α (or ε ). Hence, when α increases (or ε falls), Fm + Fc falls.	74.87999725341797	211.41778564453125	13.1944580078125	446.49597930908203	117
Since (1 − α) and Fm + Fc fall in α (increase in ε ), it follows that W1 − W2 falls in α	74.8800048828125	228.69781494140625	16.04962158203125	446.303955078125	117
(increases in ε ). Consider now the region ∼e ≤ e < e∗2. In this region (see Lemmata 7	74.87997436523438	244.3214111328125	17.82598876953125	446.5224914550781	117
and 8) we have W1 − W2 = Πm + Πc + CS, which is independent of α (or ε ). Since,	74.8800048828125	263.3778076171875	16.04962158203125	446.48040771484375	117
∂e∗2/∂α < 0 and ∂e∗2/∂ε > 0 by Proposition 1, the Þrst part of the proposition follows.	74.87997436523438	280.77777099609375	14.2724609375	446.4756774902344	117
For the second part of the proposition consider the region e∗1 ≤ e < ∼e. We focus on the	74.8800048828125	296.28143310546875	17.82598876953125	446.445556640625	117
comparative statics of α . The proof for ε is analogous. By Proposition 1 ∂e∗1/∂α < 0,	74.8800048828125	315.3377685546875	14.3924560546875	446.49603271484375	117
so that we Þrst consider e∗1 + ∂e∗1/∂α < e < ∼e. In this region from Lemmata 7 and 8	74.88003540039062	330.9613952636719	16.168853759765625	446.5113220214844	117
we have W1 − W2 = −Fm − Fc, which is increasing in α by the equilibrium condition in	74.88002014160156	350.0177917480469	16.04962158203125	446.44432067871094	117
Lemma 2. Since, ∂e∗1/∂α < 0, there is a new region where the CSS is dominated, i.e.	74.8800048828125	367.41778564453125	14.272735595703125	446.434814453125	117
W1 − W2 < 0. Q.E.D.	74.87998962402344	384.6977844238281	16.04962158203125	112.06082153320312	117
The Proposition is illustrated in Figure 4 and oﬀers two useful insights. The Þrst	92.4000015258789	413.977783203125	12.0	428.9868392944336	118
insight relates to the parameter range for which the consumer surplus standard yields an	74.88003540039062	431.3777770996094	12.0	446.4253234863281	118
ineﬃcient outcome. As discussed, this parameter range is not aﬀected by the eﬃciency	74.88003540039062	448.65777587890625	12.0	446.5008239746094	118
of lobbying. However, Proposition 2 illustrates that the type of ineﬃciency that occurs	74.88006591796875	466.0577697753906	12.0	446.47802734375	118
in this range is aﬀected by the eﬃciency of lobbying: as lobbying becomes more eﬃcient,	74.88006591796875	483.3377685546875	12.0	446.49847412109375	118
the range of parameter for which a type I errors occurs shrinks and the range of parameter	74.88009643554688	500.73779296875	12.0	446.5630187988281	118
for which lobbying occurs, and implies some waste, will increase (see Figure 4). In other	74.88009643554688	518.0177612304688	12.0	446.5452575683594	118
words, as lobbying becomes more eﬃcient, more resources are available at the margin	74.88009643554688	535.417724609375	12.0	446.4288024902344	118
to inßuence the antitrust agency and mergers which require marginally more inßuence	74.88009643554688	552.69775390625	12.0	446.4419860839844	118
can eﬀectively be pushed through. As a result the range of parameters for which a type	74.88006591796875	570.0977783203125	12.0	446.40478515625	118
I error occurs shrinks, and more mergers are pushed through.	74.88007354736328	587.3777465820312	12.0	314.7168502807617	118
In addition, a type I error always entails a higher eﬃciency loss than lobbying in	92.40007019042969	604.65771484375	12.0	428.9472198486328	118
this parameter range (see Figure 4 again). The waste associated with lobbying is only	74.88003540039062	622.0577392578125	12.0	446.5345764160156	118
a fraction of the loss entailed by prohibiting the merger which is the entire opportunity	74.88003540039062	639.3377685546875	12.0	446.5919494628906	118
cost of the merger in terms of welfare. Hence, a reduction of type I errors will reduce	74.88003540039062	656.7377319335938	12.0	446.3941345214844	118
the cost associated with the consumer surplus standard in this area.	74.88003540039062	674.0177001953125	12.0	349.3499450683594	118
Consequently, there are two reasons as to why the cost associated with the consumer	92.40003967285156	691.417724609375	12.0	429.0165252685547	118
surplus standard falls when lobbying becomes more eﬃcient. First, more eﬃcient lob-	74.88003540039062	708.69775390625	12.0	446.4311218261719	118
bying implies that fewer resources are wasted for any eﬃciency level for which lobbying	74.88003540039062	726.0977172851562	12.0	446.5234680175781	118

occurs. Second, more eﬃcient lobbying also reduces the range of parameters for which a	74.87999725341797	94.41778564453125	12.0	446.50074005126953	120
type I error occurs and this reduces the cost of the consumer surplus standard because	74.8800048828125	111.81781005859375	12.0	446.4024658203125	120
for any eﬃciency level, a type I error is more costly than the waste associated with	74.8800048828125	129.09783935546875	12.0	446.45050048828125	120
successful lobbying. This result which will be useful for further reference is collected in	74.8800048828125	146.37786865234375	12.0	446.4239501953125	120

Lemma 9 In the eﬃciency region where the CSS is dominated, the net cost of the CSS	74.8800048828125	194.02020263671875	12.42938232421875	446.48779296875	121
increases in e∗2, holding ∼e and e0 constant.	74.88001251220703	209.64154052734375	16.04901123046875	214.63677215576172	121
Proof: Follows from Proposition 2.	92.40000915527344	241.65777587890625	12.0	177.79319763183594	122
The second insight oﬀered by Proposition 2 relates to the parameter region where	92.40000915527344	264.93780517578125	12.0	428.9016876220703	123
mergers that decrease welfare are pushed through by lobbying under the welfare stan-	74.88002014160156	282.33782958984375	12.0	446.3446502685547	123
dard. As discussed above, more eﬃcient lobbying (less transparency) extends the range	74.88002014160156	299.61785888671875	12.0	446.39524841308594	123
of mergers for which a type II error occurs under the welfare standard. At the same	74.88002014160156	317.01788330078125	12.0	446.3749237060547	123
time, for any value of the eﬃciency parameter for which the merger is pushed through,	74.88002014160156	334.2978820800781	12.0	446.4526824951172	123
less resources are wasted in inßuencing the government (see Figure 4). As a result the	74.88003540039062	351.6978759765625	12.0	446.4709167480469	123
impact of more eﬃcient lobbying is ambiguous. This trade-oﬀ also illustrates the eﬀect	74.88003540039062	368.9778747558594	12.0	446.5127868652344	123
of transparency. On the one hand, transparency is desirable because it will reduce the	74.87997436523438	386.37786865234375	12.0	446.4516906738281	123
scope of undesirable deals that Þrms can manage to push through. On the other hand,	74.87997436523438	403.6578674316406	12.0	446.4745788574219	123
transparency is undesirable because it imposes a constraint on Þrms that they can only	74.87997436523438	421.057861328125	12.0	446.4731750488281	123
circumvent at great cost.	74.87997436523438	438.3378601074219	12.0	127.61520385742188	123
We next characterise the trade-oﬀ with respect to market structure.	92.39997863769531	467.61785888671875	12.0	348.0720977783203	124
Proposition 3 The larger the size of the merger, the larger the eﬃciency region over	74.87997436523438	497.8601379394531	12.429412841796875	446.5200500488281	125
which the CSS dominates, and the larger the eﬃciency region over which the CSS is	74.8800048828125	515.2601318359375	12.0	446.49365234375	125
dominated. Moreover, when the CSS is dominated, the eﬃciency regions for which Type	74.88003540039062	532.5401611328125	12.0	446.4792175292969	125
I errors occur shrinks relative to the eﬃciency region for which waste occurs.	74.88006591796875	549.9401245117188	12.0	394.16162109375	125
Proof: We Þrst consider the region where the CSS dominates. Note that A3 can be	92.40008544921875	580.1778564453125	11.999984741210938	428.8753662109375	126

written as ∂S∗/∂M < 0. The deÞnition of ∼e then implies that ∂ ∼e/∂M > 0 , i.e. ∼e moves	74.88008117675781	600.1213989257812	14.15863037109375	446.4526824951172	126
to the right (see also Figure 5). If ∂S1∗/∂M > 0 (i.e. when merger size has a strong	74.87997436523438	619.1777954101562	14.392532348632812	446.5045471191406	126
eﬀect on industry proÞts), then ∂e∗1/∂M < 0, which implies that the region is getting	74.8800048828125	636.5777587890625	14.272659301757812	446.4769287109375	126
larger. If ∂S1/∂M < 0, then ∂e∗1/∂M > 0, i.e. e∗1 moves to the right. By A3 and A4 and	74.8800048828125	653.8577880859375	14.392471313476562	446.464599609375	126

since ε0(N − M ) > 0, we have ∂S1∗/∂M > ∂S∗/∂M . Since ∂S1∗/∂e > ∂S∗/∂e it follows	74.8800048828125	672.5778198242188	16.04962158203125	446.44805908203125	126
that ∂ ∼e/∂M > ∂e∗1/∂M , i.e. the function that has e∗1 as a Þxed point shifts by less and	74.8800048828125	688.201416015625	16.168899536132812	446.45526123046875	126
is steeper than the function, which has ∼e as a Þxed point, so that ∼e moves faster to the	74.8800048828125	705.6015014648438	14.03851318359375	446.44195556640625	126

We Þrst show that this area increases. By A3 and A4 we have ∂CS∗/∂M < ∂S∗/∂M .	74.87999725341797	97.29779052734375	12.3822021484375	446.49597930908203	128

Since ∂CS∗/∂e < ∂S∗/∂e it follows that ∂ ∼e/∂M < ∂e0/∂M , i.e. the function that	74.87997436523438	114.24139404296875	14.15863037109375	446.5032653808594	128

last statement of the proposition. By A3 and A4 and since ε0(N − M ) > 0, we have	74.87997436523438	167.977783203125	16.04962158203125	446.4504089355469	128
∂S2∗/∂M > ∂CS∗/∂M . Since ∂S2∗/∂e > ∂CS∗/∂e it follows that ∂e0/∂M > ∂e∗2/∂M ,	74.87997436523438	185.3778076171875	14.2724609375	446.4960021972656	128
i.e. e0 moves faster to the right than e∗2 as M increases. Q.E.D.	74.87997436523438	202.65777587890625	14.3924560546875	323.589599609375	128
Proposition 3 indicates that in the presence of larger mergers, both standards perform	92.39999389648438	225.93780517578125	12.0	429.0189514160156	129
relatively worse, to the extent that the range of parameters for which either standard	74.87998962402344	243.33782958984375	12.0	446.48402404785156	129
yields ineﬃcient outcomes increases.	74.87998962402344	260.61785888671875	12.0	185.5859832763672	129
Consider those mergers which reduce welfare but are pushed through under the wel-	92.39999389648438	289.89788818359375	12.0	428.9050598144531	130
fare standard. Larger mergers tend to reduce welfare for any level of the eﬃciency	74.87998962402344	307.29791259765625	12.0	446.5008087158203	130
parameter, so that in principle Þrms have to provide more inducement in order to push	74.8800048828125	324.57794189453125	11.999969482421875	446.455322265625	130
them through (i.e. ∼e moves right - see Figure 5). However, larger mergers also enhance	74.8800048828125	340.2013854980469	14.158599853515625	446.43359375	130
the proÞts that are available to provide inducement to the agency. Under the assump-	74.87999725341797	359.2577819824219	12.0	446.44434356689453	130
tions of our model6, the latter eﬀect always dominates the former so that the range of	74.87999725341797	375.3178405761719	13.3399658203125	446.47290802001953	130
parameters for which ineﬃcient mergers are pushed through increases.	74.8800048828125	393.93780517578125	12.0	360.1824035644531	130
Proposition 3 also illustrates that increasing the size of a merger does not necessarily	92.4000015258789	411.3377990722656	12.0	428.9953842163086	130
lead to more regulatory clearance. When increasing the size of mergers has a strong	74.8800048828125	428.6177978515625	12.0	446.54290771484375	130
eﬀect on the industry proÞts, more precisely when ∂∂SM1∗ > 0, then e∗1 moves left (see the	74.8800048828125	443.1322021484375	18.360107421875	446.44921875	130
proof of proposition 3), regulatory clearance will never be jeopardised by larger mergers.	74.8800048828125	463.29779052734375	12.0	446.46484375	130
However, when the eﬀect of larger mergers on industry proÞts is smaller, more precisely	74.8800048828125	480.5777893066406	12.0	446.50439453125	130
∂∂SM1∗ < 0, then e∗1 moves right but by less than ∼e. In this case, there will be a range of	76.08000183105469	495.09222412109375	18.3599853515625	445.2550811767578	130
eﬃciency parameters for which regulatory clearance will be jeopardised as the merger	74.87997436523438	515.2578125	12.0	446.5777282714844	130
becomes larger.	74.8799819946289	532.6577758789062	12.0	79.06682586669922	130
Consider the range of eﬃciency parameters for which the consumer surplus standard	92.39997863769531	549.937744140625	12.0	428.9387664794922	130
yields an ineﬃcient outcome. As mergers become larger, both welfare and consumer	74.87997436523438	567.3377685546875	12.0	446.5403747558594	130
surplus are reduced (so that both ∼e and e0 shift right). Under the assumptions of our	74.87997436523438	582.8413696289062	14.15863037109375	446.5296325683594	130
model, the eﬀect on consumer surplus is greater than the eﬀect on welfare so the range	74.8800048828125	602.017822265625	12.0	446.44317626953125	130
of parameter for which the consumer surplus standard yields an ineﬃcient outcome	74.87997436523438	619.2977905273438	12.0	446.4347229003906	130
increases (e0 moves further to the right than ∼e). However, Proposition 3 also shows (see	74.87994384765625	634.9215087890625	14.15850830078125	446.41705322265625	130
the proof) that e0 moves further to the right than e∗2, which implies that the relative	74.8800048828125	653.977783203125	14.392532348632812	446.45269775390625	130
size of the regions for which a type I error occurs under the consumer surplus standard	74.8800048828125	671.2578125	12.0	446.3280029296875	130
6It follows from the fact that welfare is less aﬀected by eﬃciency than industry proÞts and by the	88.31999969482422	692.9851684570312	11.334274291992188	432.98511505126953	131
fact that welfare is an average of proÞt (which increase with merger size) and consumer surplus (which	74.87908935546875	708.6397094726562	10.079994201660156	446.48565673828125	131
decreases with merger size).	74.87908935546875	722.9200439453125	10.080001831054688	121.39646911621094	131

tends to shrink relative to the region for which there is wasteful lobbying. The reason	74.87999725341797	94.41778564453125	12.0	446.39026641845703	133
is as follows: when the size of the mergers increases, consumers surplus fall and more	74.87999725341797	111.81781005859375	12.0	446.3795852661133	133
inducement has to provided to the agency. However, industry proÞts also increase so	74.87999725341797	129.09783935546875	12.0	446.54651641845703	133
that more inducement is available. As before, under the assumptions of our model7,	74.88003540039062	145.15771484375	13.22015380859375	446.4959411621094	133
the latter eﬀect dominates the former and the range of parameter for which successful	74.87997436523438	163.77783203125	12.0	446.5019226074219	133
lobbying arises increases. As a consequence, the range of parameter for which a type	74.87995910644531	181.057861328125	12.0	446.43614196777344	133
I error occurs will shrink relative to the range for which successful  but wasteful 	74.87995910644531	198.4578857421875	12.0	446.5021209716797	133
lobbying arises.	74.87995910644531	215.7379150390625	12.0	78.84718322753906	133
Having considered how the ranges of eﬃciency parameters for either standard is inef-	92.39996337890625	237.81793212890625	12.0	428.931640625	134
Þcient change with merger size, the next propositions analyses how merger size changes	74.87994384765625	255.09796142578125	12.0	446.4193115234375	134
the relative costs and beneÞts of the two standards.	74.87994384765625	272.49798583984375	12.0	264.919189453125	134
Proposition 4 When the CSS dominates, larger mergers increase the net beneÞt of the	74.87994384765625	297.4603271484375	12.42938232421875	446.51519775390625	135
CSS standard, whenever ∂∂SM1∗ > 0, i.e. when increasing merger size has a strong eﬀect	74.87994384765625	311.97216796875	18.36016845703125	446.424072265625	135
on industry proÞts.	74.88006591796875	332.14007568359375	12.0	97.76161193847656	135
Proof: Consider the region where the CSS dominates. By A3 and Lemma 2, we know	92.40007019042969	357.2177734375	12.0	429.02882385253906	136
that Fm+Fc increases in M . Using Lemmata 7 and 8, it follows that ∂(W1−W2)/∂M < 0	74.88006591796875	374.4977722167969	16.049652099609375	446.38787841796875	136
in this region. When ∂∂SM1∗ > 0 , e∗1 moves left and the net beneÞt of the CSS increases.	74.87997436523438	389.0123291015625	18.3599853515625	446.4852600097656	136

The intuition behind this proposition is straightforward. As discussed above, when	92.40000915527344	431.2577819824219	12.0	428.78883361816406	137
increasing the size of mergers has a strong eﬀect on industry proÞts, it will never jeop-	74.8800048828125	448.53778076171875	12.0	446.43963623046875	137
ardise regulatory clearance. In other words, the range of eﬃciency parameters for which	74.8800048828125	465.9377746582031	12.0	446.47808837890625	137
the mergers are pushed through with a given merger size includes the set of eﬃciency	74.8800048828125	483.2177734375	12.0	446.50079345703125	137
parameters for which the mergers are pushed through with any lower merger size. In	74.8800048828125	500.6177978515625	12.0	446.4573974609375	137
addition, for any value of the eﬃciency parameter, a larger merger size implies that the	74.8800048828125	517.8977661132812	12.0	446.4588623046875	137
type II error is more costly and that a stronger inducement (hence more waste) has to	74.8800048828125	535.2977294921875	12.0	446.5152587890625	137
be provided to the agency to push the merger through. In those circumstances, the cost	74.8800048828125	552.5777587890625	12.0	446.48162841796875	137
of the welfare standard it thus unambiguously greater.	74.8800048828125	569.8577880859375	12.0	279.2111511230469	137
When increasing the size of mergers has a weaker eﬀect on industry proÞts, the	92.40000915527344	587.2577514648438	12.0	428.92323303222656	137
matter is less clear. In those circumstances e∗1 moves right, and some larger mergers	74.8800048828125	604.5377197265625	14.392593383789062	446.45172119140625	137
(with low eﬃciency) are blocked, which is Þrst best.	74.87998962402344	621.9378051757812	12.0	266.1539764404297	137
Proposition 5 When the CSS is dominated the eﬀect of larger mergers on the net cost	74.8800048828125	647.0200805664062	12.429443359375	446.4132080078125	138
of the CSS is ambiguous. However, the CSS is more attractive with larger mergers	74.88003540039062	664.3001098632812	12.0	446.4468688964844	138
whenever the lobbying is eﬃcient, and when marginal co-ordination costs are high.	74.88003540039062	681.580078125	12.0	421.6619567871094	138
7It follows from the fact that consumer surplus is less aﬀected by eﬃciency than industry proÞts and	88.31999969482422	701.9851684570312	11.334274291992188	433.02747344970703	139
by the fact that welfare is an average of proÞt (which increase with merger size) and consumer surplus	74.8780517578125	717.6397094726562	10.080001831054688	446.43414306640625	139
(which decreases with merger size).	74.87806701660156	731.9200439453125	10.080001831054688	153.77345275878906	139

Proof : Note that ∂ ∼e/∂M and ∂e0/∂M are unaﬀected by α, β, and ε0. Further note	92.4000015258789	92.64154052734375	14.158447265625	428.9267807006836	141
that ∂S2∗/∂M is increasing in α, β, and ε0 which implies that ∂2e∗2/∂M ∂α, ∂2e∗2/∂M ∂β,	74.8800048828125	110.73028564453125	15.36004638671875	446.4959716796875	141
and ∂2e∗2/∂M ∂ε0 are negative. The result follows then from Lemma 9. Q.E.D.	74.87997436523438	128.1302490234375	15.360107421875	400.2023620605469	141
Proposition 5 conÞrms that the eﬀect of merger size on the cost of the consumer	92.4000015258789	152.3778076171875	12.0	429.03133392333984	142
surplus standard is ambiguous. This should not come as a surprise given that increasing	74.87998962402344	169.77783203125	12.0	446.40846252441406	142
the merger size both increases and shifts rightward the range of parameters for which	74.87998962402344	187.057861328125	12.0	446.4612579345703	142
the consumer surplus standard yields an ineﬃcient outcome.	74.87998962402344	204.4578857421875	12.0	309.80516052246094	142
The second part of the proposition uncovers a complementarity between merger size	92.39999389648438	221.7379150390625	12.0	428.9053649902344	142
and the eﬃciency of the lobbying process: the eﬀect of merger size on the range over	74.87998962402344	239.137939453125	12.0	446.5690460205078	142
which the consumer surplus standard yields ineﬃcient outcomes is unaﬀected by the	74.87997436523438	256.41796875	12.0	446.4457092285156	142
eﬃciency of lobbying. But the eﬀect of merger size on the region over which a type	74.87997436523438	273.697998046875	12.0	446.4610900878906	142
I error occurs within that range is negatively inßuenced by the eﬃciency of lobbying.	74.87997436523438	291.0980224609375	12.0	446.4912414550781	142
The more eﬃcient the lobbying, the more the region over which type I errors occurs will	74.87997436523438	308.3780517578125	12.0	446.5008850097656	142
shrink when merger size increases. Hence, not only does lobbying reduce the cost of the	74.8799819946289	325.778076171875	11.999969482421875	446.46248626708984	142
consumer surplus standard on it own right (see above), but it also make the consumer	74.8799819946289	343.05804443359375	12.0	446.51741790771484	142
surplus standard more attractive when merger size increases.	74.8799819946289	360.4580383300781	12.0	311.81282806396484	142
Collecting the above results, we Þnd that eﬃcient lobbying and large mergers rein-	92.39997863769531	377.738037109375	12.0	428.9181365966797	142
force each other in reducing the cost the consumer surplus standard in regions where it	74.87997436523438	395.1380310058594	12.0	446.4241027832031	142
yields an ineﬃcient outcome. Where the welfare standard yields ineﬃcient outcomes,	74.87997436523438	412.41802978515625	12.0	446.4863586425781	142
large mergers make matters worse independently of the eﬃciency of lobbying (at least	74.87997436523438	429.8180236816406	12.0	446.5008239746094	142

This paper evaluates alternative rules that can be assigned to a merger control agency	74.87999725341797	520.537841796875	12.0	446.4588088989258	145
which can be inßuenced by interested parties. We Þnd that neither a welfare standard nor	74.87999725341797	537.9378051757812	12.0	446.48755645751953	145
a consumer surplus standard dominates. The consumer surplus and welfare standard also	74.87997436523438	555.2177734375	12.0	446.4636535644531	145
give rise to diﬀerent types of ineﬃciencies: relatively ineﬃcient mergers  which decrease	74.87997436523438	572.6177978515625	12.0	446.4455261230469	145
welfare  are pushed through under a welfare standard, while relatively eﬃcient mergers	74.8800048828125	589.8978271484375	12.0	446.44561767578125	145
(which would increase welfare) are prohibited under the consumer surplus standard.	74.8800048828125	607.2977905273438	12.0	446.4407958984375	145
While lobbying activity is undesirable under a welfare standard, it raises welfare under	74.8800048828125	624.5777587890625	12.0	446.54180908203125	145
a consumer surplus standard.	74.8800048828125	641.977783203125	12.0	150.42958068847656	145
The process of lobbying - as characterized by transparency and co-ordination costs -	92.40000915527344	659.2578125	12.0	428.8258819580078	145
is shown to be important in terms of the relative performance of the two standards. Both	74.8800048828125	676.6577758789062	12.0	446.47064208984375	145
transparency as well as co-ordination costs make lobbying less eﬀective. Under a welfare	74.8800048828125	693.937744140625	12.0	446.470947265625	145
standard this has two eﬀects. On the one hand, it will reduce the scope of undesirable	74.8800048828125	711.2177734375	12.0	446.444580078125	145
deals that Þrms can manage to push through. On the other hand, transparency and	74.8800048828125	728.6177978515625	12.0	446.38787841796875	145
20	292.
co-ordination costs impose a constraint that Þrms can only circumvent at a cost. By	74.87999725341797	94.41778564453125	12.0	446.5536575317383	147
contrast, transparency or co-ordination costs do not aﬀect the scope of deals for which	74.8800048828125	111.81781005859375	12.0	446.456298828125	147
a consumer surplus standard is ineﬃcient. It only aﬀects the balance between wrong	74.8800048828125	129.09783935546875	12.0	446.53070068359375	147
decisions and waste in lobbying. For instance, more transparency actually shift the	74.8800048828125	146.37786865234375	12.0	446.40728759765625	147
balance towards wrong decisions because it reduces Þrmss eﬀectiveness in lobbying.	74.8800048828125	163.77789306640625	12.0	446.5284423828125	147
Since wrong decisions are socially more costly than lobbying, transparency is actually	74.8800048828125	181.05792236328125	12.0	446.52239990234375	147
not desirable under a consumer surplus standard.	74.8800048828125	198.45794677734375	12.0	253.25872802734375	147
We also Þnd that the size of the proposed merger has a diﬀerent impact on the	92.40000915527344	215.73797607421875	12.0	428.89442443847656	147
performance of the two standards. Under the welfare standard, there are two eﬀects.	74.87997436523438	233.13800048828125	12.0	446.4983825683594	147
On the one hand, larger mergers, which have more resources to lobby the agency, manage	74.87997436523438	250.41802978515625	12.0	446.4408874511719	147
to push more numerous deals through, despite the fact that larger deals are also less	74.87997436523438	267.81805419921875	12.0	446.4252014160156	147
desirable in terms of welfare (and hence require more lobbying to be pushed through).	74.87997436523438	285.09808349609375	12.0	446.4660949707031	147
On the other hand, the deals that are pushed through may on average be less damaging	74.87997436523438	302.49810791015625	12.0	446.4550476074219	147
so that the overall eﬀect is ambiguous. Still, when industry proÞts are strongly aﬀected	74.87997436523438	319.77813720703125	12.0	446.4648132324219	147
by the size of the merger, the former eﬀect will dominate and the welfare standard will	74.8800048828125	337.0581359863281	12.0	446.4853515625	147
perform relatively worse.	74.8800048828125	354.4581298828125	12.0	126.89279174804688	147
The matter is diﬀerent for a consumer surplus standard. The range of deals for which	92.40000915527344	371.7381286621094	12.0	428.9243927001953	147
ineﬃcient outcomes arise increases with larger mergers. But larger mergers also tend to	74.8800048828125	389.13812255859375	12.0	446.4803466796875	147
shift the balance away from wrong decisions and in favour of wasteful lobbying (because	74.8800048828125	406.4181213378906	12.0	446.41107177734375	147
Þrms have more resources). As result, the performance of the consumer surplus standard	74.8800048828125	423.818115234375	12.0	446.43255615234375	147
is not unambiguously worse with larger mergers. In addition, we observe that larger	74.8800048828125	441.0981140136719	12.0	446.57037353515625	147
mergers will shift the balance away from decisions errors more Þrmly when transparency	74.8800048828125	458.49810791015625	12.0	446.48876953125	147
is low. Hence, low transparency and larger mergers are circumstances that reinforce	74.8800048828125	475.7781066894531	12.0	446.50335693359375	147
each other in making a consumer surplus standard more attractive.	74.8800048828125	493.1781005859375	12.0	344.8847961425781	147
These Þndings suggest that a reform of the standard that is assigned to a competition	92.40000915527344	510.4581298828125	12.0	428.88612365722656	147
agency needs to consider the institutional environment in which the agency operates and	74.8800048828125	527.8580932617188	12.0	446.47772216796875	147
the population of cases that the agency is likely to consider. For instance, it may not	74.8800048828125	545.1380615234375	12.0	446.481689453125	147
be appropriate for the EU to move towards a welfare standard unless the transparency	74.8800048828125	562.4180908203125	12.0	446.47576904296875	147
of its procedure is greatly improved. The average size of proposed mergers has been	74.8800048828125	579.818115234375	12.0	446.52001953125	147
unusually large in the recent merger wave (see European Economy, 1999). If one expects	74.8800048828125	597.0980834960938	12.0	446.4971923828125	147
this feature to persist, our analysis would imply that maintaining a consumer surplus	74.8800048828125	614.498046875	12.0	446.4527587890625	147
standard may be appropriate.	74.8800048828125	631.778076171875	12.0	152.64598083496094	147
