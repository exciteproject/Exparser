The most important possible bias is that the physicians	62.36220169067383	58.33349609375	9.96258544921875	226.66901779174805	48
who agreed to participate in the study may be those who are	51.023765563964844	70.7489013671875	9.96258544921875	238.06134796142578	48
most in favor of varicella vaccination and therefore the	51.023765563964844	83.2210693359375	9.96258544921875	238.05731964111328	48
most inclined to convince the parents. This bias is	51.023765563964844	95.6932373046875	9.96258544921875	238.09320831298828	48
unavoidable, but its influence would be the same in both	51.023765563964844	108.108642578125	9.96258544921875	238.05432891845703	48
countries. This potential bias may also have had some	51.023765563964844	120.580810546875	9.96258544921875	238.03043365478516	48

been minimal because the parents completed a strictly	51.023773193359375	145.4683837890625	9.96258544921875	238.08322143554688	48
anonymous self-administered questionnaire that they sent	51.023773193359375	157.9405517578125	9.96258544921875	238.036376953125	48

One other bias could be linked to the fact that the rate of	62.36220932006836	182.828125	9.96258544921875	226.74582290649414	48

absence of reimbursement) explains why many practitioners	51.023773193359375	232.6600341796875	9.96258544921875	238.08724975585938	48

Another limit of our study is also due to the fact that we	62.36220932006836	369.6268005371094	9.96258544921875	226.70993423461914	48

that the presence of a recommendation for the vaccination	51.02278137207031	531.5379638671875	9.962600708007812	238.0752410888672	48

from the media, whereas the French parents’ motivations were	306.14007568359375	83.20806884765625	9.96917724609375	238.11907958984375	50
linked to the social and professional consequences of the	306.14007568359375	95.68023681640625	9.96258544921875	238.09912109375	50
disease, the prevention of infection of others, or the fear of	306.14007568359375	108.09564208984375	9.96258544921875	238.0611572265625	50
scars. These findings suggest that even the French parents who	306.14007568359375	120.56781005859375	9.96258544921875	238.102294921875	50

the US (Taylor and Newman 2000). In particular, when a	306.14007568359375	170.39971923828125	9.96258544921875	238.09814453125	50
recommendation exists, parents are more convinced about the	306.14007568359375	182.81512451171875	9.96258544921875	238.0982666015625	50

percentage in the global population; it reflects the initial	306.14007568359375	245.11920166015625	9.96258544921875	238.0433349609375	50

their children vaccinated. Thus, the percentages reported	306.14007568359375	270.0067443847656	9.96258544921875	238.087158203125	50
here cannot be used as the basis for making conclusions	306.14007568359375	282.4789123535156	9.96258544921875	238.00250244140625	50

tion. The parents’ reluctance is mostly due to the fact that	306.14007568359375	307.3664855957031	9.96917724609375	238.082275390625	50

of parents who were reluctant due to fear of complications	306.14007568359375	344.7262268066406	9.96258544921875	238.0125732421875	50
of the vaccine (55.5% in France and 60.0% in Germany)	306.14007568359375	357.1416320800781	9.96258544921875	237.99261474609375	50
are similar to that reported in the US (69%) (Salmon et al.	306.14007568359375	369.6138000488281	9.96258544921875	238.06231689453125	50
2005). The high proportion of French parents who said they	306.14007568359375	382.0859680175781	9.96258544921875	238.05035400390625	50
were reluctant because the varicella vaccine is too recent	306.14007568359375	394.5013732910156	9.96258544921875	238.0115966796875	50
(45.5%) is surprising, but is probably due to the fact that	306.14007568359375	406.9735412597656	9.96258544921875	238.08123779296875	50
since varicella vaccine is not officially recommended in	306.14007568359375	419.4457092285156	9.96258544921875	238.0682373046875	50
France, little information on varicella vaccination is	306.14007568359375	431.8611145019531	9.96258544921875	238.0811767578125	50
targeted to the general population. This is illustrated by	306.14007568359375	444.3332824707031	9.96258544921875	238.09326171875	50
the fact that nearly half the French parents in our study	306.14007568359375	456.8054504394531	9.96258544921875	238.03448486328125	50
were unaware that a varicella vaccine has been available for	306.14007568359375	469.2208557128906	9.96258544921875	238.0533447265625	50
more than 10 years in the US, compared with 5.9% in	306.14007568359375	481.6930236816406	9.96258544921875	238.06829833984375	50

Differences in reluctance to have children vaccinated due	317.478515625	506.58062744140625	9.96258544921875	226.7398681640625	50
to cost were not as big as expected. However, this finding	306.14007568359375	519.0527954101562	9.96258544921875	238.04644775390625	50
may be biased by the socioeconomic profile of the French	306.14007568359375	531.5249633789062	9.962600708007812	238.04638671875	50
participants; on average, they have a higher educational	306.14007568359375	543.9403686523438	9.962600708007812	238.07427978515625	50
level and therefore a higher income than their German	306.14007568359375	556.4125366210938	9.962600708007812	238.02447509765625	50
counterparts. We cannot, therefore, conclude that French	306.14007568359375	568.8847045898438	9.962600708007812	238.04638671875	50
parents are probably more willing to pay than German	306.14007568359375	581.3001098632812	9.962600708007812	238.0245361328125	50

the varicella vaccine has been recommended for more than	306.14007568359375	693.37939453125	9.962600708007812	238.0484619140625	50
