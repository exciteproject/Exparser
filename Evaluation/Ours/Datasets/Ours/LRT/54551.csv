Presently, Zimbabwe is very much out of the news. The 2013 elections	82.98068237304688	415.867431640625	10.5	297.57794189453125	8
have come and gone; the Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic	82.98068237304688	427.6904296875	10.5	297.6272888183594	8
Front (ZANU-PF) has reasserted its hold on state power; the economy	82.98068237304688	439.513427734375	10.5	297.6545715332031	8
is getting worse and worse; and the world continues to await the dis-	82.98068237304688	451.33642578125	10.5	297.6419677734375	8

Mugabe. In a word, it’s pretty much business as usual, except in so far as	82.98068237304688	474.91943359375	10.5	297.51080322265625	8

considerable interest in the intra–ZANU-PF power struggles around the	82.98068237304688	510.388427734375	10.5	297.5495910644531	8

external interventions to change Zimbabwe’s course have been miserably	40.4901008605957	54.52752685546875	10.5	297.61725997924805	11
ineffective. Accordingly, a democratic solution to the country’s travails is	40.4901008605957	66.35052490234375	10.5	297.5953483581543	11

too-violent political transition to a post-Mugabe order. If Zimbabweans	40.4901008605957	89.99652099609375	10.5	297.6665458679199	11
want a democracy, they must be left to create it for themselves.	40.4901008605957	101.81951904296875	10.5	256.39106369018555	11
The two books reviewed here throw much light on why this policy	60.345603942871094	113.64251708984375	10.5	277.8300247192383	11
position – which I take to be that of the Western and even some African	40.49010467529297	125.46551513671875	10.5	297.7591323852539	11
elites – has come about. They are very different books. David Coltart’s	40.49010467529297	137.22552490234375	10.5	297.7085647583008	11

Zimbabwean history. In contrast, Michael Bratton’s book explains the	40.49010467529297	160.87152099609375	10.5	297.5794143676758	11
Zimbabwean impasse by drawing upon the literature on power sharing	40.49010467529297	172.69451904296875	10.5	297.6035842895508	11
and institutional change. They will almost certainly be able to engage	40.49010467529297	184.51751708984375	10.5	297.6445083618164	11
rather different audiences. Coltart’s account will have more popular	40.49010467529297	196.34051513671875	10.5	297.65811920166016	11
appeal, while Bratton’s will draw more academic attention. Furthermore,	40.49010467529297	208.16351318359375	10.5	297.58683013916016	11
whilst Coltart – sustained by his Christian faith – remains (perversely?)	40.49010467529297	219.98651123046875	10.5	297.7359085083008	11
optimistic about the future of Zimbabwe, Bratton’s realist approach is	40.49010467529297	231.74652099609375	10.5	297.58472442626953	11

racy? There is no originality in these questions. They are of concern to all	40.49010467529297	302.68450927734375	10.5	297.6088333129883	11
those who have an abiding interest in Zimbabwe. However, both books	40.49010467529297	314.50750732421875	10.5	297.5217056274414	11

content, I will discuss how they address these issues.	40.49010467529297	338.09051513671875	10.5	212.81604766845703	11

Bratton “analyzes the resilience of authoritarian rule in Zimbabwe through	40.4901008605957	389.98822021484375	10.5	297.6602592468262	13

“Power politics” he borrows from the realist tradition of international	40.49009704589844	437.21722412109375	10.5	297.5469207763672	13

national arena. While Thomas Hobbes might well protest that Mugabe’s	40.49009704589844	484.50921630859375	10.5	297.80311584472656	13
particular conceit is that he embodies the sovereign, Bratton eschews any	40.49009704589844	496.26922607421875	10.5	297.69606018066406	13
such emphasis upon a “big man,” providing an alternative emphasis on the	40.49009704589844	508.09222412109375	10.5	297.52488708496094	13

Beyond his explanation of power politics, Bratton organises the	102.82571411132812	78.17352294921875	10.5	277.7354431152344	16

“power sharing,” and “power division,” he provides overviews of the	82.97021484375	101.81951904296875	10.5	297.64666748046875	16

deep structural domination long enjoyed by the Kikuyu elite (118). Bratton	82.97021484375	432.61151123046875	10.5	297.8083801269531	16

In Part 3, Bratton turns to fundamental reforms that he considers	102.82571411132812	491.72650146484375	10.5	277.8175354003906	16

these have already received considerable attention, there being wide	40.4901008605957	54.52752685546875	10.5	297.6687431335449	19

needs a fully inclusive constitutional settlement, it needs elections to be	40.4901008605957	78.17352294921875	10.5	297.7294731140137	19

the military. How to achieve these worthy ends is a more difficult matter,	40.4901008605957	101.81951904296875	10.5	297.68757247924805	19

PF undoubtedly engaged in its customary chicanery, it nonetheless won a	40.49010467529297	219.98651123046875	10.5	297.69596099853516	19
renewed mandate, despite popular awareness of its past oppressions. In	40.49010467529297	231.74652099609375	10.5	297.58679962158203	19
the 2013 election, Bratton suggests, many people voted for ZANU-PF	40.49010467529297	243.56951904296875	10.5	297.70227813720703	19
simply because they feared that its rejection would result in a renewal of	40.49010467529297	255.39251708984375	10.5	297.6875991821289	19
political violence and conflict (244). In turn, he holds out little hope that	40.49010467529297	267.21551513671875	10.5	297.66031646728516	19
leadership succession within the ruling party will lead to a more liberal	40.49010467529297	279.03851318359375	10.5	297.6057815551758	19
social compact. Until that time, “the people of Zimbabwe will likely opt	40.49010467529297	290.86151123046875	10.5	297.71595001220703	19
for social peace and stability, rather than transitional justice or even	40.49010467529297	302.68450927734375	10.5	297.67078399658203	19

so on, along with “some of the most literate, hardworking, and kindest	40.4901123046875	437.22314453125	10.5	297.4818420410156	21

has been tumultuous, he is nonetheless “more than ever enthralled by this	40.4901123046875	460.869140625	10.5	297.6256103515625	21
great nation.” What Zimbabwe needs, he argues, is democracy – “a new	40.4901123046875	472.692138671875	10.5	297.7022705078125	21

– and, too often, murders – of numerous victims of the regime. Such	82.97019958496094	172.69451904296875	10.5	297.70005798339844	24
evils are of course valuably aggregated by civil society organisations such	82.97019958496094	184.51751708984375	10.5	297.63502502441406	24
as Amnesty International, but Coltart refers to the individuals involved,	82.97019958496094	196.34051513671875	10.5	297.7064971923828	24
for many of whom he served as a lawyer. For the families of such victims	82.97019958496094	208.16351318359375	10.5	297.66651916503906	24
as much as the victims themselves, it is important to have their names	82.97019958496094	219.98651123046875	10.5	297.56996154785156	24
inscribed into history. Further, in telling these individual stories, Coltart	82.97019958496094	231.74652099609375	10.5	297.6078338623047	24

so on – worked to expose and counter regime oppression. Lawyers will	82.97019958496094	267.21551513671875	10.5	297.6067352294922	24
be gratified that even in situations where the law, judges, and the courts	82.97019958496094	279.03851318359375	10.5	297.7012176513672	24
had been largely suborned by the state, legal processes could sometimes	82.97019958496094	290.86151123046875	10.5	297.74851989746094	24
result in unexpectedly favourable outcomes. They will be less impressed,	82.97019958496094	302.68450927734375	10.5	297.71388244628906	24
however, by the need for even distinguished lawyers like Coltart and	82.97019958496094	314.50750732421875	10.5	297.6644744873047	24

tection of their families. This account joins others (e.g. Todd 2007) in	82.97019958496094	373.55950927734375	10.5	297.66346740722656	24

pose vicious repression in Zimbabwe. In Coltart’s case, he could easily	82.97019958496094	397.20550537109375	10.5	297.6540069580078	24
have emigrated – but rather than take the easy route out, he deliberately	82.97019958496094	409.02850341796875	10.5	297.6623992919922	24
gave up his British citizenship, thereby making it more difficult for the	82.97019958496094	420.78851318359375	10.5	297.5889129638672	24

Any attempt to summarise Coltart’s account would be foolhardy, so	102.82569885253906	444.43450927734375	10.5	277.7428436279297	24
I will simply focus upon three aspects of it which I feel are of particular	82.97019958496094	456.25750732421875	10.5	297.66868591308594	24
value. The first is that it contributes to the growing literature (such as	82.97019958496094	468.08050537109375	10.5	297.6204071044922	24

account of how, as a politically callow youth, he opted to do his national	82.97019958496094	491.72650146484375	10.5	297.6016082763672	24
service rather than flee. Ian Smith’s government had decreed that, upon	82.97019958496094	503.54949951171875	10.5	297.70640563964844	24

threat. For Coltart, therefore, “national service was a necessary evil to	40.4901008605957	89.99652099609375	10.5	297.64142990112305	27

Coltart signed up for the police for three years, and he describes his	60.345603942871094	125.46551513671875	10.5	277.68192291259766	27

Fast-forward to the early 2000s, and there is valuable material on	60.345603942871094	349.91351318359375	10.5	277.81946563720703	27
the early development of the MDC, which Coltart joined only after he	40.49010467529297	361.73651123046875	10.5	297.6161880493164	27
had been invited to become its secretary for legal affairs. Soon he was	40.49010467529297	373.55950927734375	10.5	297.58472442626953	27
heavily involved in both the MDC’s call for a “no” vote in the 2000	40.49010467529297	385.38250732421875	10.5	297.54691314697266	27

subsequent campaign in the 2000 elections, the latter conducted amidst a	40.49010467529297	409.02850341796875	10.5	297.7148208618164	27
reign of terror by ZANU-PF. Standing as the MDC candidate in his	40.49010467529297	420.78851318359375	10.5	297.5636978149414	27
home town of Bulawayo, Coltart was elected to parliament by a sweep-	40.49010467529297	432.61151123046875	10.5	297.7505569458008	27
ing majority. Overall, however, with many of its supporters (notably in	40.49010467529297	444.43450927734375	10.5	297.6225051879883	27

So it was that Coltart became caught up in the maelstrom of opposition	40.49010467529297	468.08050537109375	10.5	297.62146759033203	27

paigning should relate to mass action. This was to involve him in all sorts	40.49010467529297	491.72650146484375	10.5	297.66553497314453	27
of legal tangles with ZANU-PF. It also brought him and the MDC up	40.49010467529297	503.54949951171875	10.5	297.6749954223633	27
against unwelcome regional realities, such as South Africa’s and the	40.49010467529297	515.3095092773438	10.5	297.6907424926758	27

ZANU-PF had trashed virtually all of the SADC’s own electoral guide-	82.97019958496094	54.52752685546875	10.5	297.6287384033203	30

Of particular interest is Coltart’s account of how the MDC began to	102.82569885253906	101.81951904296875	10.5	277.79225158691406	30
unravel into rival factions in the wake of that election. Increasingly, there	82.97019958496094	113.64251708984375	10.5	297.63194274902344	30
were youth members of the MDC who wanted to return fire with fire,	82.97019958496094	125.46551513671875	10.5	297.6025848388672	30
and were impatient that the party’s involvement in parliamentary pro-	82.97019958496094	137.22552490234375	10.5	297.6224822998047	30
cesses had changed nothing. While Coltart insisted that it was the MDC’s	82.97019958496094	149.04852294921875	10.5	297.71067810058594	30
commitment to non-violence which had consistently distinguished it	82.97019958496094	160.87152099609375	10.5	297.6340789794922	30
from ZANU-PF, party leader Morgan Tsvangirai was more equivocal.	82.97019958496094	172.69451904296875	10.5	297.6455535888672	30
Subsequently, latent tensions became overt when the party split around	82.97019958496094	184.51751708984375	10.5	297.6864471435547	30
whether to participate in the 2005 Senate elections (the Senate having	82.97019958496094	196.34051513671875	10.5	297.6455535888672	30
been arbitrarily reinvented after prior abolition in 1989). Despite vigor-	82.97019958496094	208.16351318359375	10.5	297.6414031982422	30
ous efforts by Coltart to broker a peace, the breach was confirmed in	82.97019958496094	219.98651123046875	10.5	297.5385284423828	30
January 2006, when the MDC broke into two factions, one (the majority)	82.97019958496094	231.74652099609375	10.5	297.7096710205078	30
led by Tsvangirai (MDC-T), the other by Gibson Sibanda, who was soon	82.97019958496094	243.56951904296875	10.5	297.58360290527344	30
replaced by Arthur Mutambara (MDC-M). Initially undecided on which	82.97019958496094	255.39251708984375	10.5	297.6833953857422	30
faction to join, Coltart’s mind was made up by revelations made to him	82.97019958496094	267.21551513671875	10.5	297.7589874267578	30
that MDC operatives were being trained in South Africa. Although it was	82.97019958496094	279.03851318359375	10.5	297.71275329589844	30
not clear whether the training was defensive or offensive, weapons were	82.97019958496094	290.86151123046875	10.5	297.44407653808594	30

lence, he regarded this as likely to invite an even harder crackdown by	82.97019958496094	314.50750732421875	10.5	297.5825958251953	30
ZANU-PF on its opponents (440–441).	82.97019958496094	326.26751708984375	10.5	161.77981567382812	30
The division of the MDC was to chronically weaken the opposition	102.82569885253906	338.09051513671875	10.5	277.7396697998047	30

when the MDC-M opted to back ZANU-PF rebel Simba Makoni (8.3	82.97019958496094	397.20550537109375	10.5	297.58152770996094	30

There is much detail provided about the formation of the power-	102.82569885253906	491.72650146484375	10.5	277.7900848388672	30
sharing coalition, although little that is new. However, what is fascinating	82.97019958496094	503.54949951171875	10.5	297.71189880371094	30
is Coltart’s description of his time in office as the MDC-M’s nominee to	82.97019958496094	515.3095092773438	10.5	297.68128967285156	30

Two further points: First, Coltart’s account gives copious detail of	60.345603942871094	196.34051513671875	10.5	277.8047866821289	33

There can be no quarrel with the view that Todd – who was to play	102.82569885253906	89.99652099609375	10.5	277.7271270751953	38

explicitly say so, but his yearning that history might have worked out	82.97019958496094	137.22552490234375	10.5	297.65293884277344	38

It may be argued that Bratton is a beneficiary of hindsight while	60.345611572265625	468.08050537109375	10.5	277.6357421875	43
Coltart and his MDC colleagues had to grapple with what actions to take	40.4901123046875	479.90350341796875	10.5	297.6603088378906	43
when confronted by hugely circumscribed options. In essence, as argued	40.4901123046875	491.72650146484375	10.5	297.63604736328125	43
elsewhere (for example, Southall 2013), the MDC was between a rock	40.4901123046875	503.54949951171875	10.5	297.6015319824219	43
and a hard place, and would probably have drawn extensive retrospective	40.4901123046875	515.3095092773438	10.5	297.60150146484375	43

tart remains convinced that the MDCs were correct to join the coalition,	82.97019958496094	54.52752685546875	10.5	297.5994415283203	46
he also provides ample evidence that they failed to maximise even their	82.97019958496094	66.35052490234375	10.5	297.7978973388672	46
limited opportunities. Rivalry between leading personalities allowed	82.97019958496094	78.17352294921875	10.5	297.7569122314453	46
ZANU-PF to stoke division between the two MDCs, blunting their effec-	82.9701919555664	89.99652099609375	10.5	297.7357406616211	46
tiveness. This led ultimately to their competing against each other in the	82.9701919555664	101.81951904296875	10.5	297.6843795776367	46
2013 election (always particularly damaging to minority parties under first-	82.9701919555664	113.64251708984375	10.5	297.46288299560547	46
past-the-post electoral systems). Coltart suggests that had the two MDCs	82.9701919555664	125.46551513671875	10.5	297.71382904052734	46
been able to come to some agreement, then the logical option – given	82.9701919555664	137.22552490234375	10.5	297.8409957885742	46
ZANU-PF’s blatant manipulation of the electoral regulations – would	82.9701919555664	149.04852294921875	10.5	297.72957611083984	46
have been to withdraw from the election, thereby compelling the SADC to	82.9701919555664	160.87152099609375	10.5	297.74324798583984	46
hold ZANU-PF to account. As it was, their failure to agree meant that	82.97018432617188	172.69451904296875	10.5	297.6518859863281	46
neither could withdraw from the election for fear of giving the other	82.97018432617188	184.51751708984375	10.5	297.6318664550781	46
credibility (571). In short, if this was a lost opportunity, the MDCs were	82.97018432617188	196.34051513671875	10.5	297.82098388671875	46

There is surprisingly little literature on transitional justice in Zimbabwe,	82.97019958496094	276.1080322265625	10.5	297.62037658691406	48
despite the fact that, under the terms of the GPA, the GNU established	82.97019958496094	287.9310302734375	10.5	297.73170471191406	48
the Organ for National Healing, Reconciliation, and Integration (see	82.97019958496094	299.7540283203125	10.5	297.6140594482422	48

2015). Perhaps this is because, however great the need for a serious	82.97019958496094	323.4000244140625	10.5	297.6550750732422	48

nition that the time is not ripe for any such debate to lead to meaningful	82.97019958496094	346.9830322265625	10.5	297.60362243652344	48
measures. In essence, there is popular as well as academic recognition	82.97019958496094	358.8060302734375	10.5	297.55006408691406	48
that power politics has always prevailed in Zimbabwe and continues to	82.97019958496094	370.6290283203125	10.5	297.65403747558594	48
do so. Bratton labels this “A History of Impunity,” with both colonial	82.97019958496094	382.4520263671875	10.5	297.5154571533203	48
and postcolonial regimes granting sweeping amnesties to human rights	82.97019958496094	394.2750244140625	10.5	297.5752716064453	48

versation goes away; for this reason, the contributions of both Coltart	82.97019958496094	417.9210205078125	10.5	297.55946350097656	48
and Bratton are to be warmly welcomed.	82.97019958496094	429.7440185546875	10.5	165.27525329589844	48
Coltart identifies the cult of war pursued by both colonial and post-	102.82569885253906	441.5039978027344	10.5	277.7974395751953	48
colonial regimes as having poisoned Zimbabwe’s entire society. In Zim-	82.97019958496094	453.3269958496094	10.5	297.73167419433594	48
babwe, he argues, many political protagonists are continuing to fight the	82.97019958496094	465.1499938964844	10.5	297.51756286621094	48
liberation war, as if independence never happened. The wounds of that	82.97019958496094	476.9729919433594	10.5	297.5321502685547	48
struggle have continued to fester, and while this does not justify the	82.97019958496094	488.7959899902344	10.5	297.7654266357422	48
gross abuses of human rights which have taken place since 1980, it may	82.97019958496094	500.6189880371094	10.5	297.60255432128906	48
help to explain them. “Until we have some process to enable us all to	82.97019958496094	512.4420166015625	10.5	297.72752380371094	48

While there will be those who contest his view that the war of the 1970s	82.97019958496094	536.0249633789062	10.5	297.7201385498047	48

was avoidable, there will be much wider agreement that the tragedy of	40.4901008605957	54.52752685546875	10.5	297.6329765319824	51
contemporary Zimbabwe violence “has become an acceptable means of	40.4901008605957	66.35052490234375	10.5	297.66230392456055	51

By contrast, Bratton provides us with chapter and verse of how	60.345603942871094	125.46551513671875	10.5	277.70401763916016	51
sweeping amnesties have been provided to those who have committed	40.49010467529297	137.22552490234375	10.5	297.89759063720703	51
atrocities by both the colonial and postcolonial regimes. This approach	40.49009704589844	149.04852294921875	10.5	297.60572814941406	51

batants from both sides of the independence war, effectively pre-empting	40.49009704589844	172.69451904296875	10.5	297.70860290527344	51
prosecutions or any official process to document the truth. Although	40.49009704589844	184.51751708984375	10.5	297.6728973388672	51
justified as a means to achieve national reconciliation, this allowed for no	40.49009704589844	196.34051513671875	10.5	297.7054901123047	51

of impunity was reinforced. Most notoriously, a Commission of Inquiry	40.49009704589844	243.56951904296875	10.5	297.5300750732422	51

culpability, not to mention offering any redress. This is the way it has	40.49009704589844	290.86151123046875	10.5	297.69493103027344	51

frontation. Support for war and violence has “never gained traction	82.97019958496094	165.53375244140625	10.5	297.64353942871094	56
among the vast majority of Zimbabweans” (notwithstanding, apparently,	82.97019958496094	177.35675048828125	10.5	297.6613311767578	56
those in the MDC whose desire to return ZANU-PF fire with fire so	82.97019958496094	189.17974853515625	10.5	297.66465759277344	56
dismayed Coltart during the mid-2000s). For Coltart, therefore, non-	82.97019958496094	201.00274658203125	10.5	297.52272033691406	56
violent struggle would seem to represent not just a moral imperative but	82.97019958496094	212.76275634765625	10.5	297.60572814941406	56
politically and pragmatically the only viable way to challenge ZANU-PF.	82.97019958496094	224.58575439453125	10.5	297.74427795410156	56
Furthermore, rather than awaiting another messiah (whether a Tsvangirai	82.97019958496094	236.40875244140625	10.5	297.5111541748047	56
or a Mujuru), Zimbabweans will need to place policy and principle ahead	82.97019958496094	248.23175048828125	10.5	297.6487579345703	56
of personality if they wish to see a democratic dawn (600–601).	82.97019958496094	260.05474853515625	10.5	256.2272491455078	56
We should concede that some hope of utopia is necessary if politi-	102.82569885253906	271.87774658203125	10.5	277.7196807861328	56
cal activism is to be sustained in seemingly impossible situations. But	82.97019958496094	283.70074462890625	10.5	297.72755432128906	56
what are the realistic prospects of making progress towards democracy?	82.97019958496094	295.52374267578125	10.5	297.6329803466797	56
Bratton provides some concluding thoughts that are simultaneously trite,	82.97019958496094	307.28375244140625	10.5	297.68760681152344	56
in that they are so obvious, and profound, in that Zimbabwean demo-	82.97019958496094	319.10675048828125	10.5	297.6277313232422	56
crats will only ignore them at their cost. (We may add that they are easier	82.97019958496094	330.92974853515625	10.5	297.71067810058594	56
said than done). Reflecting on the “decisive defeat” of the opposition in	82.97019958496094	342.75274658203125	10.5	297.64244079589844	56
2013, Bratton urges the MDC or successor political parties to realise that	82.97019958496094	354.57574462890625	10.5	297.7128143310547	56
political cohabitation with an entrenched incumbent will only undermine	82.97019958496094	366.39874267578125	10.5	297.62461853027344	56
opposition leaderships; there is need for ongoing party organisation,	82.97019958496094	378.22174072265625	10.5	297.54063415527344	56
especially in rural areas; opposition parties cannot afford factionalism,	82.97019958496094	390.04473876953125	10.5	297.5006866455078	56
and smaller parties should coalesce; even if external parties initiate a	82.97019958496094	401.80474853515625	10.5	297.6015167236328	56
power-sharing agreement, they will not push hard for political reform if	82.97019958496094	413.62774658203125	10.5	297.4691619873047	56
they do not feel the opposition is able to provide political order and	82.97019958496094	425.45074462890625	10.5	297.61936950683594	56
stability. For their part, civil society organisations need to put down	82.97019958496094	437.27374267578125	10.5	297.5594940185547	56
further roots into society, especially outside urban areas if they are to	82.97019958496094	449.09674072265625	10.5	297.62879943847656	56
offer education and hope that counters ZANU-PF hegemony. Finally, he	82.97019958496094	460.91973876953125	10.5	297.6560821533203	56
says, “the future of the country lies in the hands of the long-suffering	82.97019958496094	472.74273681640625	10.5	297.72755432128906	56
people of Zimbabwe” (244).	82.97019958496094	484.56573486328125	10.5	115.47900390625	56
If the bad news is that the 2013 election indicated the Zimbabwean	102.82569885253906	496.3257141113281	10.5	277.8343048095703	56
people felt the opposition parties had failed them, the good news is that	82.97019958496094	508.14874267578125	10.5	297.6666717529297	56
they have given ample indication in the past – above all, at the time of	82.97019958496094	519.9717407226562	10.5	297.6907501220703	56

the 2008 election – that they are prepared to mobilise behind popular	40.4901008605957	54.52752685546875	10.5	297.6844291687012	59

tinues. Bratton concurs, but convincingly argues that victory is far from	40.47960662841797	89.99652099609375	10.5	297.6371841430664	59
