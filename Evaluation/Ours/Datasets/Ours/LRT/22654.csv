Auerbach has stated: ‘Vampires are neither inhuman nor nonhuman nor	55.0	407.4242858886719	11.5	323.85150146484375	10
all-too-human; they are simply more alive than they should be’ (1995: 6).	55.0	419.4245300292969	11.5	323.86529541015625	10
Like his fictional ancestors, Spike blurs boundaries and raises ambiguities,	55.0	431.4247741699219	11.5	323.8606872558594	10
but he does so in a manner firmly located in today’s cultural landscape.	55.0	443.4250183105469	11.5	323.85382080078125	10
Spike joins Buffy the Vampire Slayer in Season 2 with a swagger and a	55.0	455.4252624511719	11.524078369140625	323.8514709472656	10

masculine and feminine; and his increasingly fractured self undermines	55.0	491.4259948730469	11.5	323.8583679199219	10
the Manichaean struggle which is central to so much of today’s popular	55.0	503.42626953125	11.5	323.8583679199219	10
culture.	55.0	515.426513671875	11.5	33.93534851074219	10
Spike’s character also raised important questions about the boundaries	67.00025177001953	527.4267578125	11.5	311.85701751708984	10

Spike has spawned a huge fan culture and his audience appeal suggests	55.0	575.427734375	11.5	323.85382080078125	10
that he articulates a number of cultural issues, of which this special issue	55.0	587.427978515625	11.5	323.85491943359375	10

Buffy the Vampire Slayer (aka Buffy or BtVS) first appeared in 1992 as	75.36245727539062	107.4693603515625	11.52410888671875	311.84552001953125	13
a film. It was written by Joss Whedon, directed by Fran Rubel Kuzui and	63.361053466796875	119.4696044921875	11.5	323.8549499511719	13

by day, but vampire slayer by night. The film was not a huge success, but	63.361053466796875	143.4700927734375	11.500030517578125	323.992919921875	13
in 1997 the character of Buffy returned to TV (played by Sarah Michelle	63.36104965209961	155.47036743164062	11.5	323.859561920166	13
Gellar) and became a huge hit. This time Joss Whedon was more firmly	63.36104965209961	167.47061157226562	11.5	323.8906593322754	13

director. In the words of Jane Espenson, one of the show’s writers, ‘it is so	63.36104965209961	191.47109985351562	11.5	323.8629493713379	13
Joss’s show’ (2004: 101), and it is his creative vision that has to be held to	63.36104965209961	203.47134399414062	11.5	323.85837173461914	13

Whedon has argued that it was always his intention that Buffy should	75.36129760742188	239.47207641601562	11.524078369140625	311.84320068359375	13
become an iconic show. In an oft-quoted interview he said:	63.36102294921875	251.47232055664062	11.5	258.8891906738281	13
I designed the show to create that strong reaction. I designed Buffy to be an	75.36219787597656	270.1966857910156	10.52197265625	311.84373474121094	14
icon, to be an emotional experience, to be loved in a way that other shows can’t	75.36221313476562	282.1971435546875	10.5	311.8542175292969	14
be loved. Because it’s about adolescence, which is the most important thing	75.36221313476562	294.1976013183594	10.5	311.8583984375	14
people go through in their development, becoming an adult. And it mythol-	75.36221313476562	306.19805908203125	10.5	311.8531188964844	14
ogizes it in such a way, such a romantic way – it basically says, ‘Everybody who	75.36221313476562	318.1985168457031	10.5	311.8489685058594	14
made it through adolescence is a hero.’ And I think that’s very personal, that	75.36221313476562	330.198974609375	10.5	311.855224609375	14

But what exactly is Buffy the Vampire Slayer? Apart from the reasons given	55.0	395.46844482421875	11.524078369140625	323.8514709472656	20

phenomenal success? As stated in the show’s title, Buffy herself is the	54.99884796142578	419.46893310546875	11.5	323.86067962646484	20
‘vampire slayer’. In the mythology of the series, this means that she is the	54.99884796142578	431.46917724609375	11.5	323.86644744873047	20
one girl who has been chosen to defend the world: as the opening voiceover	54.99884796142578	443.46942138671875	11.5	323.8629379272461	20

on a passionate but soulless relationship. When she finally renounces this	55.0	359.4745178222656	11.5	323.85491943359375	25

departing for Africa where, after a series of trials, he is able to win back his	55.0	395.4752502441406	11.5	323.8618469238281	25

fractured subjectivity: the idea that we have not one, but multiple	55.0	227.47183227539062	11.5	323.8549499511719	32

reader. Seeking to supersede the vampire chronicles of Anne Rice as the	63.363372802734375	263.46893310546875	11.5	323.8572998046875	36

portrayal offered by Rice. But at the same time the show acknowledges her	63.36451721191406	287.46942138671875	11.5	323.8560028076172	36

at the point in time at which we encounter these two it is he, not Angel,	63.3645133972168	359.47088623046875	11.5	323.8571968078613	36
who takes the role of the modernized, sceptical vampire who does not	63.36451721191406	371.47113037109375	11.5	323.85606384277344	36
abide by the traditionally sanctioned vampire law embodied by Lestat (see	63.36451721191406	383.47137451171875	11.5	323.8629913330078	36
Gelder, 1994). This is summed up in Spike’s penultimate line in ‘School	63.36451721191406	395.47161865234375	11.5	323.8882598876953	36

more fun around here’. Much later in the show’s history (in a flashback in	63.36451721191406	419.47210693359375	11.5	323.85374450683594	36

we find that, on becoming a vampire, one of Spike’s first acts is to ‘sire’ his	63.36451721191406	443.47259521484375	11.5	323.8515167236328	36

Yet the show subsequently denies the erotic reading of the Angel/Spike	75.36299896240234	479.46893310546875	11.5	311.85697174072266	36

Siring has always been a metaphor for sexual intercourse, as Rice’s	63.36274337768555	503.46942138671875	11.5	323.8526496887207	36
description of Louis’ siring at the hands of Lestat makes clear. Gelder	63.36274337768555	515.4696655273438	11.5	323.86186599731445	36
comments that Lestat ‘takes’ Louis like a lover in a ‘drawn-out ecstatic	63.36274337768555	527.4699096679688	11.5	323.85612869262695	36

kinship in the ‘Buffyverse’ is that queer kinship extends beyond vampire	55.00115966796875	251.47232055664062	11.5	323.86297607421875	39

various kinds which negotiate the reproduction of life and the demands of	67.0	312.1971435546875	10.5	311.85418701171875	40

forms of human dependency, which may include birth, child-rearing, relations	67.0	336.19805908203125	10.5	311.8510437011719	40

that Spike is both constructed and read through these historical and inter-	63.36219787597656	71.4686279296875	11.5	323.8549041748047	45

ways. For example, unlike previous incarnations of the vampire, the cult	63.36219787597656	95.4691162109375	11.5	323.8595428466797	45

textual and sub-textual nature of the show is revealed most through	63.36220169067383	167.47061157226562	11.5	323.8525810241699	45

fiction’ written by fans. In this sense the text offers the polymorphous	63.36220169067383	203.47134399414062	11.5	323.8595390319824	45
sexuality (through Spike) that is usually the realm of erotic fan fiction.	63.36220169067383	215.47158813476562	11.5	313.21516036987305	45
In the second piece in this volume, Amy-Chinn argues that this poly-	75.3624496459961	227.47183227539062	11.5	311.85352325439453	45
morphous sexuality is one of the many ways in which Spike transgresses	63.36219787597656	239.47207641601562	11.5	323.85142517089844	45
boundaries. She contends that Spike does not simply subvert gender norms	63.36219787597656	251.47232055664062	11.5	323.8538055419922	45
or sexual norms, but that Spike is ‘queer’. Amy-Chinn deconstructs the	63.36219787597656	263.4725646972656	11.5	323.8538055419922	45
artificial boundary between gender and sexuality through which trans-	63.36219787597656	275.4728088378906	11.5	323.8572540283203	45
gression has previously been theorized in order to demonstrate that	63.36219787597656	287.4730529785156	11.5	323.86070251464844	45
Spike’s ‘queerness’ operates through his erotic mobility. Spike’s sexuality	63.36219787597656	299.4732971191406	11.5	323.8606414794922	45

excessive masculinity and active femininity. Yet while his biological	63.36219787597656	323.4737854003906	11.5	323.85838317871094	45

Chinn examines not only the ways in which Spike switches between male	63.36219787597656	347.4742736816406	11.5	323.8584442138672	45
and female, but also his ability to accommodate ‘vanilla’ sex and erotic	63.36219787597656	359.4745178222656	11.5	323.8572235107422	45

For example, Spike’s relationship with Buffy is often based on Spike	75.3624496459961	383.4750061035156	11.5	311.85587310791016	45
taking the traditional ‘woman’s part’ (a desire for intimacy) and Buffy	63.36219787597656	395.4752502441406	11.5	323.8538055419922	45
taking the ‘man’s part’ (sex followed by flight) and it is one based on	63.36219787597656	407.4754943847656	11.5	323.8583526611328	45
polymorphous sexual desire on both their parts. Spike refuses to define	63.36219787597656	419.4757385253906	11.5	323.86180114746094	45
their encounters as abject or degrading, despite the fact that he is rejected	63.36219787597656	431.4759826660156	11.5	323.86183166503906	45
and abused by Buffy. But, Amy-Chinn argues, it is the power imbalance in	63.36219787597656	443.4762268066406	11.5	323.8572235107422	45
their relationship (with Buffy firmly in the driving seat), rather than their	63.36219787597656	455.4764709472656	11.5	323.8595733642578	45
unconventional and socially unacceptable sex life, that makes their	63.36219787597656	467.4767150878906	11.5	323.8606719970703	45
relationship a failure. She also insists that the show has an ambivalent	63.36219787597656	479.4769592285156	11.5	323.8538055419922	45
attitude to the ‘queerness’ it depicts by locating it in Spike, who for most	63.3621940612793	491.4772033691406	11.5	323.8629341125488	45
of the seven seasons is a figure of revulsion. However, Amy-Chinn suggests	63.3621940612793	503.4774169921875	11.5	323.8629341125488	45
that for all of its hesitations, the depiction of Spike is one that contributes	63.3621940612793	515.4776611328125	11.5	323.8537788391113	45
to the breakdown of gender oppositions, and to the visibility of uncon-	63.3621940612793	527.4779052734375	11.5	323.8561592102051	45

matrix and contributing to the ‘thinkability’ of traditionally taboo	63.3621940612793	551.4784545898438	11.5	323.8560981750488	45

In the third article, Abbott elaborates upon the way in which Spike	75.36244201660156	575.4789428710938	11.5	311.85813903808594	45

fractured self that overreaches this binary opposition. Through an analysis	55.0	83.4688720703125	11.5	323.89752197265625	48

Vampire Slayer, Abbott demonstrates that Spike undergoes the most	55.0	107.4693603515625	11.52410888671875	323.8514709472656	48

that this is effected through the presentation of multiple Spikes, a self that	55.00000762939453	131.4698486328125	11.5	323.8618392944336	48

overtly addressed within the narrative and dialogue of the show. She	55.00000762939453	191.47109985351562	11.5	323.8514938354492	48
relates this to the deconstruction of Spike’s leather-clad bad-boy biker	55.000003814697266	203.47134399414062	11.5	323.86184310913086	48

a different visual look. Abbott examines how these multiple selves operate	55.000003814697266	227.47183227539062	11.5	323.85610580444336	48
to push the narrative forward in the final season, arguing that it is only	55.000003814697266	239.47207641601562	11.5	323.85033798217773	48

Hills and Williams’ piece shifts the discussion from one which	67.00025177001953	311.4735412597656	11.5	311.86156463623047	48

with, the character Spike, to one which examines the relationship	55.0	335.4740295410156	11.5	323.85955810546875	48
between the character and the meanings attached to him by the actor who	55.0	347.4742736816406	11.5	323.85260009765625	48
plays him, James Marsters. Hills and Williams argue that Marsters’	55.0	359.4745178222656	11.5	323.8583984375	48
impact on our understanding of his character is ‘situated’. By this they	55.0	371.4747619628906	11.5	323.8652648925781	48
mean that Marsters does have agency in terms of interpreting Spike (both	55.0	383.4750061035156	11.5	323.8618469238281	48
on-screen and off), but that this is tempered by his role in the hierarchy of	55.0	395.4752502441406	11.5	323.8583679199219	48
production (wracked as it is with internal struggles) in which he does not	55.0	407.4754943847656	11.5	323.85723876953125	48
have an entirely ‘free hand’ in the performance of his star persona. Hills	55.0	419.4757385253906	11.5	323.8560791015625	48
and Williams consider Marsters to be a ‘subcultural celebrity’, by which	55.0	431.4759826660156	11.5	323.8561096191406	48
they mean a celebrity specific to the audience and fandom surrounding	55.0	443.4762268066406	11.5	323.8607177734375	48
Buffy the Vampire Slayer, rather than by general star recognition. There is	55.0	455.4764709472656	11.524078369140625	323.843505859375	48

not only to merge actor and character, but which also make Marsters	54.99999237060547	491.4772033691406	11.5	323.85608673095703	48

and ‘celebrity’. Key to this intervention is Marsters’ self-styled acces-	54.99999237060547	515.4776611328125	11.5	323.85840606689453	48
sibility to his fans. His positive encounters with fans having been	54.99999237060547	527.4779052734375	11.5	323.85840606689453	48

nice guy and enigmatic persona. In addition, rather than seeing celebrity	54.99999237060547	551.4784545898438	11.5	323.86072540283203	48

This special issue closes with a commentary by Vivien Burr on the 2004	75.36219787597656	143.4700927734375	11.500030517578125	311.89146423339844	52
Slayage Conference on Buffy the Vampire Slayer held in Nashville in May	63.36194610595703	155.47036743164062	11.524078369140625	323.84920501708984	52
2004, and combines ethnographic analysis with reflection on the	63.361968994140625	167.47061157226562	11.5	323.8572692871094	52
fan–scholar divide that has been the subject of much academic attention	63.361968994140625	179.47085571289062	11.5	323.8618469238281	52
(for example, Burt, 1998; Doty, 2000; Frith, 1990; Hills, 2002; Jenkins,	63.361968994140625	191.47109985351562	11.5	323.8560485839844	52
1992; Michael, 2000). In his own reflections on the conference, one of the	63.361968994140625	203.47134399414062	11.5	323.85723876953125	52
organizers, David Lavery (2004), talks about almost 400 Buffy scholar-fans	63.361968994140625	215.47158813476562	11.524078369140625	323.8446044921875	52
and fan-scholars ‘having the time of their lives talking about, dissecting,	63.361968994140625	227.47183227539062	11.5	323.8652648925781	52
and singing about a show they love beyond the possibility to describe’.	63.361968994140625	239.47207641601562	11.5	323.85723876953125	52
Lavery is responding to criticism by Levine and Schneider (2003) in	63.361968994140625	251.47232055664062	11.5	323.84918212890625	52
‘Feeling for Buffy: The Girl Next Door’ that Buffy scholars are so in love	63.361968994140625	263.4725646972656	11.524078369140625	323.8480529785156	52
with the show that their scholarship is often unreflective, narrow and	63.36199951171875	275.4728088378906	11.5	323.8549499511719	52
mistaken.	63.36199951171875	287.4730529785156	11.5	42.95018768310547	52
Yet Burr calls into questions Lavery’s emotive response to Levine and	75.36225128173828	299.4732971191406	11.5	311.8593063354492	52
Schnieder’s criticism noting that she, and several other conference atten-	63.36199951171875	311.4735412597656	11.5	323.8560485839844	52
dees who responded to her enquiries, felt stirrings of unease when it was	63.36199951171875	323.4737854003906	11.5	323.8653259277344	52
mentioned that thought had been given to inviting a member of Buffy’s	63.36199951171875	335.4740295410156	11.524078369140625	323.8446044921875	52
cast to the conference. Moreover, she notes that sessions did, on occasion,	63.36199951171875	347.4742736816406	11.5	323.85498046875	52
veer away from academic analysis into heated discussion on topics that did	63.36199951171875	359.4745178222656	11.5	323.8641662597656	52
not seem to fit into a scholarly environment. She notes, in particular that	63.361995697021484	371.4747619628906	11.5	323.862979888916	52
emotions ran high on the subject of Spike – and that any scholar	63.361995697021484	383.4750061035156	11.5	323.851505279541	52
presenting a paper that sought to criticize the character was met with	63.361995697021484	395.4752502441406	11.5	323.8537940979004	52
considerable hostility. This, of course, is to show precisely that lack of	63.361995697021484	407.4754943847656	11.5	323.8905372619629	52
critical distance for which Levine and Schneider so roundly condemn	63.361995697021484	419.4757385253906	11.5	323.854923248291	52
Buffy studies.	63.361995697021484	431.4759826660156	11.524078369140625	59.5090446472168	52
Burr does not attempt to address the reasons why Spike is such a site of	75.36224365234375	443.4762268066406	11.5	311.8592529296875	52
contention among fan-scholars and scholar-fans and we were intrigued,	63.36199188232422	455.4764709472656	11.5	323.86185455322266	52
although not surprised, that this was the case. Rather, it confirmed to us	63.36199188232422	467.4767150878906	11.5	323.85037994384766	52
that there was indeed something about Spike that resonated with fans and	63.36199188232422	479.4769592285156	11.5	323.85611724853516	52
scholars of the show in a way not found in the other supporting characters,	63.36199188232422	491.4772033691406	11.5	323.86414337158203	52
and that this warranted an in-depth analysis.	63.36199188232422	503.4774169921875	11.5	198.56244659423828	52
As far as we are aware, despite the huge volume of Buffy and Angel	75.36224365234375	515.4776611328125	11.52410888671875	311.8443298339844	52

single, supporting character of the shows has been the focus of an	63.363128662109375	539.4782104492188	11.5	323.8549499511719	52
academic endeavour. We hope that the articles in this issue convince the	63.363128662109375	551.4784545898438	11.5	323.86297607421875	52
reader that Spike is worth both the accolade and the effort.	63.363128662109375	563.4786987304688	11.5	260.2645568847656	52
