By combining allochronism and heteronomy, we have coined the newterm of ‘heterochrony’ to express the situation in which a given group does not have thecapacity of choosing its own laws and the cognitive means to think of itself and where suchsituation is due to reasons of different time location (in that case in a backward situation)than other autonomous groups. Such heterochrony might lead to a halt of transnationalcooperation in Europe and have negative impacts on the self-perception of Europe.KeywordsEuropean identity, European memory, symbolic other, othering process, 1989, path-dependency, neo-institutionalism, allochronism, heterochrony, western Europe, Centraland Eastern Europe, history, self-understanding of Europe.21. Introduction: Othering process, cognitive means and time.We will discuss in this paper the view that the enlarged European Union we now live in andwhich we intellectually perceive is as much the direct result of 1989 than it is of the efforts to createthe first European Communities in the 1950s. The breaking apart of the Communist block usheredin a new era for a political Europe where positive features (EU enlargement commenced in 1995 byincorporating the hitherto ‘neutral’ states of Austria, Finland and Sweden, not to mention the 2004and 2007 enlargements) coexist with more problematic ones (unsolved security agreements betweenthe EU and Russia, some occidentalist reductionist ways of describing Eastern Europe in urgentneed to catch up with (Western) Europe, or the stumbling bocks still existing between East andWest on the debate of a common European memory). One could say that 1989 ‘made’ Europe, butin an imperfect manner. So, what has been the impact of European integration on 1989? Priorwestern European integration facilitated and legitimated, it may be surmised, the notion of a ‘returnto Europe’ voiced by the dissidents and revolutionaries in the Soviet bloc as well as theGorbachevian notion of a Common European Home. Yet, how was the transformation of Europeafter 1989 constrained and enabled by the pre-existence of a common western political project?1989 ‘made’ Europe because what was hitherto a divided continent now became united.More specifically, the revolutions of 1989 brought in their wake German unity. Negotiationsregarding German unification and the integration of this new Germany into western structures wereto change fundamentally the reality and the idea of Europe. One could say that Germany epitomizesthe problem of an enlarged Europe Union to 27 members: by incorporating the eastern part into thewestern part of the FRG, the historical experience and identity of the GDR tended to be written offand to disappear (and quite symptomatically, they are dubbed the ‘new’ Länder so as to insist thatthings had be started anew there) based on the assumption that they had little, or simply nothing tooffer to the western experience or ways of doing politics and of imagining itself.We will argue that a same phenomenon has happened between EU15 (western Europe) andthe new 12 EU member states: 15+12 may have created an enlarged EU that is now indeedstructurally integrated (or in the continuous process of complete integration), but the ways in whichEU15/West Germany used to imagine their/its counterpart(s) during the Cold War period haveprofoundly influenced the ways in which ‘east’ Europe has been and still is thought nowadays(hence the ideational divergences that this conference tries to tackle). Put differently, the process ofideational convergence that EU enlargement should have carried through and fulfilled in the period1989-2004 was profoundly and negatively affected by an occidentalist bias in which theGDR/Eastern Europe was thought not on the basis of its own merit, features or characteristics but asthe negative Other of an integrating Western Europe. ‘Othering’ mechanisms most frequentlycontribute to simplifications and negative stereotypes, and this paper will discuss some of thesemechanisms and their consequences in the power relation between eastern and western Europe. Ofinterest for us here will be the case of collective memory around European themes, politicalcontributions to a European acquis and questions of collective autonomy, and how 1989 has been aturning point in such problematic mutual perceptions between Eastern and Western Europe. Thepaper will not discuss the institutional arrangements of post-1989 EU life but dwells at length onideational and cognitive issues for two reasons. One because ‘Europe’ (as a political project) needsto rethink itself if it wants to be more inclusive and more democracy-friendly (the self-reflectivedimension of Europe). Second, because for individuals and state to feel as fully equals within the3European realms need not just to have the same access to EU institutions but should also have equalaccess to cognitive means1 (the capacity of auto-institution on the cognitive level).Of central concern in this paper is the study of certain discourses articulated around deepdifferences between East/West and favoring dichotomous understanding of Europe. We will try tounderstand why such discourses occur, what are their meanings and discuss some of their examples,a famous illustration being that of Norman Davies when he dissects the division ‘East and WestEurope’. In that perspective (and in his critique the occidentalistic-cum-orientalistic framework)Norman Davies shows how the famous curriculum course on ‘Western Civilisation’ introducessloppy reasoning and judgemental dualisms of the following kind:1. That the western and eastern halves of Europe are separate entities with little or nothing incommon.2. That Eastern Europe is not really part of Europe, or not part of ‘the real Europe’.3. That the East-West division of Europe, which can be observed in different manifestations atdifferent times, is fixed and permanent.4. That ‘the West’ is superior.5. That all summaries of Western civilisation / European history can safely omit anything whichbelongs to the different and inferior East. (The only exception to this rule is Russia, which,being powerful, automatically qualifies for inclusion.) (Davies 2006: 60).This type of idea is also somehow embedded in much of the political science literature dealing withdemocratization and civil society promotion. There, one can find similar biases simply in the factthat ‘transition’ has to be managed from outside by western donors (instead of counting on localforces), or that civil society often has to be constructed and engineered into the right type ofpolitical participation (rather than leaving the existing institution choosing their own course ofaction and rhetoric to do so).2Attila Melegh, in a recent stimulant book, questions also such dualisms and argues that anEast-West slope runs across the self-perception of Europe. This slope implies a sense of normativejudgment where the west is the positive endpoint of the slope (embodied by a liberal humanitarianutopia) that easterners of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) are supposed to climb to reach‘freedom’, ‘democracy’, ‘market economy’ and the like, while on the lower end, an abnormal Eastis trailing behind in a state of ‘backwardness’ in which the legacy of the past or ‘incompletenationalisms’3 weighs heavily (Melegh 2006: 1-3). Melegh’s point is obviously not to ‘measure’ atwhich points various countries, institutions or individuals are positioned onto this slope, but “israther how these ‘East-West slopes’ based on the idea of diminishing civilization toward the ‘East’enable the translations of ‘liberal humanitarian utopias’ onto a global scale and how the relatedidentity structures actually operate and transform themselves into social and political action orindividual narratives in the context of Central and Eastern Europe” (ibid: 2). In other words thisimaginary slope has a constitutive role in the self-perception and self-understanding of people ofand involved with Central and Eastern Europe.We will argue in this paper that European construction (around the EU, alternatively referredto as ‘Europe’ as oppose to Europe, the geographical space independent of the political Union) andenlargement of the EU towards East imply a form of subtle and untold domination of the Western1 I draw here inspiration on the work of Castoriadis for whom autonomy is not just a political autonomy a la Rousseau,but also the capacity to choose its cognitive means to do so (Castoriadis 1986, 1997 and 1999). We will develop laterthis point in the part dealing with heterochrony. See in particular Section 3.b.2 For a critique of this Promothean conception of democracy and civil society promotion which does not considerenough local resources and that has negative social effects, see, e.g., Hann & Dunn (1997) and Mendelson (2002).3 For an overview of the alleged defect of Eastern European nationalisms, see Todorova (2005).4part of the continent subtlety and at times unconsciously by institutions of the EU or by academicdiscourses on Central and Eastern Europe. Such domination, bordering at times with coloniality4 asan unintended consequence, is best explored on the ideational level and through the central role that1989 has taken in this process. That there was a relation of power between the EU and (soon to be)candidate Eastern European states in the period 1989-2004 is out of doubt (one just needs to thinkof the Copenhagen criteria to respect in order to become part of the club). The sub-hypotheses weare exploring here is that domination is not a conscious fact but a consequence of institutionalpractices rooted in a European community born during the Cold War and of certain academicdevices reinforcing divides between social groups (in our case, the ‘east’ and the ‘west’). In thisprocess, 1989 plaid a particular role by leaving a lasting imprint on official discourses on EasternEurope and influenced by a reading of Communism having atomized and destroyed all positiveconstitutive elements in Eastern Europe that had no other issue but to catch up and emulate thewestern ways of doing.Such view can be found elsewhere nowadays in some of the debates about a Europeanmemory and historical representation of Europe. To advance a metaphor, we could say that on thetheme of European memory and identity, there is a sort of East-West slope running across thecontinent where, e.g. Eastern Europe still needs to come to term with the Holocaust and still needsto do some work on its collective history with regard to the extermination of Jews.5 We argue thatthere is a slope here as well, because differences in the Vergangenheitsbewältigungen tend to beexpressed not only in normative term (‘they must come to term with this problem’, or ‘they havenot done their homework’, etc.), but also in terms of different time locations (‘they are trailing backon the work on memory, etc). Johannes Fabian, in his important albeit little quoted work on Timeand the Other (1983), underlines that one of the favorite ways for anthropology to ‘make itsobjects’ is through time and what he terms ‘denial of coevalness’ (Fabian 1983: 32) or‘allochronism’ (from the Greek ‘allos’ for ‘other, and ‘xronos’ for time). Allochronism could bedefined as the (usually forced) positioning of one’s group in a different time than that of thereference group. His thesis is that “anthropology has emerged and established itself as anallochronic discourse; it is a science of other men in another Time. It is a discourse whose referenthas been removed from the present of the speaking/writing subject” (ibid.: 143).Although Fabian criticizes the discipline of anthropology (for its contribution to therealization of colonialism), his arguments runs parallel to that of Melegh, when the former sustainsthat anthropology “promoted a scheme in terms of which not only past cultures, but all livingsocieties were irrevocably placed on a temporal slope, a stream of Time—some upstream, othersdownstream. Civilization, evolution, development, acculturation, modernization (and their cousins,industrialization, urbanization) are all terms whose conceptual content devices, in ways that can bespecified, from evolutionary time” (Fabian 1983: 17). The problem with such allochronism andslope-metaphor is not that they ascribe people definitively to a certain place, or position on the scaleof civilization or of Erinnerungsarbeit, but that they create artificial distances between differentgroups and that they ‘otherize’ given social groups. They put certain groups in a more active (theone judging the time location and deciding of the allochronism) or passive stance (the group laggingbehind6). The negative results for the group at a lower end of such othering process and delineation4 Melegh defines colonialty as “a system of power understood as a complex form of domination, including thehierarchical classification of the populations of the planet, the reformulation of local concepts of space and time, theexport of sexual energies into the ‘East’, the ‘imperial gaze’ and most importantly the colonization of consciousness.The latter point can be summed up as ‘an energy and a machinery to transform differences into values’ and as theconsequence ‘subalternization of knowledge and societies” (Melegh 2006: 29. His emphasis).5 See Troebst’s seminal papers (2005, 2006 and 2007) on that matter.6 Todorova (2005: 163f) also uses the concept of allochronism with regard to a certain analysis of the temporalities ofEastern European nationalisms.5process between active/passive, modern/traditional is first that, as Melegh argues, it affects the self-understanding of such people leading to discriminatory or racist views, and second that itdisempowers them putting them in a situation of heteronomy7. By combining allochronism andheteronomy, we have coined the new term of ‘heterochrony’ to express the situation in which agiven group does not have the capacity of choosing its own laws and the cognitive means to thinkof itself and where such situation is due to reasons of different time location (in that case in abackward situation) than other autonomous groups. Let us see now how such theme can be found inthe post-1989 phase, how this has become an institutional problem and how it relates to the questionof European memory.2. Three questions on 1989, Europe: Directions and PluralitiesIf there was an impact of 1989 on European ‘integration’8, there is probably also somereflections to gain from the following reversed question: What has been the impact of Europeanintegration on 1989? In other words, has the transformation of a post-1989 eastern Europe beenconstrained by the pre-existence of a common western political project, west of the Iron Curtain? Ifso, how? To give short answers to this question, we will resort to three sub-questions.The first question: Has there been an impact of 1989 on European Integration? If so, ofwhat kind? This is well beyond the scope of this paper, and 1989 surely had a variety of impacts onEuropean integration and European societies at large. A short answer, easier to give now that the2004 and 2007 enlargements took place is that the collapse of Iron Curtain has allowed the entry offormer communist as well as some neutral countries into the EEC/EU. 1989 has, in a way, given anew impetus towards a revamped and enlarged common ‘European House’ (to take the phrase ofGorbatchov). But why was it that ‘Europe’ became the roof for integration of a post-1989 easternEurope? This leads us to the second question.What has been the impact of European integration on 1989? The response, thoughseemingly tautological, is simply another wave of ‘European integration’, yet of another kind. Sincethe EEC was one of the most effective supra-national political institutions at the time of the collapseof the Soviet empire, the model of European integration provided a direct blueprint or a clearhorizon for eastern Europe (hence the (problematic) notion shared by many that there was a ‘returnto Europe’). The process is what is referred to in neo-institutionalist parlance as a case of path-dependency. Once the project of an effective European community was re-launched in the 1980sand that political momentum was given towards further integration by the 1987 Single Act, theexisting and already expanding European institution was the natural candidate at the time of theSoviet collapse to preside over renewed collaboration between East and West. Other ‘pan-European’ institutions existed and mattered already back then, like NATO, Conference for Securityand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the Council of Europe, but since the post-1989 taskincluded also the question of German re-unification (a still very sour point to many European statesback in 1989, and an issue that had driven a decisive wedge in the East-West relationship in the7 To define heteronomy, we will tap again into the work of Castoriadis. Autonomy, as pointed earlier, is the capacity tochoose its own laws and the cognitive means to do so. An autonomous society is one that has the capacity of auto-institution, that is the capacity for societies to openly ‘call into question their own institution, their representation of theworld, their social imaginary significations’ (Castoriadis 1997: 17).In an heteronymous society, there is no capacity to choose its laws and/or there is closure on the cognitive level. Byclosure Castoriadis means that a given society does not have the possibilities to choose the ways and means in whichthey reflect about themselves. Closure implies the law of others imposed on this society.8 The term ‘integration’ would be discussing since it is highly contentious. For a discussion of the term ‘integration’ seethe work on US-influence on the first steps of European construction in Winand (1993) and Aldrich (1997).6nascent cold war in the late 1940s), the issue of East-West unification had to be subordinated to apolitical forum with binding supra-national powers and in which the USA could have a say.9 NATOcould not be such a forum (because of its military nature and the reluctance of the Soviet Union/CISto abandon all of its sphere of influence—although NATO was also part of the discussion back in1989, as much as it is still part of the problem in Europe now if one just looks at the stand offbetween Russia and Europe on the question of Georgia this Summer), while the Council of Europeand the CSCE (transformed in 1994 into the OSCE) were only too loose inter-governmentalinstitutions to be able to decide on such important matters. Moreover, as observes Delcour (2008),by the time of the Wall collapse, the EEC was already engaged in managing a flow of aid to Polandand Hungary and therefore the EEC was the natural candidate to cope with the task of helpingEastern Europe out of planed economy and of bureaucratic dictatorships.Why would path-dependency be important in this phase of transition? Because institutions(such as that of the EEC and EU) have their development constrained by past learning processesand organizational memories rather than by totally new external impetuses.10 In our case, theinstitutional lasting imprint we will look is that of the cold war vision of Eastern Europe (SeeIllutration 2 below) that had been totally destroyed by the Soviet domination and which wastherefore to be rebuild and reconstruct from scratch.11 The EEC (soon to become EU) which waswell active by 1989 as an inter-governmental forum, and which in part had just started working withsome Central European countries, was therefore the natural candidate to oversee the re-birth of‘Europe’, east and west alike, launching a new phase of European integration. This leads us to thethird level of questioning, which has to do with the nature of ‘Europe’, as a political project, and theconsequences of this dominant position acquired in 1989 by ‘Europe’ which was born out of thewestern European experience of integration.What has been the impact of a pre-existent integrated political western Europe for easternEurope? ‘Europe’, as a political project born of the creation of the first communities in the 1950s(European Coal and Steel Community, European Economic Community, EURATOM) was not a‘neutral’ or ‘technocratic’ project, but was clearly a political project favoured and largely funded bythe USA in the immediate post-WW2 period (Aldrich 1997). If one wants therefore to understandwhat has been the impact of a pre-existent political Europe (EEC) on the post-1989 Europe, one hasto understand not only the EEC in the 1980s but also the origins of this political Europe, for itcarries in seeds certain traits of the 1950s that might be (or have been) detrimental towards easternEurope four or five decades later. It is thus important to understand the biases that ‘Europe’ hasboth for eastern Europe and for Europe as a geographical entity. It is puzzling to note, first of all,how the term “Europe” is now widely referred to as a short cut for a political Europe embodied nowby the EU, yet, when one opens a history book on Europe, very little will be said about this politicalEurope, or that it is not so well ‘integrated’ with the history of European states (just to take two9 On how the USA’s influence over Europe gradually vanished from the 1980s onwards, see Lundestad (2003).10 On path-dependency and neo-institutionalism in general, see DiMaggio & Powell (1991: in particular pp. 192ff).11 One could argue that path-dependency is also important here because the nature of European construction has been toturn its back to a past of national antagonism and enmity (e.g. France vs Germany) and to construct a positivecollaborative project instead. The period 1989-1991 is another moment where Europe is reluctant to look at a certainpast of rather unorthodox cooperation in the field of military cooperation in the shadow of the NATO and of unpleasantalliances and flirts with extreme right-wing groups in Western Europe. The so-called GLADIO network of stay-behindarmies in case of Soviet invasion was behind the strategy of tension by western European governments in the 1960s and1970s. Ganser (2005) discusses at length these networks. It is interesting to see that these were partly made publicaround 1990 and 1991, but passed the Fall 1991, all European governments then refused to participate and comment ontheir existence. Can this be another impact of 1989, namely a sort of Flucht nach vorn to avoid to deal with westernEuropean sore experience and concentrate on enlargement instead?7examples, we can quote the work of Tony Judt (2005)12 or Harold James (2003), where the questionof European integration occupies only a tiny portion of their influential works on Europe taken as ageographical aggregation of nation-states). So there is a discrepancy between the avowed goal of apolitical Europe to represent an integrated physical Europe in general and the place granted to thispolitical project in historical works (and probably in the mind of most Europeans). This discrepancyis nonetheless interesting for us because it indicates that the political project of ‘Europe’ has beentrying to project the idea of a common European fate as a basis for a full integration.13 It is thisproject, that one could qualify as hegemonic since it tends to erase other narratives and tendstowards its own satisfaction via diverse institutional means. ‘Europe’ disposes of many ways andinstitutions through which it can diffuse its visions of ‘Europe’. These institutions take variousforms, mostly cognitive ones by playing on European symbols, historical memory, etc. although thefinancial aspect is no less important, with massive projects on European identity, history, funded bythe Commission over the last ten or fifteen years. Interestingly, the two declarations by the EEC/EUdealing explicitly with the need to bolster a common European identity were passed by the EEC in1973 (Copenhagen Declaration) and in 1983 (Stuttgart Declaration), well before the end of the ColdWar and in a period where ‘Europe’ meant western Europe.14The surge of such literature on a ‘cultural’ Europe is one manifestation of a rather recentway of conceiving of ‘Europe’ as a place allegedly sharing a same cultural stratum.15 If we take therepresentation of European construction in a selection of European textbooks, we can see that thereis a Europeanisation of the historical representation of ‘Europe’. By Europeanisation, we mean thatwe are not only witnessing the drafting of a common supra-national curriculum around Europe andthe publication of common European textbooks in France and Germany,16 but also that there is aconvergence in terms of what ‘Europe’ is about: National different views about Europeanconstruction gradually vanish and leave place to a common narrative around a cultural Europe(Challand 2009). 1989 is presented as an important unfolding moment for ‘Europe’ since it offeredthe possibility for eastern Europe to converge and follow the path of western Europe.The following map (Illustration 1) exemplify this occidentalist vision of Eastern Europewhose future depends on the west: once the Soviet block collapsed, Eastern Europe defined as‘Balkanised’ will gradually transform (‘Occidentalise’ itself) and thus become an extension ofwestern Europe (and here of the broader political environment of the post-9/11 era).12 Although, interestingly for our Conference, Judt’s narration precisely starts in December 1989.13 On the European identity debate, see Stråth (2005, 2007), Larat (2005), etc.14 On the timing of such declarations, see Shore (2000).15 I am grateful to Chris Amrbruster for observing that this literature on a cultural Europe is also an effect of 1989 andthe ‘return to Europe’. The cultural claim to Europe could be made most easily from CEE on the basis of religion, art,literature and so on because other political and economic claims to Europeanness across the whole continent wereperceived as weak. Back to a certain idea of ‘slope’.16 See e.g. Delouche, F., & al. (1992). Histoire de l'Europe. Paris: Hachette, or Delouche, F., & al. (1997). Histoire del'Europe. Paris: Hachette.Illustration 1: The Impact of 1989, seen from a French History Textbook8Source: Binoist, B., & al. (2004). Histoire. Terminales ES et L (1st ed.). Paris: Magnard, p. 147Such occidentalist representation mirrors what we have called earlier the lasting imprint ofcold war visions of Eastern Europe and, which, in a way, pre-announces a hegemonic westernEuropean agenda on defining it. Illustration 217 is a political poster of 1952 calling for the creationof the European Defence Community (a plan later voted downby the French Parliament in 1954). One sees that unity isneeded to protect against the flood of red blood (a common wayto refer to the communist threat), which tries to break into apeaceful and blossoming land. Europe is here still a looseunderstanding of anti-communism and not uniquely of the Sixfirst member states (the banners listed here is more than those ofthe Six who joined the ECSC in 1951). While there is prosperitywest of this ‘wall’, east of it, there is nothing but a turmoil ofdestruction and havoc provoked by the red peril. Let us now seemore into details how the institutionally hegemonic viewsfavoured by (western) ‘Europe’ tends to be problematic for apost-1989 Europe.Illustration 2: West-German posterfor a European DefenceCommunity, 1952.17 Reproduced in Funken, W., & Koltrowitz, B.

Projecting EuropeProjecting the integration of Europe on the basis of a common fate (and we touch here onthe theme of the self-reflective dimension of Europe outlined in the introduction) is problematic inthree senses.3.a) Negative Western stereotypes of CEE as a land of emptiness?First, in this vision of an always expanding (western) political Europe, it is as though easternEurope does not have anything to offer to European integration. In the three questions I have raisedabove, it is as though eastern Europe was the land of emptiness, with no wealth, knowledge,institutions, or history upon which a post-1989 Europe could draw resources, only the passivereceptacles of information, good practices and projects to be funded by Brussels (Illustration 1perfectly matches this distorted reading). But is it the case that eastern Europe was so void of anyinternal resources for the project of European integration? Surely, the imposition of Sovietizationand Stalinism had dire consequences in terms of cult of personality, control of the Communist Partyand loss of economic, political or cultural autonomy. Yet, there were diverse attempts withineastern Europe to remodel socialism with a human face or to propose autonomy with differentforms (certain writings of Castoriadis (1976) such as the The Hungarian Source are reminders ofinternal dynamics that have been overlooked and possibly forgotten in contemporaryhistoriography), and Yougoslavia was a living example of what we could call a possibly creativede-alignment throughout the cold war, not to mention Charter 77 and many other non-orthodoxcommunist underground movements in eastern Europe inspired by the Helsinki conference. Yet, byportraying eastern Europe as a single entity, one tends to loose these elements and consider only thecommon exposure to Soviet totalitarianism, which will not do justice to different nationalexperiences and legacies. Paul Blokker’s latest work (see his paper for this Conference) is preciselyabout retrieving the positive impact of central and eastern European political thought on politicaltheory in general deserves particular attention against a reducing view on eastern Europe, whileChristian Domnitz has presented elsewhere a typology of rich discourses about Europe thatemerged in the Ostblock in the period 1970-1990 (Domnitz 2008). This latter work demonstrateshow certain themes of a cultural Europe premised on Christianity or other historical traits have alsoemerged in the shadow of communism and highlight some common ground between East and Westof Europe, far from views depicting Eastern Europe as void of possible contribution to Europe atlarge.3. b) ‘European’ identity and historyThe second problem with a certain idea of ‘Europe’ is related to the question of collectiveidentity (and we will touch here on the necessity of auto-institution on the cognitive levelintroduced in the introduction). As known from social sciences, the question of identity is a veryslippery one for it automatically refers to a political project and/or point of view (Wagner 2005).With regard to collective identity18 one should always consider the relation of a polity to its present,future but also to its past. An integrated Europe in the present form is an agglomerate of 27 memberstates whose future is to aim at integrating into a single market and, possibly, expand to include newmember states in the future. Even if the stress is put on the acquis communautaire (expressedgenerally in legal terms) as a binding common element to the 27 member states, there remains thedividing element of different historical pasts. We could say here that western and eastern Europes(if we take these two realms as cohesive entities for the sake of the intellectual exercise) are in a18 Another quaestio vexata is the difference between individual and collective identity. On this topic, see Winter &Sivan (1999: Intro), Bottici (2009).10situation of allochronism, in the sense that they are not in the same position and situation withregard to their past and do not have the same critical distance to their own history in order toperform the Vergangenheitsbewältigung that any polity has to perform after traumatic experiences.Judt perfectly demonstrates how the end of WW2, Soviet rule and the liberation fromUSSR’s yoke have provoked serious distortions of the past and have made of the past ‘anothercountry’ (Judt 2002). Thus, the imposition of a Soviet totalitarian domination and the destruction ofeastern European’s public spheres, the remoulding of national pasts according to class strugglelines, the many damnationes memoriae and violent purges imposed during forty years, not tomention the problematic return of newly rediscovered heroes resisting Sovietization in the last 15years (ibid.) and the surge of destructive nationalisms since the fall of the wall are all examples thatthe past still weigh heavily on eastern European shoulders. Yet, this weigh is difficult to tackle fornot enough time has passed since. Western Europe, on the other hand, has had more time toconfront its past and reconcile certain divide that traumatic experiences such as WW2 or thepolitical instabilities of the immediate post-war in France, Italy or Germany provoked (yet, this doesnot mean that the Bewältigung has been perfect neither completed).On the question of collective memory and Vergangenheitsbewältigung, the work of StefanTroebst (2005. 2006) is most useful for he points to the fragmented themes of memory acrossEurope. If the Holocaust is a fundamental point for collective western European memory, otherthemes occupy the fore of collective debates in Central and Eastern European countries, changingfrom the trauma of foreign occupations and dismemberment by Nazi and then Soviet troops(Poland, Baltic Countries, e.g.), the Gulag experience, or also the terrible recollection of Holodomor(the 1932-33 famine in parts of the Soviet Union which struck large parts of Ukraine). Troebst iscorrect to state that the 2004 enlargement has revealed the depth of the difference in terms ofcollective memory between East and West Europe.19Henri Rousso’s article on the dilemma of a European identity (2004) is central for ourdiscussion of heterochrony. Rousso indicates first that there seems to be a pattern in whichcollective occultation and recollection of historical traumas follow one another (amnesia,anamnesis, etc.). Second, there are also uncompressible times through which historical memory hasto go through before any given large social group is able to accept a commonly shared interpretationof the collective past: one cannot expect that a society will deal with its past right after the end of atraumatic experience. Judt’s concluding essay ‘From the House of Dead’ of his Postwar (2005)shows the timing and length of occultation of certain debates. To come back to the theme that‘Europe’ is in need of a common memory to reinforce its sense of identity, one should note that if‘Europe’ is about using western European historical experience as a possible foundation for aEuropean identity (as a way to go beyond war between nations, and per antonomase a war betweenFrance and Germany), then this historical experience might not be easily accepted by EasternEuropeans for two reasons. First, because not all Eastern Europeans have the same traumatic past toconfront (Troebst 2006) and because they are in a different phase of their work on memory(Erinnerungsarbeit) since they have just come out the traumatic Soviet domination for forty years.We are now back to the allochronism question. If one sustains that Eastern Europeans aredragging their feet in acknowledging the centrality of the Holocaust for a common Europeanidentity, this is not just putting them in another time (a la Fabian), but it is also forcing onto them acertain theme to confront at the expenses of those considered more urgent by the collective memory19 „Auch der Holocaust-Holodomor-Gedächtnisgraben ist erst im Zuge der EU-Erweiterung sichtbar geworden. UmÜberschwang der Nach-Wende-Zeit waren diese Themen nicht erörtert worden. Die öffentliche Diskussion hat geradeerst begonnen.” (Troebst 2005).11of this region. It is in this condition that an allochronic statement (‘they are dragging their feet..’)becomes an alienating statement leading to a situation of heterochrony, that is a situation ofcognitive heteronomy motivated in terms of different time locations.The literature on Central and Eastern Europe and from Eastern European writers abound ofthe theme of allochronism. The idea of a ‘return’ to Europe implies in an indirect way different timelocations and the necessity of ‘touching base’ with the main time of Europe. Some of CzeslawMilosz’s writings about his experience as a Pole in western Europe is tainted of connotation ofbackwardness and how this self-perception has affected him and co-nationals.20 Note thatallochronism is by no means a feature of western Europeans, but also by eastern Europeansthemselves21. Barbra Törnquist-Plewa notes that “Polish ‘Euro-enthusiasts’ who advocate a speedyintegration into the EU are deeply critical of Polish society and accuse it of being conservative,limited, fanatically religious, nationalistic, burdened with the heritage of the past and immature.”(Törnquist-Plewa 2002: 237). The fact that allochronic trope can at times become heterochrony isexemplified in the following quote of Janis Peters, Chairman of the Writers’ Union of the LatvianRepublic and Latvian writer answering a comment in 1989 about Russians: “The proposition thatthe Russians are worse off is no consolation for the Latvians, Lithuanians and Estonians, or a reasonfor waiting for a deteriorating situation also in the Baltic area. Why compare us with less developedregions? Compare us instead with Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark” (quoted in Karlsson2002: 182). Here clearly the writer expresses the view that the Baltic countries resent being ascribedto a backward situation and would prefer to choose to be compared and be part of the moreadvanced Scandinavian club.Heterochrony is therefore a serious hurdle in the ideational convergence of self-perceptionsas ‘Europeans’ by Eastern Europeans. This impression for Central and East Europe that a certainpast and certain type of Erinnerungsarbeit that provide significance mostly to western Europeansare leading Eastern Europeans to a certain form of resentment towards ‘Europe’.22 Törnquist-Plewastresses in the Polish case that “identification with Europe is made difficult by the fact that Poles donot feel accepted by those they want to identify with” (Törnquist-Plewa 2002: 239). This problemcan hardly be written off for large parts of Eastern Europe which has suffered from external power(Fremdherrschaft) and it is extremely important to acknowledge this problem. So, while Troebst isright in pointing to a variety of traumas that Europeans have to confront, one should also think ofthe timing of trauma elaboration and Erinnerungsarbeit. One cannot therefore expect, e.g.,Estonians to recognize the centrality of Holocaust for a European memory, when it is still facingburning questions about the past of Soviet occupation and Russification policies (Kattago 2008a)and has become (again) independent ‘not even’ twenty years ago. Any society should thereforehave the right, on a cognitive level, to say: “Holocaust, or Holodomor, is not the central worry forus now” and assert its own priority in terms of collective memory, if such statements areaccompanied by a corollary moral obligation to acknowledge the suffering of others. If not, there isan imposition from outside23 of a given memory agenda that prevents full autonomy for thatsociety. As put by the Estonian scholar Siobhan Kattago (2008b), there should be, between easternand western Europe an ‘agreement to disagree’ on memory and cultural identity.20 See some quotes in Törnquist-Plewa (2002: 232ff)21 This echoes the existence of oriental ‘Orientalists’ (a la Said) described in the contect of the Middle East by Sadiki(2004: 180ff). Note that these oriental orientalists or in our case Eastern European allochronists are an indirect witnessof a profound asymmetrical relations between two polities.22 Similarly, in Turkey, many people are becoming increasingly Euro-skeptic in part for the reasons stated here.23 This is not to say that foreigners should have no say in the public debates about collective history and memory ofanother country. At times it can be salutary, if one think of the role of Paxton for France to eventually confront itsVichy past.123. c) Europe as a western European experienceThe third and final problem with a certain projection about the integration of Europe on liesin forcing the possibility of a common fate (Schicksalsgemeinschaft) for the whole of Europe. If thisis done too rigidly, and by not taking into consideration the fact that by ‘European’ experience wespeak in reality of western Europe’s historical experience, then it will be difficult for EasternEuropeans to accept a new imposition of a hegemonic past (Judt 2002). Indeed, there are somebiases on the history of European integration that are the result of the context of the nascent ColdWar which witnessed the birth of the first European institutions that still loom over certain debatesand themes. Looking at the history of European integration through the prism of the Cold War, asdone by Messenger (2006) is a good reminder (against the euphoria of federalist historiography24)of the serious security considerations at stake in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the time where thefirst European communities were founded. What such history does not tell us really is that thecontext of Cold War served also an ‘imaginary war’, to take the phrase of Kaldor (1990) where theenemy was not so much the external ‘other’ (eastern European communism, or Stalinism as it wasfrequently described) but the internal ‘other’, namely the opposition of the western Europeancommunists in western Europe (or the red threat in the USA of the McCarthy era). The consequenceof this was that for a few decades the discourse of the threat of the Soviets and of Stalinism (whichwas tied to the first years of the European communities) served the purpose of taming part of thepolitical forces in the Europe of the Six (communist parties and trade unions in particular),undermining thus the possibility of representing the construction of a new Europe as a politicalproject of all its citizens, and even in some cases alienating some segments of the population fromsupporting the European cause.25 So one consequence of the brandishing of external other’s threatfor ‘Europe’ with a view on internal affairs was that it turned effectively this external other into aforgotten other of Europe, in the sense that it reinforced the view that Eastern Europe was totallyequated with threat and no other potential constitutive elements.In a parallel way, and to come back to current times, one could say that a political Europeought to be careful when representing itself as a positive project offering equal opportunity for all inits drive to open up new horizons for eastern Europeans and integrate into (western) Europe. Afterall, there is a sense of a Europe with two speeds, on the one hand, one within the Euro-zone and (atleast until to the first days of 2008) with a differentiated access to mobility (with the Schengen area)and a reality of a prosperous western Europe and, on the other hand, still devastated socio-economiclandscapes of the former eastern block. The contrast between the ‘old’ and ‘new’ Länder inGermany is a cruel reminder of this two-speed Europe. So to take up again the image of the ColdWar, it is one thing to remind us of the historical origins of ‘Europe’, but another are the long-lasting consequences of the Cold War: to a certain degree, European integration of eastern Europehas overlapped with the military expansion of NATO, the history of ‘Europe’ is mostly that of awestern Christian (be it Catholic or Protestant) Europe (at the expenses of an Orthodox and alsofrom a Muslim Europe). Current debates about civil society, economic development, or standards ofliving still echo some of the debates of the 1950s about democracy and development (thinking backon Lipset’s Political Man (1960), or his ‘Requisites to Democracy’ (1959), or Rostow’s Non-communist Manifesto (1960), etc.). The Cold War might be over in facts, but ‘Europe’ might stillcarry along some of its scoria (Laqueur’s Last days of Europe: Epitaph for an old continent oughtto be read critically in this light, I think). It would instead be interesting to explore, in the line ofDomnitz (2008), another type of historiography that looks at the point of view of the ‘other’, in thiscase Eastern European themselves, that considers dissident intra-east European points of view bothof the past and current times, or that sheds new lights on the continuing tensions within Eastern24 See Dinand (2006) and also Kaiser (2006).25 It is interesting to see how communist parties of western Europe have changed their position on Europe from the1960s onwards, gradually becoming less anti-Europeanist to declared pro-Europeanists for most of them nowadays.13European societies after the 2004 enlargement. The best example consists of the puzzle of violentriots in Hungary to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 1956 stand off, a proof of a continuingmalaise despite a ‘successful’ transition, while the conflict over the Soviet War Memorial in Tallinnillustrates the need for non-hegemonic interpretations of the past in post-national polities (Kattago2008a).4. A final word: The Other of Europe and HeterochronyThis paper is a call to consider eastern Europe not simply as the void ‘other’ of (western)Europe by 1989 and to a-void western-euro-centrism at large when looking at European integrationand 1989. Indeed when the presence of external ‘others’ loom over certain political debates or serveas a marker of differentiation between large social groups, this is often done at the expenses of asound discussion of each other’s points of view and all too often serve only emotional purposes(one of which can be a repli identitaire fed by collective resentment) and lead to essentalisationsboth of the internal content of what ‘Europe’ is about (in terms of borders, culture, identity, ormemory), and about its ‘others’—past and present ones.26Since Eastern Europe is the geographical space from which the ‘other’ of Stalinism andcommunism threatened the Europe of the Six in the 1950s, one should examine the relationsbetween a political Europe and Eastern Europe also in this light and with great attention. SurelyEastern Europe no longer represents such an ‘other’ for a political Europe, but lasting imprints ofthe cold war period and mental maps (as shown in Ill. 2 and its contemporary version in Ill. 1)might render this work difficult. Now that ‘Europe’ is made of 27 member states, surely the centreof gravity of a common political Europe has moved eastwards, a fact that one could clearly perceivein the latest round of harsh negotiations (especially from Poland who tries to maximize its fullmembership into the EU and does not hesitate to behave, at times, in an arrogant manner since it isnow part of the club) around the Treaty of Lisbon signed in December 2007. Yet, when it comes towriting the history of Europe or the description of ‘Europe’ as a cultural entity, the centre of gravityprobably still has to be re-adjusted accordingly, giving more voice and space to eastern Europeanexperiences and projects. If not, one risks creating artificial binaries rendering ideationalconvergence around the EU impossible.Such binary divides can also be found in the self-reflective dimensions of Europe when acertain type of occidentalist literature contributes to otherize through a variety of means and tropesabout Central and Eastern European societies. One dimension of this contemporary ‘otherization’process that we have discussed in this paper and which is, in our view, understudied, is the questionof allochronism and this tendency to ascribe groups to different time locations. We have argued thatthe capacity of auto-institution on the cognitive level is as important for the viability of theEuropean project as structural convergence around the EU has been and is for the 12 new memberstates. This capacity of auto-institution for Eastern European societies is currently most vividlynecessary on the field of Erinnerungsarbeit, Vergangenheitsbewältigung and collective memoryaround the question of a ‘cultural Europe’. If not Eastern European societies feel that they are26 For some preliminary conclusion on the study of Islam and Turkey as the ‘other’ of Europe, see Challand (2008). Fora plea to be more inclusive about the nature and content of ‘Europe’ see Shore ( 2000: 63):“[…] Creating the ‘European identity’, as depicted in EU discourse, entails a degree of exclusion of the Other. […]‘European identity tends to become meaningful only when contrasted to that which is not Europe. As Europeconsolidates and converges, and as the barriers between European nation-states are eliminated, so the boundariesseparating Europe from its Third World ‘Others’ have intensified. […] The problem with this approach to identity is itsabsolutism: its failure to recognise cultures as composite and hybrid entities.”14placed in a situation of heterochrony, this condition might lead to more than ‘mere’ ideationaldivergence, but possibly outright political standoff between different parties. Without referring tothe question of heterochrony, the situation that Troebst describes about the impasse around thecreation of a European Network of Memory and Solidarity (Troebst 2007) between Germany andPoland is, in part, close to one of heterochrony and where the current situation is an effective end totransnational collaboration. Difficult in these circumstances to envisage further ‘integration’ andlarger debates about Europe as a cultural project. Going back to a better understanding of 1989might instead lay the path of a richer and more diverse understanding of what constitutes Europe,East and West.15Bibliographical references<ref>Aldrich R.
