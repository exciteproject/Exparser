Time studies in psychology or in consumer behaviour,traditionally think of the personal future as a Lewinian ‘life space’,containing several well-known time dimensions: future time per-spective, future anxiety, and hope. Those dimensions are used to testthe predictive power of various behaviours (attitudinal change,health behaviour, delay of gratification, etc.) or more specifically:the temporality of consumer behaviours as implied in consumptionof cultural goods, exploratory consumer behaviour, or mail orderpurchasing. However, the personal future is flexible enough toenable individuals to project themselves well beyond this ‘life space’into a post-mortem future. In this context, I propose to look at theconcept of death anxiety. Researchers studying the influence of timerepresentations on human behaviour should not limit themselves toapprehending the traditional dimension of personal future; theycould integrate an understanding of the future that projects us beyondphysical death. This requires first a close examination of the rela-tionships between death anxiety and the traditionally applied futuredimensions, and then broadening the scope to various human andconsumer behaviours still unexplained by traditionally acknowl-edged temporal dimensions. I first present the classical Lewiniannotion of personal future, highlighting some of its aspects, to showhow death anxiety is part of the personal future, and presents majorbehavioural impacts. Second, by using structural equation model-ling, and a multi-group approach, I present an empirical study aimingto show the nature and the intensity of the links between deathanxiety and the other traditionally applied dimensions.

The aim of this article is to integrate death anticipation inthe conceptual structure of our time experience. Close relations between deathand time have already been demonstrated. For example, Held and Nützinger(1998) and Sabelis (2002) discuss the dominance of ‘clock time’ as the ultimatemode for conjuration of finitude. However, if we want to expand our scopebeyond relations with ‘clock time’, we should envisage death with other formsof time experience, also qualified by perception, perspective or temporalorientation.1 Very early, the French philosopher Guyau (1890) considered timeas a product of the consciousness and wrote that the past and the future arerepresented. In keeping with the tradition of Lewin (1942), psychologists andsocial psychologists such as Fraisse (1967), Nuttin (1980), Raynor and Entin(1982), have contributed considerably to the structuring and the knowledge inthis field of research. Moreover, among the three temporal zones, the future hasbeen the object of specific research (Bouffard, 1993; Zaleski, 1996, 2005), asmuch as on the means of apprehending and living it cognitively and emotionallyas on its behavioural impact (Strathman and Joireman, 2005). But what futureare we discussing? Since the works of Lewin (1942), most works traditionallythink of the personal future as a Lewinian ‘life space’ (Bergadaà, 1990;Strathman and Joireman 2005). In psychology for example, this ‘life space’ con-tains several well-known dimensions that are used to test the predictive power ofvarious behaviours (attitude change, health behaviour, delay of gratification,etc.). In marketing and consumer behaviour, other behaviours are tested(consumption of cultural goods, exploratory consumer behaviour, mail orderpurchasing, etc.). Yet, Boyd and Zimbardo (1997) strayed onto another path byintegrating what happens in the afterlife into their reflection about time. Adamand Groves (2007) outline the importance of the encounters with death to ‘tamethe future’. Finally, Routledge and Arndt (2005: 59) add that, ‘Being able tothink about the future means being able to think about a future without us in it.’In keeping with the works of these authors, this article proposes to integratedeath anticipation, and more specifically death anxiety, into the structure ofone’s personal future. On the individual level, this new integration requests firsta close examination of the relationships between death anxiety and the tradi-tional dimensions of the future, and should then broaden the scope of under-standing of various human and consumer behaviours still unexplained bytraditional temporal dimensions. If the behavioural impact of death anxiety hasalready been studied both in psychology (Tomer and Eliason, 1996) and con-sumer behaviour (Bonsu and Belk, 2003; Urien, 2003), there rarely have beenURIEN: SELFLESS TIME369works addressing the topic in terms of time studies. Yet, it is important thatresearchers studying the influence of time representations on human behaviour,and consumer behaviour, should not limit themselves to apprehending thetraditional dimensions of the personal future but integrate also the future whichprojects us beyond our physical death.This research firstly presents the classical Lewinian notion of personal future,highlights some of its aspects, shows how death anxiety is part of the personalfuture, and presents some of the major behavioural impacts. Second, by usingstructural equation modelling, and a multi-group approach, we present anempirical study aiming to show the nature and the intensity of the links betweendeath anxiety and other dimensions of temporal orientation.Death Anxiety: Personal Future and Selfless Anticipation‘Man is the only animal aware of his own mortality. Without the awareness ofone’s own finiteness, there can be no consciousness of one’s past – no remorse,nor nostalgia – and no consciousness of one’s future – in other words, noconsciousness of time’ (Piettre, 1994: 117, author’s translation). Paul Fraisse, aneminent psychologist of time, wrote that philosophical reflection had precededscientific reflection on a number of issues, and that this process was certainlystill underway. After presenting the work of several philosophers on the linksbetween death awareness and the representation of time, I will argue how deathanxiety can be integrated into the network of the personal future.Death awareness and personal futureThe subjective experience of time and, more specifically, the representationhumankind has constructed of time, has been one of philosophy’s favouritetopics. Nonetheless, the variety of ways in which philosophy grasps time shouldprompt us to caution. It led Pélicier (cited in Sutter, 1983) to write that allphilosophers have dealt with time without giving any definite answers, sincenone of them talk about the same thing. He continues by stating that they areonly philosophers in one particular moment and grasp time on the basis of theirown personal issues that depend on their own life stories and status. Whiletime is thought of as a ‘dilation of the soul’ by St Augustine or as an ‘intimateconsciousness’ by Husserl, it is a space of possibilities and action projects forHeidegger (1927/1986). According to Heidegger, ‘authentic’ time is the open-ended time of projects; it is the characteristic of human reality to be projectedbefore one’s own situation. Our relation to time is determined by the tragic fateof our personal future and the awareness that our future’s limitation, that is, ofthe more or less 700,000 hours theoretically at our disposal. ‘Authentic time’ is370TIME & SOCIETY 16(2/3)not constructed by the individual alone but is rather the result of his/her aware-ness of his/her own death: human existence is finite and it is precisely the‘anticipation of one’s own finiteness’, the co-presence of death – source ofexistential anxiety – that reveals the future, a temporal perspective full of possi-bilities and plans. French philosopher Marcel Conche (1980: 71) wrote: ‘Deathis my fate. So be it. I anticipate it. I refuse to wait until time passes and let thefuture come to me. I anticipate the future; I decide what it will be; I determine it’(author’s translation). Confronted with the ‘destined power’ of time, severalreactions are possible. Conche suggests that there are several types of illusionsthat make it possible to forget about one’s mortality: the ‘religious illusion’opens up the hope of life after death; the ‘moral illusion’ awards hope ofeternity on the basis of merit; the ‘social illusion’ works, thanks to prestige,fame, consideration and glory; the ‘ontological illusion’ relies on possessionsand the ‘apparent consistency of reality’ (author’s translation); finally, with the‘practical illusion’, oblivion is granted, thanks to action: by focusing on my task,action makes me forget my own mortality. Thus, from a metaphysical point ofview, death awareness is not only a cornerstone of our awareness of time, but italso generates behaviours aiming at supporting or abolishing finiteness.Personal future: From life space to death anxietyEver since Lewin, the personal future is considered as a possible extension ofone’s life space. Lewin writes that life space is extended during what he calls‘the psychological time dimension’. The psychological time dimension of one’slife space increases from hours, days and months up to years. In other words,young children live in the immediate present. As they age, an evermore distantpsychological past and future affects their present behaviours. Psychologists oftime, such as Fraisse (1967), Nuttin (1980), Bouffard (1993), Zaleski (1997,2005) have followed this approach and have shown how several differentdimensions of one’s personal future may affect one’s behaviour. Nuttin evenwent so far as to create a theory of human motivation based on the notion ofpersonal future. He considers that the future is a pivotal life space, as opposed tothe present and the past, which are of lesser importance. Several dimensionsstructure our future. Among these dimensions, the best-known are the futuretime perspective (FTP), the consideration of future consequence, anxiety, hopeand future-orientation. The future time perspective represents all the goals of anindividual, that is, ‘all future mental representations associated with an affect’(Bouffard, 1993, author’s translation). There are two components in the FTP: acognitive component and an affective component. The cognitive component ofthe FTP is made up of ‘goal objects’ (Nuttin, 1980), which are more or lessdistant from the present. According to Lens (1993), someone whose goals aremainly located in the immediate future has a limited FTP, whereas someoneURIEN: SELFLESS TIME371whose goals extend to a distant future has an extended FTP. Moreover,Strathman et al. (1994) developed a new dimension, the consideration of futureconsequences (CFC), which deals with ‘the extent to which individuals thinkabout the relatively immediate versus distant consequences of their potentialactions’. As for the affective dimension of the FTP, it corresponds to one’saffective attitude towards the future, which in turn consists of both a positive anda negative side. The manifestations of the positive side are optimism and hope.Thus, according to Zaleski (1993), the future, when considered as an environ-ment conducive to making plans and reaching one’s goals, usually takes on apositive motivational dimension in that it prompts one to constructive action andto maintaining it. Snyder (1991) and Snyder et al. (1996) is unquestionably oneof the specialists in the field of hope. The negative affective attitude has beenconsidered from the angle of anxiety with regard to the future. Zaleski (1997)defines it as a state of anxiety, uncertainty, fear, or concern caused by unfavour-able changes that could occur in one’s distant personal future. Predominanttemporal orientation is yet another important factor. According to the definitiongiven by Nuttin (1980), this temporal orientation is the preferential or predomi-nant orientation of an individual towards one of the three temporal directions:past, present or future. Thus, if an individual’s centre of interests, concerns orconversations pertain to the future, he is then said to be future-oriented.If temporal orientation, in its broader sense, is one of the most fundamentalaspects of humanity, most of the publications devoted to it consider the future asa Lewinian life space and do not take into account events that may occur afterthis life space. Yet for Boyd and Zimbardo (1997) the future can be partitionedinto pre- and post-death time frames. While the traditional psychological and‘mundane’ future begins in the present and extends to physical death, thisnew notion of a transcendental future starts with physical death and goes on toinfinity. The transcendental future perspective may contain goals such as beingreunited with deceased loved ones, eternal life, reincarnation, etc. Accordingto the authors, the transcendental future perspective is a personality trait withindividual differences; it also influences our present behaviour.The main contribution of Boyd and Zimbardo (1997) has been to free thefuture perspective from the physical limit imposed by death. Nevertheless, it isimportant to underline that they insist on cognitive components of the transcen-dental future perspective that are generally positive (being reunited withdeceased relatives, etc.). Just like the classical future perspective has affectivedimensions, be they negative (anxiety towards the future) or positive (hope,optimism), the transcendental future perspective must have an affective compo-nent to deal with the anticipation of the absence of one’s self. The presentarticle insists on the negative affective component, that is, death anxiety. Deathanxiety is rarely dealt with from the point of view of time, and yet it belongs tothe network of the personal future (pre- and post-death). Furthermore, this kind372TIME & SOCIETY 16(2/3)of ‘selfless time’ has been the topic of important studies dealing with its contentand influence on behaviour.Death anxiety: A definitionSince the seminal work of Feifel (1955), more than 1,000 papers have dealt withdeath anxiety, its definition, its causes and its behavioural consequences. Fewauthors, among them Dickstein (1975), Neimeyer (1994), have ventured todefine the concept. On the basis of these various definitions, I will first give myown definition of death anxiety and then outline its main characteristics. I definedeath anxiety as a set of negative emotional reactions of variable intensityinduced by selfless anticipation (Urien, 2003). While many authors qualifydeath anxiety as an emotional reaction, Neimeyer (1994) is more precise and,under the generic name of death anxiety, includes ‘a set of attitudes character-ized by fear, threat, anxiety, illness, discomfort, or any other similar negativefeeling’. Furthermore, recent attempts at defining death anxiety speak about ‘astate during which the self does not exist’ (Tomer and Eliason, 1996). In the con-text of time, we will speak about selfless anticipation. Nevertheless, whereasearly work presented death anxiety as a one-dimensional construct only(Templer, 1970), at the present time some authors wish to differentiate severalsub-dimensions of anxiety, such as the anxiety regarding one’s physical stateafter death, one’s destruction, or the loss of one’s social identity. In actual fact,according to Neimeyer (1994), it seems that there exists a general anxietytowards the disappearance of one’s self. This general anxiety can then be sub-divided according to the kind of thought – pertaining to death – that causesanxiety (physical destruction, loss of one’s soul, loss of one’s identity, etc.)(Urien, 2003).Selfless Time, Death Anxiety and Behavioural AdaptationRegarding behavioural reactions, various theories have shown that individualsdevelop different means of self-preservation. These means can be direct and/orindirect, and take the form of physiological necessities and symbols respect-ively. Theorists of death anxiety have only focused on symbolic forms in theirinvestigations. In this respect, two major consequences have appeared: the firstwas developed in a pioneering theory, the Terror Management Theory (TMT)(Solomon et al., 1991), which deals with faith in a cultural world-view and self-esteem, whereas the second deals with generativity and ‘outliving the self’(Kotre, 1984).URIEN: SELFLESS TIME373Selfless anticipation and terror managementFirst identified by Jeff Greenberg, Tom Pyszczynski and Sheldon Solomon(Greenberg et al., 1990), TMT has been the subject of more than 200 empiricalstudies. It states that death anxiety is the emotional manifestation of the funda-mental instinct of self-preservation. Preservation of the self may be fulfilledthrough direct means (e.g. remaining healthy, avoiding bad food), but also, moreimportantly, through symbolic means related to the individual’s culture. Tobe more precise, there are two symbolic and closely linked self-preservationmechanisms: (1) unfailing support of world-views and the values of one’sculture, and (2) increase in self-esteem – a goal that may be reached by adoptingculturally valued behaviours. Concerning adaptation based on faith in a culturalworld-view, the theory states that we construct a culture and take part in it so asto minimize the concern associated with death or the loss of self. While culturecan offer immortality through religion, it also contributes to creating a culturalframework or ‘world-view’ composed of values clearly identifiable by indi-viduals. As for adaptation grounded on self-esteem, the more an individualsubscribes to and respects the values of his/her culture, the more his/her self-esteem increases and the less anxious he/she feels about his/her own death.Experimental studies have shown that behavioural adaptation, for example,could lead to: (1) risky behaviour (Orit Taubman Ben-Ari, 2000), (2) conspicu-ous consumption and greed, (3) pro-social behaviours, (4) a decrease in high-calorie fatty food intake that has a negative impact on both the body andself-image (Ferraro et al., 2005).When selfless anticipation ‘outlives the self’: GenerativityWhile, for Thomas (1995), ‘generativity answers the human quest for immortal-ity’, Kotre (1984) considers it to be a kind of ‘outliving of the self’. Afterpresenting the concept of generativity, this part will highlight one of its possiblemanifestations, that is, ‘time capsules’.The concept of generativity was first introduced by Erik Erikson (1963) over40 years ago. ‘Generativity versus stagnation’ is the seventh of the eight stagesin Erikson’s human life cycle theory. It is first associated with the middle adultyears. Bearing and raising children are the first experiences of generativity.However, a broader definition of this concept includes different life settings,such as ‘professional activities, volunteer endeavours, participation in religiousand political organizations, neighbourhood and community activism, friendshipand even leisure time pursuits’ (McAdams and de St. Aubin, 1998). McAdamsand de St. Aubin (1998) suggested a typology of generativity that includesdifferent generative behaviours (McAdams and de St. Aubin, 1992): creating,maintaining and offering one’s self. By ‘creating’, the authors mean a generative374TIME & SOCIETY 16(2/3)behaviour towards things and people, figuratively and literally giving birth toboth (McAdams et al., 1998). It involves ‘the creation of a product or legacy inone’s own image . . . a powerful extension of the self (idem)’ (McAdams et al.,1998: 23) as well. ‘Maintaining’ is another kind of generative behaviour. Itconsists of the conservation or the preservation behaviours that are valued.McAdams et al. (1998) mention behaviours such as preserving good traditions.‘Offering’ corresponds to the offering or the gifts of things that have previouslybeen created and maintained, or the handing down of something or someoneto the next generation. This can be understood as a way of extending one’sexistence beyond physical death to reach symbolic immortality. According toMcAdams et al. (1998), ‘generativity is tied up with a society’s overall concep-tion of time’. If we are talking about creating new things or human beings thatwill outlive the self, generativity then deals with the long-term future.Maintaining, preserving and passing on goods and traditions point to the past.Therefore, by creating a link between different generations, generativity bridgesthe past and the future. Generativity could induce such behaviours as ecologi-cally friendly behaviour (Urien and Kilbourne, 2007).An illustration and manifestation of the concept of generativity is thephenomenon of ‘time capsules’. A time capsule contains goods and/or informa-tion that are representative of life at a given point in time, and which couldbe used as a means of communication with people in the future. The commoncharacteristic of all existing time capsules is probably the need to transcend theend of one’s personal future by means of a gift that reflects a given period oftime, the need to preserve it and to pass it on to future generations.I have previously discussed how temporal orientation, and more specificallythe personal future, has been considered and dimensioned almost exclusively asa ‘life space’. Yet philosophically and psychologically, certain authors showthat the representation of the future cannot be envisaged without integrating theanticipation of self-absence: death. I have insisted here on the affective dimen-sion linked to this anticipation: death anxiety. Its main behavioural influenceshave also been introduced. In part two, I aim to examine in depth the relationsbetween death anxiety and certain traditional dimensions of the future. If deathanxiety belongs to the structure of the personal future, what are the links and theintensity of these links with the traditional dimensions of temporal orientationand those of the personal future in particular? Is future anxiety linked to deathanxiety? Do individuals orientated towards the future have the same intensity ofdeath anxiety as individuals orientated towards the past or the present? These arethe questions that the following empirical study will attempt to address.URIEN: SELFLESS TIMEResearch examples375Few studies deal with the links between different temporal dimensions and deathanxiety. Bascue et al. (1977) have shown, for example, that based on a sampleof 88 77-year-old Americans, death anxiety is associated with an orientationtowards the future (Bascue et al., 1977). Dickstein (1975), based on a sample of185 American students and using Thematic Aperception Test (TAT) tests tomeasure temporal orientation, has shown a link between orientation towards thepast and death anxiety. However, no links were found with an orientationtowards the future. What then are the links with other temporal dimensions? Onother groups? On different age categories? On different cultures? By using othermethodological tools?This study will contribute to answering these questions by studying morespecifically the links that exist between death anxiety, future anxiety and pre-dominant orientation towards the future. In contrast with these dimensionslinked to the future, the study of links with an orientation towards the past andthe present will also be integrated. Each construct has been operationalizedby an indicator of measure and I have used so-called ‘second-generation’ pro-cessing methods. After validating the different measurement models corre-sponding to the indicators retained, we will then be able to envisage the linksexisting between the different latent factors.Operationalization of the Constructs and Presenting the ScalesThe indicators retained to measure death anxiety, predominant temporal orien-tation towards the future, the past and the present, and, finally, future anxiety,are introduced successively.A measure of death anxietyThe construction of scales to measure this construct has been particularlydeveloped in recent years due to an interest in a better understanding of theindividual differences regarding death anxiety, their origins and their conse-quences. Robert Neimeyer, of the University of Memphis, is currently thespecialist in this area. Although numerous indicators can be noted at the presenttime (for a summary, see Neimeyer 1994, 1997–8), the author, however, high-lights two important problems: discordant definitions of the concept and a lackof a theoretical base, to the point that St-Amour and Kiely (2000) ask if thefunction of the death anxiety scale is to define the concept. From the middle ofthe 1950s until the end of the 1970s, indirect tests with a projective tendencywere used. Among these tests I note, for example, the 10 ‘TAT’ drawings that376TIME & SOCIETY 16(2/3)refer to death (Epley and Rick, 1963, cited in Dickstein, 1975). However, thecreation and the use of these tools rapidly declined, notably due to the cumber-someness of an important manipulation, a lack of validity and reliability, and thearrival of much more practical attitude scales that made it possible to directlyapprehend death anxiety. In fact, 95 percent of the studies published in psy-chology on this topic use these types of test (Neimeyer, 1997–8). Among thebetter known, we cite Templer’s (1970) ‘Death Anxiety Scale (D.A.S)’, Colettand Lester’s (1969) the ‘Fear of Death Scale (F.D.S)’, Neimeyer’s (1994)‘Threat Index (T.I)’ and Dickstein’s (1975) ‘Death Concern Scale (D.C.S)’.Moreover, the last scale is composed of 30 items and 2 dimensions: one dimen-sion representing the conscious meditation of death, and a second dimensionrepresenting a negative evaluation of it. However, only the second factor is con-sidered as specifically characterizing death anxiety. The other dimension doesnot correspond to negative emotional reaction towards death but to the con-sciousness of it. In addition, a more recent analysis (Klug and Boss, 1976) showsthat the factor relative to death anxiety is only composed of five items. I can alsoadd here that this factor is apprehended in a general, undifferentiated manner.Furthermore, this scale is the only one that has been validated to date in a Frenchcontext (Urien, 2001).Measures of predominant temporal orientation and future anxietyI have chosen Usunier and Valette-Florence’s ‘Times Styles Scale’ (1994) inorder to measure temporal orientation. It should be noted here that in its com-plete version, this scale measures 4 dimensions and 8 sub-dimensions in 29items. I have kept the dimensions that seem pertinent for this study, that is, thepredominant temporal orientation towards the past and the predominant orienta-tion towards the future. This scale offers very good psychometric qualities andhas often been used (partially or completely) on various and numerous popula-tions and in different cultural contexts (Valette-Florence et al., 2001), resultingin many relatively recent publications (for a summary, see Usunier and Valette-Florence in this issue).This scale does not take into account present-orientation. I have used one ofthe dimensions of the temporal orientations scale developed by Ko and Gentry(1991), and by Gentry (1993) for this specific dimension. The reliability of themeasure of this dimension is adequate (α = 0.74). The authors have attempted totest the intercultural validity of these scales on two samples (American andThai students) and to explore the sub-dimensions. However, only the present-orientation appeared to resist an invariance of factors.Concerning future anxiety, we have used Zaleski’s scale (1996). This one-dimensional scale, tested and validated on several American and Polish samples,has good psychometric qualities. It is composed of 29 items in all, 4 of which areURIEN: SELFLESS TIME377‘buffers’. Moreover, in order to check the global convergent validity of the scalein relation to other ones that are conceptually close, the author correlated thePolish version of this scale with other anxiety scales. The coefficients obtainedshow that this type of anxiety is close to traditional conceptions of anxiety, be itCattell’s (1966) ‘Overt-Covert Anxiety’ (r = 0.48, N = 88), Taylor’s (1953)‘Manifest Anxiety’ (r = 0.64, N= 83) or Spielberger ’s (1971) ‘Trait Anxiety’(r = 0.61, N = 135). In fact, if all of these results show that all of these scalesbelong to the same network of the conceptual sphere of anxiety, the scale offuture anxiety, however, conserves its own specificity and its own discriminat-ing utility. Finally, this scale shows encouraging psychometric qualities as wellas a cross-cultural method central to the process of creating a scale.Validation of the scales usedI have worked from two samples of individuals of French origin: one sample of349 young adults (average age: 21) and a sample of 302 older adults (averageage: 47). Six hundred and fifty-one questionnaires were then used for the dataanalysis. According to the works of Gesser et al. (1987), the individuals in their40s would have a higher death anxiety than the individuals belonging to otherage groups. In fact, these two samples have multiple interests: they allow us tohave differences in mean age that are important enough to detect a potentialvariation in the intensity of the level of death anxiety whatever the meaning ofthis variation. It also makes it possible to analyse the stability of relationsbetween death anxiety and the different traditional temporal dimensions.Considering the size of our samples and the nature of our variables, I haveretained more specifically the method of estimation according to the maximumlikelihood. Concerning the translation of the scales into French, I have used thetechnique of blind parallel translation: each of the three translators involveddid his own translation from the source language to the target language inde-pendently, then the different versions were compared and a final version wasmade.Test of the short form scale of death anxietyAs recommended by Klug and Boss (1976), the texts were administered to thetwo samples in its original version. An exploratory factorial analysis then madeit possible to keep items whose ‘loadings’ were superior to 0.50 on one factorand weak on the other factor. My analysis was based uniquely on the dimensionconcerning death anxiety. This analysis permitted me to find again the five itemsthat specifically measure death anxiety. A confirmatory analysis to one latentfactor and five variables of measure was then realized. Validation of themeasures was done based on the confirmatory analyses. The adequacy of the378TIME & SOCIETY 16(2/3)final specified model of measure with the data is satisfactory on the two samples(comparative fit index [CFI*] of 0.99/0.98). The reliability tests give satis-factory results. Indeed, the calculation of Joreskog’s ρ gives a result of 0.88 forthe young adults and 0.82 for the older adults. In order to be certain of the con-vergent validity, I retained only three indictors: a significant link between thevariables of measure and their latent factor, satisfactory criteria of adjustmentand, finally, factorial weights > 0.5. Since all of the criteria have been observed,we can then conclude that the reliability is good and that the validity of the scaleis satisfactory for the two samples.Test of the future anxiety scaleThe exploratory factorial analysis done on the 25 statements showed theexistence of a main factor on the two samples. I therefore retained the firstcomponent and specified a model of measure to one factor. In the end, I obtaineda one-dimensional structure and 13 variables from the 2 samples. Thesevariables have a significant liaison with their latent factor. The adequacy of thespecified models of measure with the data is very satisfactory (CFI* of0.98/0.96). The coefficients of reliability are good (Joreskog’s ρ is 0.90 for theyoung adults and 0.92 for the older adults). The Z tests are all significant andthe supplementary guarantee of convergent validity are given by satisfactorycriteria of adjustment and factorial weights all superior to 0.5.Tests of future-orientation, past-orientation and present-orientation scalesAfter a confirmatory analysis of the items corresponding to predominanttemporal orientations, we obtain the two dimensions corresponding to future-orientation and past-orientation on the two samples. The coefficients of reli-ability are good (ρ of 0.78 and 0.77 for orientation towards the past, and 0.78and 0.67 for orientation towards the future). With a CFI of 0.95 and 0.97, thetwo specified models have a good quality of adjustment. All of the Z tests aresignificant, and all of the statements have a factorial weight > 0.5, which attestto the convergent validity.Regarding orientation towards the present, a confirmatory analysis with alatent factor and 6 variables of measure has been done. An in-depth reading ofthe different variables shows that they express an active search for pleasure veryclose to hedonism. The quality of the fit index are excellent for both the samplesof young adults and older adults. The indices of reliability are good (Joreskog’sρ: 0.86/0.85) and the convergent validity is satisfactory. The quality of theindicators of adjustment and the fact that all of the statements except one have afactorial weight > 0.5 are additional guarantees of convergent validity.Moreover, the correlation analysis between the different latent factors corre-URIEN: SELFLESS TIME379TABLE 1Correlations between death anxiety and future anxiety, future-orientation,past-orientation and present-orientationDeath anxietyYoung adults(average age: 21 years)Older adults(average age: 47 years)Future anxietyFuture-orientationPast-orientationPresent-orientationNote: All of the Z tests are significant, p = 5%0.410.170.31–0.100.430.200.35–0.12sponding to each of the traditional temporal dimensions mobilized shows thattheir discriminating validity is established.Analysis of the links between the traditional temporal dimensions anddeath anxietyAfter having examined the psychometric quality of each scale, we can nowenvisage a correlational analysis between the different latent factors. Havingtwo samples makes it possible to observe the stability of the coefficientsobtained. Concerning the quality of the model and considering the lack ofnormality of the data distribution, the robust fit index has been retained. Thevalue of the CFI (0.91), of the incremental fit index (IFI) (0.91) and the rootmean square error of approximation (RMSEA) (0.053) permits us to maintainthat our models possess a satisfactory quality of adjustment.The analysis of the results shows that death anxiety is positively and signifi-cantly correlated to future anxiety, orientation towards the past and orientationtowards the future. On the other hand, the correlation coefficient is negative butsignificant with orientation towards the present. One will also note that theintensity of the correlation coefficients is different, depending on the temporaldimensions, and that these coefficients vary slightly between the two samples.Moderating effect of ageWe will successively study the moderating effect of age on the variation in theintensity of death anxiety between the two samples, and the variation in theintensity of correlation links between death anxiety and the other temporaldimensions studied in this research. This last analysis will make it possible toknow if the slight variations observed are significant or not.380TIME & SOCIETY 16(2/3)TABLE 2Results of the univariate descriptive statisticsYoung adults N= 349Older adults N = 302Mean = mm = 9.461m = 10.392Death anxietyStandard Deviation = σσ1 = 3.85σ2 = 3.63Study of the influence of age on the intensity of death anxietyWe have tested the existence of significant differences between the mean deathanxiety of young adults and older adults. This mean was calculated based on thesummations of the scores obtained on the five items constituting death anxiety.The results of the univariate descriptive statistics are given in Table 2.The calculation of the Z test gives us a result of 3.17. Since the result issuperior to 1.96, the bilateral mean comparison test shows that the differences indeath anxiety are significant, p = 5 per cent. In our samples, death anxiety felt at47 years of age is then slightly more important than it is felt at 21 years of age.The influence of age on the intensity of the correlation links between deathanxiety and the other temporal dimensionsAccording to Byrne’s (1994) recommendations on the subject, studying themoderating effect of a variable on the links between latent factors amounts tocarrying out a multi-group analysis by testing the invariance of the parametersof measure and the parameters of correlation on several samples. This is pre-cisely why I worked with two samples: one made up of young adults, the otherof older adults. In order to do so, I used Lagrange’s test, which evaluates theeffects of liberating the parameters fixed in the initial specified model onthe decline of the ‘Chi square’, and makes it possible to improve the quality ofthe model. I then followed the classical method recommended by Byrne and Ithen simultaneously tested the invariance of the measurement models and theinvariance of the correlation links. I set constraints of equality between theparameters of measure (coefficients of regression of the different variables ofmeasure on their latent factor) for the two samples, and constraints of equalitybetween the parameters corresponding to the correlation coefficients betweenthe latent factors obtained on the sample of the young adults and those obtainedon the sample of older adults. The analysis of the results show that the quality ofthe multi-group model seemed satisfactory on the whole (Chi square = 1458, d.f.= 763, NFI = 0.901, CFI = 0.902, RMSEA = 0.053). The observation ofURIEN: SELFLESS TIME381Lagrange’s multivariate tests on the ‘constrained’ parameters of the measure ofdeath anxiety shows none of them are significant. This means that there isinvariance in the instrument of measure on the two samples. However, thisobservation of Lagrange’s test on the ‘constrained’ measures of future anxietyshows that two reductions of the Chi square (out of 13 possibilities) appearsignificant if the constraints of equality are eliminated. There is then only‘partial invariance’ (Byrne, 1994) of the instrument of measure of futureanxiety. Finally, Lagrange’s test is negative on the different constrainedparameters related to the correlation links between death anxiety and the othertemporal dimensions (future anxiety, orientation towards the future, the presentand the past). This signifies that there is invariance in the intensity of the links.The slight differences observed between the two samples in Table 1 are then notsignificant.Interpretation of the ResultsThe analysis of the results is interesting for several reasons. First, I have to admitthat fundamental dimensions such as the predominant temporal orientation andfuture anxiety are empirically linked to death anxiety, and this on two samplesof a suitable size. Moreover, these links are stable no matter what the age group.In a more detailed approach, one will observe at first the important linksbetween apprehension of the pre and post-mortem future (future anxiety anddeath anxiety). If some results have shown positive links between short-termclassical anxiety and death anxiety, my study shows that these links also existwhen anxiety towards a more distinct future is taken into account. If, as stated byZaleski (1996), this future anxiety excludes death anxiety in that it refers to afuture that ‘we will live and act in’, death can be, however, considered as asingular event of that future; and, life after death as a particular period of thelatter. The correlation between future anxiety and death anxiety can be inter-preted in the following manner: the more one is anxious faced with one’s lifespace, the more one is anxious faced with one’s death space.The existence of a liaison, albeit moderate, with orientation towards the futureis initially more surprising. In fact, it can be considered that the fact of beingorientated in a predominant way by inclination towards one’s future goes handin hand with a more acute consciousness of the limits of this future and hence amore pronounced anxiety regarding it.The links with orientation towards the past are more pronounced but stillpositive. These results confirm those of Dickstein (1975: 154): orientationtowards the past could be ‘a direct consequence of the consciousness of deathand represents an attempt to be content with the experience and to resist therapid passing of time’. Finally, a very reduced negative link with orientation382TIME & SOCIETY 16(2/3)towards the present, stable on the two samples, is observed. The more one wouldbe anxious faced with death, the less one would be orientated towards thepresent that consists in the active search for pleasure. However, the low intensi-ty of the links gives a limited significance to these results.Regarding the modifying effect of age, the result obtained shows that an olderage provokes a slight significant increase in death anxiety. These results are inaccordance with those of Gesser et al. (1987), who have observed the existenceof a curvilinear relation between the two variables, namely, that death anxiety ishighest during mid-life.ConclusionThe following observation was the starting point of this article: apart from thework done by Boyd and Zimbardo (1997), work pertaining to the psychology oftime considers the personal future principally as a life space. Yet this personalfuture is flexible enough to enable individuals to project themselves well beyondthis life space into a post-mortem future. Therefore, I suggested taking theconcept of death anxiety into account in the structure of the future. If philo-sophical reflection precedes scientific reflection, it seems important thatresearchers studying the influence of time representations on human behaviour,for example consumer behaviour, should not limit themselves to apprehendingthe future as a life space. It is also important that they explore the personal futurethat projects us beyond our physical death and induces behavioural reactions,such as the ones presented earlier.The consequences, in terms of future research, present different aspects:• Beyond the connections with the traditional temporal dimensions of thepersonal future, what are the links with the other future dimensions such as‘Consideration of Future Consequences’, ‘Future Time Perspective’, ‘Hope’?• I have studied here the role of age as a moderating variable of the linksbetween death anxiety and certain traditional temporal dimensions. In spite ofa slight increase in death anxiety during ageing, I have empirically shown thatthe intensity of the links with the other temporal dimensions is invariant.Likewise, studying the role of another moderating variable, such as religiosity,would be interesting.• In the present article, I have mainly insisted on the negative affect pertainingto post-mortem ideas (e.g. loss of social identity). Nevertheless, some authorsunderline an aspect that has been rather neglected by academia, namely themanifestations of death acceptation (Wong, 2000). In fact, one of the possiblemeans of defending oneself against the anxiety associated with ‘not beinganymore’ is to do away with the desire to ‘be’ by cutting oneself off from theURIEN: SELFLESS TIME383rest of the world. In this case, the question is how are death acceptation andtraditional future dimensions interconnected?Note1. Two meanings of temporal orientation are found in the literature: the strict sense oftemporal orientation which corresponds to ‘the predominant orientation’ towardsone or the other traditional temporal zones (past, present, future) and the broadersense of the term, which encompasses all of the temporal dimensions concerning therepresentation of time. The latter is used in this introduction.ReferencesAdam, B. and Groves, C. (2007, forthcoming) Future Matters, Marking, Making andMinding Futures for the 21st Century.Bascue, L. O., Lawrence, R.
