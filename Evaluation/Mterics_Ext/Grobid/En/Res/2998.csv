TheAnalysis of a NarrativeKaja Kazmierska ∗Abstract: This paper is based on the analysis of an autobio-graphical narrative interview with a Turkish woman livingin Germany. I analyze the process of identity changes influ-enced by the narrator’s migration experiences. It has at leasttwo aspects. One aspect refers to the cultural roots of thenarrator. New experiences have changed her self-image ofbeing a woman. A second aspect is connected with the nar-rator’s life course. The narrative shows how a naive girl hasbecome an adult and independent woman. Being a womanis defined with the help of categories belonging to Westernculture. Therefore, the process of migration is related to los-ing culturally influenced ways of describing the narrator’sidentity. As a result, she becomes a stranger in her home-land, but she also remains a stranger in the country to whichshe migrated. I analyze the narrator’s work on this problem.1. IntroductionAn autobiographical narrative interview with Hülya—a migrant woman fromTurkey—serves as an interesting example of biographical material. It enablesus to carry out the analysis of various aspects of one’s biography and socialprocesses that an individual can be involved in when migrating. This life storyexemplifies general features of the process of individuals’ mobility which canbe considered one of the characteristic phenomena of modern societies. Ac-cording to PARK (1950, p.349), contemporary migration has been transmutedfrom the previous form of invasion—caused, for example, by wars, epidemics,∗ Address all communications to: Kaja Kazmierska, University of Lodz, Institute of Sociol-ogy, Rewolucji 1905r. 41/43, 90-214 Lodz, Poland; e-mail: Kajakaz@krysia.uni.lodz.pl.First published: Kaja Kazmierska (2003, September).

Thus, inmodern societies migration does not have to be the consequence of rapid ordramatic changes in social environments when, as the result, one group is dis-placed by the other. Nevertheless, the process always affects an immigrant-receiving society. It refers to both those who migrate and to the society towhich the migration takes place. In each case it is interpreted differently. Emi-grants must face problems of adaptation in new social and cultural environ-ments; whereas the immigrant receiving society must solve problems related tonew-comers, taking into account not only their economic needs but also socialand cultural differences, which may or may not be accepted.In my country migration is still a new phenomenon if we consider Poland asan immigrant-receiving society. In comparison with Western European coun-tries it is a marginal phenomenon, although the situation has been graduallychanging since 1989. On the other hand, the people of my nation are very ex-perienced in migrating. For example, since the beginning of the 19th centurywe have had numerous huge waves of emigration due to political and economicreasons. The last remarkable wave took place in the early 1980s when commu-nist authorities established marshal law to suppress the Solidarity movement.No doubt, migration gained its specific symbolic meaning in the Polish tra-dition because of its political aspect: again and again many outstanding personshad to leave the country. In such cases, mourning the lost homeland was theirmain experience. This sorrow has been emphatically expressed in Polish litera-ture and poetry. It is enough to mention that the Polish Romantic artistic outputwas created abroad by the artists for whom longing for the country they leftbehind was the major theme of many of their masterpieces.Political reasons for Polish migration were sometimes “overused” by thosewho aimed to leave the country because for economic reasons, especially dur-ing the decade of the 1980s. During that time many people left the countryasking for political asylum, when economic needs were the real motives behindtheir decision to leave. This aspect of migration is still important and it hasalways been more significant to the majority of those Poles who decided tomigrate. In order to improve their fate Poles were leaving for richer Europeancountries, South America (e.g. Brazil), and above all, the United States. TheUnited States has always been identified in the Polish tradition as the countryof freedom and welfare. This economic immigration has been called “za chle-bem” which can be translated as “looking for bread,” and is treated in Polandas a symbol of fulfilling basic human needs. From this perspective, migrationremains an important process in the social history of Poland. These types ofPolish emigrants became protagonists of the “The Polish Peasant in Europe andAmerica” by THOMAS & ZNANIECKI (1918-1920) in which the proposal ofbiographical studies was presented. By focusing on autobiographies of Polishpeasant emigrants and their correspondence with their families back home, theauthors analyzed the process of social change.73Thus, taking into account the Polish “position” in the migration process, myanalysis has focused on the perspective of immigrants, in this case Hülya’sperspective, and not the societies that receive them. Some aspects of Hülya’slife story are not as clear to me as they are to my German colleagues knowingthe social and cultural context of Hülya’s experiences as an immigrant in Ger-many.12. The Analysis of the Narrative2.1. Introductory remarksBiographical interview analysis usually begins with expressing general com-ments related to first impressions after reading the text of the interview.2 Myremarks refer mostly to the first part of the narrative.The first comment is connected with Hülya’s command of the German lan-guage.3 According to the translator she speaks German very well; this can alsobe seen in the English version of the transcription. Hülya does not have prob-lems with describing feelings, emotions, motives, let alone events of her life.Nevertheless, her skill at describing life experiences with the help of specifi-cally selected symbolic categories is amazing. I particularly think of thesenarrative sequences in which she tells about the official procedures whichcontract laborers migrating to Germany had to pass through and about thesituation of Turkish migrants in Germany. Whenever Hülya introduces thistopic she effectively creates the image of more or less passive masses of peoplewho are at the mercy of powerful authorities. For example, she uses expres-sions (“we were just a number, not personality any more” [219], “he had to /eh/take a look, a close look /eh/ what is he paying for” [257-258], “no pride wasleft afterwards” [311]4 which seem to perfectly characterize the situation ofemigrants. In my opinion, Hülya’s description corresponds with INOW-LOCKI’s and LUTZ’s et al. (1998) remarks (presented in their paper in Mont-real) about the language used by the German authorities organizing Turkishlabor migration. Some terms like “transport,” “epidemic-hygienic reasons”(“seuchen-hygienische Gruende”) had been used by the Nazi-German regime,1 This problem is discussed in the paper of GÜLTEKIN, INOWLOCKI and LUTZ presentedin this issue.2 I refer to the stage of oral collective work on narrative interviews when each participant of agroup analyzing a specific case shares his or her first impressions with the others after read-ing the text of the interview. Although it is just an introductory step of textual interpreta-tion, it is, in my opinion, very important. It enables the participants to take into account dif-ferent frames of interpretation that may be represented by each interpreter.3 The narrator’s language abilities are deeply analyzed by FRANCESCHINI in this issue.4 The numbers in brackets refer to the line numbers of the interview, enclosed in this issue.74and they expressed doubts with regard to the “sufficient capacity” of personsdeciding to migrate. This correspondence is more pronounced when Hülya usescategories belonging to the symbolic universe of the country which she hadmigrated to. For example, she makes the comparison to gas chambers in con-centration camps: “We had a shower /eh/ downstairs for the whole house. Itlooked /eh/ like gas /eh/ chambers in concentration camps, this shower. Fromabove /eh/. All three four /eh/ of us went in there right away because the wateralways turned cold so fast” (454-457). I wonder whether she fully realizes themeaning of this comparison, especially when it is used as a means of creating agloomy image of Turkish labor migrants inhumanely exploited in Germany.A second comment relates to the first one. I have been amazed by the narra-tor’s self presentation. Hülya seems to be a person who thinks a lot (even if weconsider her specific biographical situation at the time of the interview) abouther identity problems and her emotional life. In almost every narrative segmentshe comments on her experiences. The commentaries serve to evaluate thenarrator’s past motives from her present perspective, to refer to her past state ofmind, but they also serve to “plan” or introduce future events and the narrator’sreactions: for example, “I was lucky or unlucky5 that I passed after all” (244),“somehow treated in an inhuman way, already in Istanbul” (226). These kindsof commentaries in the form of short allusions show that Hülya has developeda distance to her biographical story and that she controls it to some extent.These remarks especially refer to the first part of the narrative, when Hülyatells about her youth, and the first two years of migration. I do not suggest thatthe narration was planned and that it is not a spontaneously recounted story.6 Ijust want to stress that this style of narration and argumentation is a distinctfeature of Hülya’s story. In my previous research experience I very rarely readsuch narratives. If I did, they usually belonged to highly educated persons whohad well-developed language skills and, in general, they were often used to tellstories (for example, teachers).7 Thus, Hülya’s narrative serves as very goodmaterial for analyzing biographical work on life experiences of an immigrant.My work on this interview is based on Fritz SCHÜTZE’s procedure for nar-rative analysis, focusing primarily on its first two steps—the analysis ofschemes of communication and structural description.8 Nevertheless, I do not5 In italics I mark expressions that allusively refer to future events which the narrator as anactor could not anticipate at that specific time.6 Narration about biographical experiences should not be pre-rehearsed in order to revealwhat happened in the social area under study from the point of view of individuals acting init (SCHÜTZE, unpublished, p.3).7 In my research I mainly interview older people in Poland. I am interested in their warexperiences and usually ask them to concentrate on this phase of their lives, with the rest oftheir lives serving as background. My research interests have focused on problems of na-tional identity, displacement and the collective image of the war.8 The first step aims to identify different schemes of communication which are present in astory in order to analyze how much of the empirical text material is the result of extempore75refer directly to this stage of analytical work, e.g., I do not present detailedstructural descriptions of narrative segments. In my opinion, there are at leasttwo ways of presenting the approaches of dealing with the substance of theinterview. One refers directly to analytical steps and shows the exact way ofproceeding, the other aims to present more general comments on the casewhich had been studied. Here, I choose the second way of presentation, i.e., Ionly concentrate on a specific aspect of Hülya’s experiences as a labor mi-grant—her changes of identity.2.2. The process of identity changesAccording to Anselm STRAUSS (1969) identity is subjected to constant proc-esses of change. Although an individual tends to minimize this process andestablishes strategies for gaining a sense of personal continuity, transformationsof identity are an immanent part of each biography. Nevertheless, the change isusually processual. Following experiences gradually make an individualchange his or her self-definitions. Changes can be marked by turning pointsconstituted by critical incidents. These moments in a biography enable an indi-vidual to see the change and make him or her explore and validate new aspectsof self (STRAUSS 1969, p.93). The biographical situation of an immigrantgenerates many critical incidents which reflect the impact of this experience onone’s identity.A striking example of the ‘milestone’ is found in the autobiographies of manyimmigrants to America who later visited their native lands, only then realizinghow little affinity they had retained, how identified they had become withAmerica and Americans. Any return home, insofar as you have really left it,will signalize some sort of movement in identity (STRAUSS 1969, p.93-94).Hence, past changes can usually be clearly defined and evaluated from theperspective of the present. In the case of the analyzed narrative, subsequentvisits to their home country play a crucial role in the process of reflectiveawareness of an individual’s identity changes.The deeper the change, the more elaborated the biographical work that hasto be done in order to integrate one’s experiences into more or less coherentwholeness. Therefore, coming to terms with fragile aspects of one’s identitycan be a complicated and long-time process (STRAUSS, CORBIN, GLASER,& MAINES, 1984). Such situations particularly refer to unexpected experi-ences that can force an individual to face totally new challenges, e.g., illnessand physical disability. Biographical narrative interviews are very rich data foranalyzing this process of identity change and a narrator’s biographical work onit because in his or her story the narrator reconstructs the processual logic ofnarration of individual experiences. Structural description attempts to depict the social andbiographical processes rendered by the narrative (SCHÜTZE unpublished, p.3).76events (HERMANNS, 1987, p.50). In the case that we are dealing with here,the narrator has serious problems with her poor health that surely influence herself image, as can be seen in various segments of her interview.I am going to reconstruct the experiences of Hülya’s biography which initi-ated the process of identity change, and present her biographical work on it.However, I do not concentrate on Hülya’s experience with illness; I will onlyrefer to those dimensions of her biography that are related to the collectiveaspect of her experiences connected with the process of migration. In this con-text, identity changes can be commented on from two perspectives. The first isrelated to Hülya’s life course when the naive girl (which appears from the firstpages of the narrative) changes into the mature woman. The second is related tothe narrator’s cultural background. Social and cultural differences betweenTurkey and Germany refer to (among others) differently defined roles ofwomen in each society. In Hülya’s biography these two perspectives areclosely related to each other. Her redefinition of her identity can be understoodagainst this background.I refer to the following stages of her biography: Hülya as a young girl, thefirst and the second year of her stay in Germany, and the next four years of hermigration.2.3. Hülya as a young girlAt the beginning of the interview Hülya remembers her childhood and shepresents herself as a teenage girl living in a typical rural Turkish family. Sheseems to be a sensitive and intelligent girl. The relatively good life of her fam-ily and her happy childhood are disturbed by her father’s illness and his inabil-ity to work. Since that moment, poverty becomes the dominant experience ofher family life. Hülya, the girl, analyzes its consequences: no future for her andher siblings and a miserable position for her mother in the family. She realizesthat her mother will be permanently dependent on male members of the family.The girl also discovers what is going on “outside” of her life: She discoversthat those Turks living in Germany are well off.The poverty of her family is the first important experience of Hülya as theyoung girl. This stage of her biography has distinct features of trajectory9 initi-ated by the unexpected illness of her father. The memory of a relatively goodchildhood is replaced by the experience of poverty. She gradually realizes thatthere is no future for her and her family: “it was ... a calamity” (161). Hülya’sdream about Germany has become the only positive project for the future. Theteenage girl creates the image of her life: her temporary stay in Germany will9 Biographical “trajectory” is used here in the sense of one of structural processes of the lifecourse that represents the principle of being overwhelmed by outer events of the life coursewhich cannot be controlled by the biography incumbent. Suffering is the basic experientialmode of biographical trajectory (RIEMANN & SCHÜTZE, 1992).77change the economic status of the family. This thought has become a base ofher biographical action scheme.10 Such a project appears to be typical at thisstage of the migration process when a person creates positive plans for thefuture. The plans are “located” in the immigrant-receiving society (RIEMANN& SCHÜTZE, 1992). In Hülya’s case a biographical action scheme appearsvery early, when the girl cannot realize it yet because she is too young. At thebeginning it is just a dream and as long as the project is a dream Hülya’s ex-periences are related to intentional, planned social action regarding her futurelife. To some extent, her plan resembles a fairy tale—the teenage girl wants tobecome a fairy and change her family life. The more real the project becomesthe less it remains a dream.Hülya’s plan is contrasted with her parents’ project for her life: “No, youwon’t go to Germany, you will stay here and one day you will get marriedand/and your husband /eh/ to take care of you” (157-158). But soon her parentschange their minds and start supporting their daughter in her project, whichalso becomes their plan to solve the difficult situation of the family. Slowly,Hülya loses the ability of acting intentionally. Her parents and her brother startworking on her project instead of her. The girl’s biographical action scheme isstopped at the stage of a great dream, whereas she starts to be gradually pushedinto a sequence of events that overwhelm her biography.But from the present perspective Hülya also attributes another meaning tothese experiences. The father’s quoted words, when analyzed from the presentperspective of her biography, can be treated as a symbol of Hülya’s image oflife in Turkish society. She was expected to become an obedient woman whowould depend and rely on her future husband. Here, we can find one of themost important motives for her migration. As the teenage girl, Hülya wants toimprove the financial status of her family, but after some time it appears thatshe wants something more for herself—she wants to become more “independ-ent” from socially and culturally defined roles of a woman reflected in Turkishculture. She also does not want to be manipulated as she was when her familyworked on her leaving for Germany. This project becomes clear from the per-spective of further life experiences, but the process of its crystallization beginsat this moment. “... I wanted to be independent somehow, but I didn’t know:how, you know, but I also didn’t think about what would await me in Germanyor so” (159-161).10 I use quotation marks in order to stress that, in fact, Hülya’s departure for Germany was nota realization of the dream that she had as the young girl.782.4. The first year in GermanyThe “dream”11 comes true. Leaving the family is very difficult. The seventeenyear old girl enters the unknown world. The clash of her naive expectationswith the reality which she encounters is very tragic. This experience is typicalfor a migrant biography when an individual having positive plans looks for abetter future and gets disappointed by the circumstances and difficulties met atthe place of migration. Instead of developing biographical action schemes anindividual may enter a trajectory (RIEMANN & SCHÜTZE, 1992). In the caseof Hülya these experiences are intensified by the girl’s vulnerability due to heryoung age. Although Hülya had been pushed by her family to migrate, she stillhas in mind her plan of improving the economic situation of the family.12 As aresult, she is subjected to very harmful experiences related to both collective(all other Turkish workers are treated the same) and individual (Hülya’s acci-dents) suffering. Thus, Hülya loses her ability to act intentionally. Work ap-pears to be very difficult. She is forced to work in terrible conditions, but, at thesame time, she cannot return home:Well, I already wanted to give up in the beginning, to run away. I said, ‘Idon’t care if I have money or not. I don’t want to stay here.’ But I /eh/ alsodidn’t have money. When I came to Germany we had to take money fromother people. First, I had debts, that was an affair of honour, I had to pay thisback. And, second, I always thought, no one will believe me when I tell themwhat /ehm/ has happened in Germany. And they will think that I might havestolen something. Or... and therefore the police has sent me home and so on. Isay, ‘No’ and: I was also too proud to return again. To stay here was also /eh/hell somehow (322-329).In the quoted segment, Hülya analyzes her situation and gives the argumentspreventing her from going home. All the reasons are related to collective ex-pectations and evaluations of her behavior. First, she had to pay back the debtsthat were a matter of honor to her family. Hülya says “I had to pay this back”but I suppose that it was her father who had borrowed the money. Nevertheless,she felt responsible for delivering it. Second, Hülya felt that describing whatshe had gone through would be doubted because of the prevalent collectiveimage of Germany as a welfare state. She suspected that this image was toostrong to be shaken and she was afraid of being accused of not being equal tothe task she had taken on. Thus, Hülya is in a tragic situation, because although11 A biographical action scheme is one of the structural processes of the life course represent-ing intentional and long range planned social action regarding one’s own life (SCHÜTZE,1981).12 We can assume that if the circumstances of work in Germany had not been inhumane,perhaps she would have been able to develop (or rather come back to) a biographical actionscheme even though she had experienced difficulties at the first stage of migration (newenvironment, longing for her family, etc.).79she would like to return home, she cannot do so. There is no way out and eachsolution must cause suffering. The experience of trajectory is developing and itis strengthened by Hülya’s accidents which make her suffer (physically) morethan others.The first year in Germany may be described in the context of the entire lifestory as “a hard school of life.” The seventeen year old girl has to face unex-pected experiences, do things she would never do in her country: endure painand physical disability. Some of these experiences (like her poor health) willaccompany further phases of Hülya’s biography. Nevertheless, the first yearremains the outstanding phase of suddenly passing from the naiveté of teenagelife to the maturity of young adulthood. However, these changes are still notsupported by changes in Hülya’s image of belonging to Turkish culture. Shecontinues to act according to culturally defined patterns. It can be seen in theabove presented argument in which she relates her decisions to the expectationsof her family.Thus, Hülya continues at this stage of her biography to define herself withthe help of well known categories from her (Turkish) community. She acceptsher situation of depending on the expectations of others, including Germanemployers, because she does not have the means, both in a symbolic and mate-rial sense, to act on her own—Hülya can neither speak German nor live on herown. In this context the symbolic event representing Hülya’s first year in Ger-many is referred to in the story by the account of receiving a permit of resi-dence for the next year of her stay (418-448). She, as well as other Turkishgirls, did not have an idea of “What’s that supposed to be?” (429-430), how toarrange it and what might have been the consequences of not having the permitof residence. Hülya and the other girls were helped by the brother of a friend inthe dormitory: “we were glad ((she laughs)) and happy that (eh) someone haddone it for us” (447-448).The story about the permit of residence points out a few aspects of Hülya’sbiographical experiences of that time. I have mentioned the first aspect: anotherbiographical experience is related to Hülya’s specific vulnerability due to heryoung age. The second aspect refers to the situation of her migrant group (Ipresume, Turkish migrant workers in general). The migrants are treated aspassive parts of a working machine and they seem to comply with these cir-cumstances: “... we didn’t carry this through ourselves, the firm did every-thing” (420-421). They have no idea what their rights as workers are. Hence,they can be easily abused by the firm. Therefore, Hülya expresses in her storythe feeling of injustice. But the migrant workers also do not know enoughabout legal requirements which they have to meet as foreign citizens. There-fore, Hülya has no chance to act intentionally and she also does not feel theneed to build her independence.802.5. The second year of Hülya’s stay in GermanyDuring her first year in Germany Hülya lives as if in two worlds. One world isher work, the second world is the community of girls in the dormitory. All ofthem are in the same situation. In the second year Hülya loses her peer groupwhich has been, aside from her family, her only reference group. For the firsttime she feels totally alone. She characterizes the second year as “a hard blow.”The first year of her stay in Germany includes the experience of hard physicalwork and physical suffering. In the second year she learns how to cope with thefeeling of loneliness, and it appears to be even more difficult.Hülya starts living with Turks who have been in Germany much longer thanshe has. As she recalls:I was ../eh/ totally different /eh/ from how I am today. I am still sentimental,sensible today and I tend to act emotionally. I am not able to not look straightat someone sitting across from me /eh/ .. Neither do I—I also don’t like super-ficial people. I don’t like them either. But in former days I was even ..evenmore sensible/ I have (it) from home. Human things and and love and comfortwere important for us and only machines were important here. The humanswere not important. And then we were just /eh/ ... people practically who didthe work, we didn’t count as something else. But that made me so sad becauseour people had also become like that. Those had already been here for acouple of years, just money, nothing else, you know. They just wanted to havemoney (518-527).In the quoted segment of the commentary Hülya refers to her experience ofloneliness and suffering caused by longing for her family. These feelings areintensified by the comparison to the first year of her stay in Germany, whenthey could be soothed, at least to some extent, by her belonging to the peergroup. Now Hülya has to cope with new experiences that create feelings ofbeing different that are expressed at the beginning of the quoted segment. Thenthe narrator presents arguments to justify this feeling. Although she had alreadymentioned the lack of interest of other Turks when she arrived in Germany, itis, in my opinion, the first time she really feels that she distances herself fromother fellow Turks. There is a generation gap between her as a teenage girl andher adult co-tenants. Hülya strongly experiences the clash of worlds. She de-fines it not only in categories of age differences but also as a discrepancy be-tween her own world full of positive feelings and based on family life (perhapsa little idealized) and the world of Turkish (adult) immigrants to whom moneyseems to be the most important value. Hülya builds a contrast between herself,representing human values brought from her home, and Turkish migrants rep-resenting, in fact, a German style of life. This contrast is very important be-cause for the first time she does not define herself as a member of the commu-nity that she formally joins, and she feels like an outsider in the group of herfellow country women and men. I regard this moment as one of the crucial81turning points in the process of Hülya’s identity changes. Since that time theexperience of being different has become the basic means to describe the narra-tor’s identity.In the analyzed fragment the difference is expressed by the reference toother Turkish labor migrants and to her own image when the narrator tries toevaluate her changes of identity from the perspective of the present. Now sheregards herself as a person who, in the course of life, lost at least some part ofher sensibility and who had to redefine her identity. The statement: “I was.../ehtotally different from how I am today” (518-519) can be fully understood in thecontext of the next phases of her biography.Being different is variously experienced during Hülya’s life course. Thoughthe process of identity change is continuously developing, Hülya is still notconscious of its character (this can be determined from the present perspective)and intensity. Nevertheless, at this phase of her biography, the experience ofbeing different becomes a “key experience” which step by step results in dis-tancing herself from her family and values offered by Turkish society.2.6. The next four yearsThere are two main lines at this stage of Hülya’s biography: her marriage andphases of serious illness. This part of the narrative is not as clear as the storyabout the narrator’s first two years in Germany. But while the ambiguity of herillness as it appears in her narrative is the result of doctors’ silence, the vague-ness of Hülya’s story about her marriage shows that she tries to block fromawareness certain aspects of her biography and that coming to terms with thetransformation of her identity is still in process.In 1976 (four years after leaving home) Hülya gets married in Turkey. Dur-ing these years she has been thinking about returning home: “I didn’t want toreturn to Germany. I wanted to go back to Turkey. I could not imagine that I/eh/ would endure this here for fourteen years” (546-548). There are a fewreasons that make her treat her stay in Germany as a short episode in her biog-raphy. First, she has always planned a temporary stay in Germany; second, thefirst years in Germany were connected with experiences of suffering; third, sheis strongly attached to her family, especially to her mother (from another partof the narrative we can learn that she has always had a close relationship withher mother); and fourth, Germany is still a distant country—she does not speakGerman and she has no relationships with German people. All these reasonssupport her decision to get married.Hülya describes her marriage in two parts of the narrative (546-573 and671-731) which are divided by the long story about the health problems sheexperienced when she went back to Germany for a year as a newly marriedwoman. I do not always refer to both segments chronologically when lookingfor reasons for Hülya’s decisions concerning and explanations of her failure.82There are two significant dimensions of the narrator’s experiences: one isHülya’s attitude to her marriage, the other is the role of her mother in arrangingthe marriage.Hülya’s attitude towards her marriage is shaped by the process of a gradualchange in her identity. The experiences that she reported earlier played a cru-cial role in the process of redefining her identity. But Hülya can recognize theirmeaning from the more distant time perspective—her marriage begins theprocess of conscious reflection on her identity. Hülya has spent four years inGermany but in deciding to get married she negates experiences she has gainedduring this time. She acts according to well known patterns which are tradi-tionally grounded in Turkish society—“One day you will get married and/andyour husband has /eh/ to take care of you” (157-158). So she gets married. Butsoon she feels uncomfortable in the new situation because she cannot adjust, or,rather, come back to the role of the Turkish woman. Hülya gradually beginsidentifying herself as a person who no longer can act according to the expecta-tions of her traditional environment. Experiences of her stay in Germany ac-quire a new meaning in the process of her interpretation of her biographicalsituation.Hülya tries to explain why she decides to get married. She does not love herfuture husband and she also does not have a chance to get familiar with himand develop emotional attachments. She spent this phase of her life courseworking very hard in Germany. In this description Hülya presents two scenar-ios of the young girl. The first one is the preplanned marriage of conveniencewhich is supported by both families. The second one is getting to know some-body as the result of being a member of a peer group. As she sees it, one of thescenarios is part of traditional Turkish culture, the other, of Western culture.Although Hülya does not miss the Western teenage life style and she subordi-nates herself to her family, it is important that she has already learned that thereexists another possibility for a girl/woman to plan her biography. Perhaps asthe result of this knowledge, she makes her husband accept a one year leave forGermany in order to keep at least some independence in her future marriage.The situation when a newly married woman is leaving her husband and ne-gotiating as long a leave as possible (Hülya prefers two years) appears ratherbizarre if looking at it from the outside. A question arises: Why does she dis-tance herself from family life which she treats as the most important value?The answer is related to her identity changes. Hülya does not neglect familyties as such, but she cannot accept herself in the role of a traditional Turkishwife. Thus, the process of the destruction of Hülya’s marriage starts from itsvery beginning. The only motives to get married are identification with theTurkish culture and expectations of others (mother and father) and these mo-tives gradually weaken.It is interesting to compare Hülya’s way of argumentation with the previ-ously quoted commentary. Now she says:83I said ‘I have nothing, no money, didn’t buy anything either’ I say. At any rateI had been in Germany for four, five years.. /Eh/ ‘When I have children laterand so that I ... can tell (them) at least that I had been to Germany and that Ihad bought this or that and so on, memories and some electric things andhousehold goods and so on’ (566-570).Here Hülya uses arguments that she previously neglected when accusing “ex-perienced” Turkish immigrants of appreciating money as the most importantvalue. Now she acts in a similar way. On the other hand, she wants to go backto Germany in order to make sense of the hard work she experienced therefrom the very beginning. Hülya devoted four years of her life to support herfamily, now she wants to turn these hard experiences to her advantage.After a year Hülya returns from Germany with serious health problems. Sheexpects that her husband and his family will also experience her suffering astheir (family) problem. But to the contrary, Hülya’s duties as a wife are consid-ered by them far more important than the state of her health. As a result, physi-cal suffering caused by a series of illnesses “helps” the narrator to concentrateon her personal experiences. Hülya starts to crystallize her attitude towards thesocial environment and she slowly refuses to be a part of a marriage of culturalneed. She defines it as a cultural pattern that has become empty for her. Thus,Hülya does not describe the failure of her marriage in terms of a personal ex-perience (as she does in the case of her illness), such as lost feelings, missedhopes, unhappiness, but she does it in terms of belonging to two completelydifferent worlds. She is no longer part of the Turkish society as she had knownit before.Another important aspect influencing Hülya’s experiences is her mother’srole in organizing the marriage. Although the marriage was preplanned by bothfamilies, Hülya’s mother played a major role in this process. It is not clear tome to what extent the narrator’s mother was the one who supported her daugh-ter’s migration to Germany. Perhaps she was supporting her husband’s deci-sions. When Hülya left, her mother suffered from loneliness; she also saw herdaughter’s miserable state of health. When Hülya got married her mother suf-fered by seeing her unhappy, but at the same time she could not accept that herdaughter would try to reorganize her life (for example, Hülya’s mother did notaccept the divorce). Thus, the role of the narrator’s mother in her biography isambivalent. On the one hand, there was a very strong positive emotional rela-tionship between the mother and daughter but on the other hand it was, in fact,her mother who made Hülya accept the marriage which appeared to be a greatmisunderstanding. Nevertheless, Hülya tries to remain loyal to her mother andshe uses various strategies in order not to blame her openly. For example,through the entire interview Hülya presents her mother as her most importantsignificant other; she also stresses her mother’s suffering caused by her longingfor her and then by problems in her (Hülya’s) marriage; moreover, when Hülyasays that her mother’s expectations forced her to accept, and then continue, the84marriage for some time, she usually weakens the importance of this fact bypointing to others representing the same position, for example: “only mymother and my parents/ well, actually I was a victim (Hadn’t been constrained)but my mother and my parents/ well actually I was a victim” (729-730). Aftersaying “my mother” she immediately adds “my parents” or she says, “ourmothers, my mother and my mother-in-law have experienced life quite differ-ently. They only accept one reason for divorce, my mother or /eh/ Turkishwomen” (718-719). From this perspective her mother represents collectiveexpectations and she is not the only person to be blamed.Hülya decides to leave her husband in 1978, and gets divorced in 1980.From field notes we learn that 1980 was also the year of her mother’s death,which she witnessed. The narrator does not speak about this in her story. I findtwo possible explanations of this fact. First, she does not want to reveal thistraumatic experience in the interview situation and suppresses her mourning.Second, she does not mention her mother’s death because of the constraints ofstory telling13, she should explain the coincidence of the date of her divorcewith her mother’s death and this could cause the need for descriptions of mu-tual relationships and her mother’s role in the unsuccessful design of Hülya’sbiography. This would be true especially since the narrator identifies herself asthe victim of this design: “I always sacrificed myself for other people” (731).Although Hülya cannot see any single advantage of her marriage (the onlyconsequence was getting the status of a “divorced woman”), it is one of themost important turning points in her identity change. She becomes aware of herindependence and responsibility for her project of life. The history of Hülya’smarriage has become the first clear sign of her identity change. She starts it as atraditional Turkish woman—the daughter fulfilling expectations of her par-ents—but she quickly realizes that she is no longer the same person. The mar-riage has become a misunderstanding because her project of life no longercorresponds with the stereotypical image of a Turkish woman. Thus, the year1980 is a symbolic cutting of the umbilical cord in the sense of the closestfamily ties (that is her mother’s death) as well as social and cultural relation-ships with her home country—Hülya attains the status of a divorced womanwhich stigmatizes her in Turkish society. I think that from this moment on shestops considering Turkey as the country to which she would like to return.14This supposition can be supported by the “German” line of Hülya’s biography.In 1978 the narrator applies for compensation.15 For the first time she de-cides to act in her own behalf in Germany. “I had to learn how to go the way,13 According to SCHÜTZE there are three constraints to story telling: the constraint to closethe form, to condense, and to go into details (cf. HERMANNS, 1987).14 Although in different parts of the narrative Hülya declares her readiness to go back one day,she also mentions frequently the reasons why she does not feel like returning.15 It is also the year when she definitely decides to leave her husband and she tells aboutcompensation in the next segment of the narrative (just after the story about her marriage).85how to go to a labor court, how you (get) a lawyer /eh/ I said ‘I have to do allof this by myself. I have to get my experiences” (741-742). We may comparethis decision with her statement referring to the end of the first year in Ger-many: “Well, everyone of us got a permit of residence for three months, wewere glad ((she laughs)) and happy that /eh/ someone had done this for us”(447-448). Learning to be independent is not an easy task. She receives com-pensation but she does not achieve full success because, as she learns later, shehas chosen the wrong lawyer. Nevertheless, thanks to compensation she canstart living on her own.At the same time Hülya loses her job and, in order to earn her living, she hasto accept a job in gastronomy, treating it as a temporary situation. This work is“A kind of work which I had never ((she laughs)) liked: In the gastronomy, inthe kitchen. At that time I didn’t want to be out of work any /eh/ longer. I said‘If you want to, you can do everything’. And later on when I find somethingbetter I’d get another job” (792-793). Therefore, Hülya starts looking for a jobshe could and would like to do. The comparison of this attitude with the firstyear of Hülya’s stay in Germany shows that now she gains the ability to actintentionally and plan her life, even if she is aware of constraints on her situa-tion.In 1980 Hülya starts learning German. She decides to do it after eight yearsof being in Germany. This is another step of being independent and not atanother’s mercy, such as in the first year of her stay when she could not com-municate with German superiors. Hülya gradually learns how to be independ-ent and what it means to be independent. She organizes her life and changesfrom a passive to an active person. This change refers to both the “Turkish”and the “German” line of her biography. Turkey remains her homeland,whereas she begins to treat Germany as the country where she prefers to liveright now. The fact that she started learning German in 1980 is further proofthat this year was a turning point in her biography. Hülya definitely changedher status in Turkey. We do not know if she decided at the same time to chooseGermany as her country of residence. The idea of learning the language maysupport this supposition. Nevertheless, the knowledge of language enables herto change her status in Germany. She can no longer be considered a “workingmachine,” having no rights and being treated as “half human” because of lim-ited possibilities of communication.163. ConclusionsHülya’s first eight years of migration are a time of fundamental changes in heridentity. As I intended to present, they are related to specific sequences of the16 She presents such an image describing her first year in Germany.86narrator’s experiences as a migrant laborer. The first two years present a greatshock for her, especially given her vulnerability as a seventeen year old girl.Events of this time have made her more mature and experienced. Thus, duringthe next years the process of identity changes refers to her image of being anadult person (woman). These changes began at the time of her migration, butHülya gradually realizes that she is no longer the same person because shecannot act in accordance with the earlier concept of her identity. She verifiesthis conviction in the course of visits or vacations, her marriage, and hermother’s death. All of these experiences make her realize that she has becomeincreasingly different from the expected model of a Turkish woman: “I am notthis ... good ... little mother of the family daughter of the family who has beeninfluenced from infancy” (927-928). While living in Germany she learns howto cope with problems on her own. She tastes independence: “I know moreabout the world” (927).As I suggested, the experience of being different plays a crucial role in thisprocess. Hülya starts identifying herself as somebody who is different, at firstin her peer group, then in her Turkish environment, then in Turkish society, andfinally in German society. I have already discussed the first two aspects of thisexperience. Let me now turn to her attitude towards Turkish and German socie-ties.The quoted self-commentary and other statements show that changes in heridentity are related to different images of women in Turkish and German socie-ties. According to Hülya, such values as being financially and morally inde-pendent and having your own life project are not accepted in the cultural pat-tern of being a woman in Turkish society. Therefore, Hülya describes changesin her identity using categories referring to men’s and women’s roles in bothsocieties, and that is the main reason for feeling like an outsider in her countryof origin. Fourteen years after her migration she neither identifies with Turkeyas a country nor with the lifestyle of Turkish society. Hülya’s image of awoman is what motivates her own choices, especially her decision to live inGermany. Hülya concentrates on stressing contrasts to give a reasonable back-ground to the interpretation of her choices.The narrator has passed through all the stages of a migration process: greatplans for a better life (biographical action scheme), great disappointments whendreams clash with reality (trajectory—in her case intensified by illness), astabilization of biography (RIEMANN & SCHÜTZE, 1992). She has achievedher aim after many difficulties. But in her post-coda commentary Hülya charac-terizes herself as an “empty” person. Why is she not satisfied? What is theprice for her independence? For sure, her chronic illness is one of the importantexperiences influencing her feelings. But first of all, the “emptiness” is con-nected with the feeling of being a stranger both in Turkey and in Germany. Sheidentifies with German society but her Turkish origins remain a stigma. Thus,Hülya gains the status of a marginal person in both societies.87The case of Hülya serves as a very good example of a marginal person—theconcept introduced by PARK (1950) and STONEQUIST (1961). “The mar-ginal man is one whom fate has condemned to live in two societies and in two,not merely different but antagonistic cultures” (PARK, 1950, p.XV). Such asituation may occur as a result of migration.Although Hülya is in a marginal position in both societies, her own interpre-tation of this situation is different in the case of each country. The narrator doesnot accept the way in which Turkish society evaluates her status as a (divorced)woman. Therefore, Hülya chooses the role of marginal person in Turkish soci-ety. She distances herself from its values, and she is not up to date to what isgoing on in Turkish life, politics, economy etc. Whereas in Germany she issituated in a marginal position of not being accepted in German society becauseof her being different. Hülya represents a minority which is “partially assimi-lated and psychologically identified with the dominant group without beingfully accepted” (STONEQIUST 1961, p.121). STONEQUIST enumerates threepossibilities for a marginal person to develop his or her biography: “1) assimi-lation into the dominant group; 2) assimilation into the subordinate group; or 3)some form of accommodation, perhaps only temporary and incomplete, be-tween the two groups” (p.130). In my opinion, Hülya represents the third type.She is in-between two cultures. She has distanced herself from Turkish societyand at the same time, being a Turk, she aspires to be a member of Germansociety.The paradox of her case refers to the fact that (in terms of her present iden-tity) she is no longer a Turkish woman, and she is also not an accepted Germancitizen although she wants to be a part of German society. That is why she talksabout going back “one day.” But I think she will not because of the significantchanges in her identity.References<ref>Hermanns, Harry (1987).
