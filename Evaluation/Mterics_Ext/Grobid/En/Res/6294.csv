Frey & Daniel Waldenström ∗Abstract: »Vom Nutzen der Analyse von Finanzmärkten fürdie Geschichtswissenschaft. Eine Untersuchung anhand des2. Weltkrieges«. This article presents the analysis of finan-cial markets as a supplementary method to the traditionalhistoriographic approach by investigating the perception ofevents before and during World War II. This approach con-stitutes an alternative to written sources, which are often bi-ased and commonly do not represent the opinions held inthe wider public. In the following, the financial markets ap-proach is used to analyse the perception and anticipation ofevents before and during the World War II in France, Ger-many, Denmark, and Norway. Thereby, price data of long-term government bonds for these countries traded in Zurichand Stockholm are used. The presented evidence challengessome common held views, e.g., it can be shown that the in-vasion of Norway was in part anticipated by contemporar-ies. Although both methods rely on interpretation the finan-cial markets approach is based on a fundamentally differenttype of source. Therefore, it can be used as a supplement tothe traditional approach.1. How are countries affected by wars?A central aspect of historical research is to provide explanations for the causesand effects of events that occurred in the past. In order to be more concrete, a∗ Adress all communications to: Bruno S.

History can be analyzed and explained from different perspec-tives. This paper considers two such perspectives, the first being the traditionalhistoriographic approach, in which the main emphasis is on the qualitativeanalysis of various kinds of historical sources and documents, and the secondbeing what we call the financial market approach, a recent methodology forlinking significant changes in historical market prices to simultaneously occur-ring geopolitical events. This study seeks to identify the fundamental character-istics of the two approaches and how they compare in answering some impor-tant historical questions concerning the Second World War.Historians of the Second World War generally ask many important ques-tions in order to comprehend the main causes of war and its impact on societiesand their citizens. This study focuses on three of these questions, which aresuitable for analysis using historical financial market data. The first question is:How are countries affected by wars? This is a broad, descriptive question,aimed at characterizing the war’s main course of events, with special attentiongiven to the idiosyncratic elements in the histories of different countries. Thesecond question is: Did the contemporaries anticipate the outbreak of the war?This question does not focus on the actual war, but rather on the period justbefore its outbreak and, more precisely, on the existence of threat assessmentsamong the contemporaries. There are many possible answers, depending whatgroups in society are targeted. For example, the perceived threat of war on thepart of political and military leaders might (for informational or other reasons)differ from the threat of war perceived by the general public. Both groups areworth considering, particularly the latter, since it constitutes quite an importantgroup in democratic societies when analyzing a country’s actions. Our thirdquestion is: What were the important turning points of the war? This is an issuethat all war historiographies like to dwell upon, and the answer could be sig-nificant. According to historians, a turning point is typically the first event in aseries of incidents that eventually turn out to be important for the outcome ofthe war. Still, if one wishes to highlight the turning points that were regarded asimportant at the time of the war by the contemporaries actively engaged in it,an entirely unique set of dates may show up as turning points. Even if theseevents turn out later not to have any lasting impact on the war, they may becrucial in understanding the decisions made by people at the time. Hence, de-pending on the focus of the research question, it may vary as to which approachis most suitable.Section II of this paper presents a critical discussion of the two analyticalperspectives under comparison in this study: the traditional historiographyapproach and the financial market approach. Specific emphasis will be put ondescribing the latter, since the former has been the conventional standardamong historians for a long time and needs no further introduction. Section IIIexemplifies the financial market approach for the case of the Second World331War as reflected in the secondary market for government bonds, which is stud-ied for various countries. Section IV presents the results from the empiricalanalysis of bond market prices, and Section V presents a comparison betweenthese results and the conventional historiographic approach. The final SectionVI offers conclusions. It will be argued that both approaches rely heavily oninterpretation – but in different ways. They therefore complement each other ina useful way. The analysis of financial markets for highlighting historicalevents is seen as a useful addition to the historians’ tools. It certainly cannotsubstitute for standard analysis, but constitutes an interesting new way of ana-lyzing history.2. Two Analytical ApproachesHistory may be analyzed from several perspectives. This study considers twosuch perspectives. First, in the dominant traditional historiography, which wewill outline only briefly (for more thorough investigations, see, e.g., Garraghan,1946 or Howell and Prevenier, 2001), we point out the problems it has withproviding answers to some of the war questions asked in the introduction.Second, we present the more recent methodology, based on analyzing pricesrecorded on historical financial markets. This section identifies the fundamen-tal distinguishing characteristics.2.1 Traditional historiographyHistorians deal with past economic and political events in a certain way. Typi-cally, they carefully collect facts and interpret them in the light of their generalknowledge of the field and the particular circumstances prevailing. A majorproblem with this approach is that the interpretation of historians is necessarilyex post facto, i.e., with knowledge of later events. This knowledge may bias theevaluation of the events, and may lead to “facts” being overlooked or overem-phasized, as the case may be. This problem is most obvious in the case of wars.Once the outcome is known, resulting, for example, in the crushing defeat ofthe country being considered, it is difficult to objectively analyze why thedecision-makers of the country engaged in the war in the first place. To simplyrefer to a misjudgment is unsatisfactory, because it would require an explana-tion of how such an error could occur. In order to evaluate the historical situa-tion existing at any given moment in time, historians have to take care not toimpute information to the decision-makers of that time, the true nature ofwhich was only revealed by later developments.332Historians are, of course, well aware of this problem and they make a big ef-fort to capture the information, views, sentiments and feelings existing at agiven point in time.1 Written documents are a major source, but sometimessurveys are used (oral history). Both approaches may be biased by the strategicconsiderations of the writers and orators. In many cases, the sources have beenwritten or spoken in support of a particular cause, and are therefore far fromreflecting the reality of the situation. In other cases, the authors of documentsor interviews made a special effort to get themselves into a more prominentposition, or place themselves in a more beneficial light, again not reflecting thetrue situation.Historians tend to focus almost exclusively on various kinds of qualitativemethods and written sources, such as letters, memoirs, diaries, newspaper arti-cles etc. Since most of these written pieces of historical evidence reflect theviews of the individuals who have written them, focusing on this method is notreally suitable for drawing conclusions about views and opinions of the generalpublic in the past. In fact, historians cannot even analyze the views of smallergroups in the population in the absence of comparable and contemporaneousstatements of all the individuals in question. Hence, by mainly focusing onmaking careful in-depth analyses of recorded source materials, historians willhave a hard time of robustly reproducing the widely held views of people in thepast concerning various interesting phenomena, such as the existence of pre-war threats or the credibility of a government’s policies in the eyes of its con-stituency.2.2 The financial markets approachIn recent years, there has been a growing literature on analyzing political andinstitutional change using historical financial market data. Treating financialmarkets primarily as markets for the dissemination and distribution of informa-tion, it is possible to derive measures of the impact of political, economic andinstitutional changes on the prices of financial assets. A path-breaking analysisshows how events during the U.S. civil war affected the market for “green-backs”, a special currency issued by the Union (Willard et al. 1996). A numberof subsequent studies applied this approach to the prices of government bondsbeing traded during the Second World War. Frey and Kucher (2000, 2001)made the first studies, analyzing prices in the neutral country of Switzerland.Following them, Brown and Burdekin (2002) studied German bonds beingtraded in wartime Britain, and Frey and Waldenström (2004) compared theprices of German and Belgian bonds traded simultaneously on the neutral Zu-1 For example, in his famous treatise on history, E. H. Carr describes the writing of history asa “continuous process of interaction between the historian and his facts” (Carr 1961: ch. 1).333rich and Stockholm stock exchanges. Oosterlinck (2003) analyzed the Frenchgovernment bond market during the same period, comparing the prices of pre-war bonds with bonds issued by the Vichy regime in order to infer the timingof the turning point of the war according to French bond traders. Wolfers andZitzewitz (2005) studied the case of the Iraq war.The basic methodology followed in all of these papers is to link significantchanges, called structural break points (see the technical discussion below), inthe market prices of these financial assets to simultaneously occurring politicalor military events, from which an inference can be made about the impact ofthese events on contemporary society.2 The financial assets that have been mostcommonly analyzed in the literature are government bond prices and yields.The underlying idea is that wars put extraordinary pressure on a country’sfiscal balances and may, in the worst case, provoke sovereign repudiations ordefaults. This, in turn, increases the default risk of these government bonds,which implies that they should trade at lower prices on the secondary markets.3The use of capital market data for these analyses has several advantages.Market actors have always had to carefully evaluate the prevailing situation, aswell as likely future developments, because errors directly affect them in mone-tary terms. This distinguishes capital market data from other types of data, inparticular surveys and questionnaires, where errors do not generally affect thepersons committing them. Financial markets usually have a high predictivepower, due to so-called marginal traders. This type of trader decides on a rela-tively unbiased basis, and carefully collects the relevant information. In theextreme case, even one such trader can drive the market price to the underlyingequilibrium price.Financial markets thus are not per se related to the nation and population. Anation may disappear, but the respective financial assets may survive. Nor-mally, there is a strong correlation between the fate of a population and/ornation and the values of assets traded. In most cases, when a nation ceases toexist, its public debt is no longer serviced nor paid back at maturity, a factreflected in the financial markets by a drop in value to zero (if there is no hope2 The overlap between, on one hand, the general public and political and military decisionmakers and, on the other, the bond traders and investors, is admittedly far from perfect. Yetboth the public and the market participants acted to a significant extent on publicly avail-able information, and one would expect their views and expectations about the future to beroughly the same. As the political and military leaders had partial access to informationfrom the secret services that was not available to the general public, it will be discussed towhat extent their views differed from those of the public.3 These developments may be accompanied by minor changes in other standard bond yielddeterminants, such as the coupon rate, the time to maturity, tax status of cash flows, re-demption clauses and the discount rate. Although these were mostly constant, the breaksestimated use yield spreads (subtracting the Swedish yields), hence cancelling out market-specific determinants. These estimations produced essentially the same results, and areavailable from the authors upon request.334that the debt will ever be repaid). Similarly, if the population of a country isnegatively affected (say by natural catastrophes or a war), the respective gov-ernment may be unable to service its public debt, so that the population’s fate isagain reflected in the financial market.The possible split between the fate of the population and the nation, as re-flected on financial markets, may be advantageous or disadvantageous, depend-ing on the question asked. In any case, one must be very careful when estab-lishing a relationship between historical events and movements on financialmarkets. It may be spurious, or change over time, so that any interventions maybe misleading.We hasten to emphasize that we have never considered the analysis of fi-nancial markets to be a substitute for the traditional inquiries undertaken byhistorians. But it is a challenging complementary method of evaluating thesituation at a given moment in time. In particular, care must be taken to allowfor time delays. Thus, a historical fact may have been predicted in advance bythe people active on the financial markets, in which case the break should bevisible before the event, or be completely absent, depending on the speed ofadjustment. Either way, no break is visible at the time of the event itself. Ex-amples are the outbreak and end of a war, which in many cases are foreseenwell in advance. It should be noted, however, that financial markets tend tooverreact to news reaching them. The overreaction hypothesis implies that,even though many investors predicted an event way in advance, and financialmarkets adjusted accordingly, a break in the price series can still be identified.There are a number of technical considerations to be taken into accountwhen using financial market data. The most important of these are the choice ofeconometric method used to statistically estimate so-called structural breaks inthe time series of each financial asset, and the specific model of asset priceschosen for the computations. There are a large number of statistical methodsfor estimating structural breaks in time series. 4 The results in this study arebased on two of the most common methods in the literature for the estimationof multiple structural breaks in univariate time series: Banerjee et al. (1992)and Bai and Perron (1998, 2003). Technically, a structural break is defined as alasting significant mean-shift in the series analyzed. Both the researcher and thetotal length of the series determine exactly how long the structural breaksshould be.5 The great advantage of these methods is that they estimate thebreaks, using only the information contained in the time series properties andnot the prior knowledge of what historical events historians consider impor-4 For comprehensive overviews of the time series econometrics of estimating structuralbreaks, see Perron (2006).5 Determining the required length of a structural break is associated with the trade-off ofavoiding both short fluctuations and too long breaks that run the risk of containing morethan one “true” break.335tant.6 This means that the financial market approach is particularly suitable foranalyzing the true forward-looking assessments of the contemporaries, beforethe subsequent realization of the course of events that later became historical.We now turn to the second technical consideration mentioned above: thespecification of a model of asset prices. The results presented below are basedon modeling structural breaks in nominal bond prices or bond yields that areconditional on shifts in other nominal prices or yields. The term “conditional”has to be emphasized since the procedure corrects for effects that influence allgovernment bonds traded in a similar way. Therefore, we will not find breaksin, say, the German government bond prices as a result of changing inflation orreal interest rates. This also holds for mean differences: we only test for signifi-cant structural mean breaks of the bond prices conditional on price movementsof all government bonds traded in Switzerland. This means that an (historical)event with the same effect on the bond prices of all countries will not be recog-nized by the econometric method used. It also means that an event that leads to,say, a ten percent increase in the Swiss government bond prices, and to a fivepercent increase in the prices of all government bonds, will be shown to in-crease the conditional mean of the Swiss government prices by five percentonly.The analysis of break points undertaken here does not identify historicalfacts, but rather the acquisition and assessment of information relevant forbondholders. Wartime events are evaluated with respect to how likely they areto affect the probability of having the government bonds correctly serviced andrepaid. Thus, bond traders do not attempt to pin down what happens for its ownsake, or for some historical reason, but in order to predict what will happen tothe bonds they own, or intend to acquire. Some events are important to bondinvestors and influence bond prices, while other events do not affect the per-ceived probability to service and repay the debt, and therefore are not reflectedin bond prices.The financial market approach is based on the premise that “facts” consid-ered important by historians are reflected in changing values on capital mar-kets, in particular by bond prices. However, there are a number of reasons whyhistorical “facts” may not show up as break points:- A “fact” may be important from the historian’s point of view (it relatesto the fate of a nation, country or population), but does not affect theservicing and payback of the government bonds.- The contemporary actors do not evaluate a particular event in the sameway as historians do decades later. This difference between ex ante and6 The methods distinguish themselves from so-called “Chow tests” for structural breaks, inwhich a break point is determined beforehand and evaluated accordingly. Perron (2006)shows how this approach to the estimation of structural breaks yields invalid and inconsis-tent results.336ex post assessments is a natural characteristic of all kinds of humanaction, but few methods are able to capture it.- A “fact” does not exist, nor is it as important as the historians believe.Here, the quality of historical research is called into question. However,it would be misleading to assume that all historians identify the same“facts” as being important. So the issue is which historical school orwhich individual historian has identified what historical “fact”, as wellas the actual importance attributed to it.- The bond market data lacks quality, e.g. because there are too fewtransactions.- Governments have intervened in the bond market, either as buyers orsellers, or by imposing controls of some sort. An important case occurswhen governments want to prevent the reflection of a political (oreconomic) event on financial markets.- The econometric analysis is unable to identify break points relating tohistorical events, even though they are in the data.The next two sections illustrate the financial market approach by looking ata particular case, namely how the Nazis’ rise to power and the Second WorldWar were reflected in the government bonds of France, Germany, Denmarkand Norway.3. The Example of World War IIChanges in financial values reflect historical events. The historical events con-sidered here refer to a period starting with Hitler’s rise to power after his ap-pointment as chancellor of the Reich on January 30, 1933 and including thefirst years of World War II. The analysis is based on newly collected price dataof long-term government bonds for France, Germany, Denmark and Norway.7These prices were continuously quoted at this time on the financial markets inStockholm and Zurich. All the nations directly or indirectly involved in theSecond World War heavily interfered in, or even closed, their stock and bondexchanges. For reasons of neutrality, however, the Swiss and Swedish govern-ments refrained from doing so and their financial markets therefore remainedopen and unrestricted for the entire wartime period.8There are some differences between the two data samples. First, they coversomewhat different time periods, with the German and French bonds in Zurich7 For details on the bond data, see Frey and Kucher (2000) for the German and French bonds,and Waldenström and Frey (2007) for the Danish and Norwegian bonds.8 The Zurich Stock Exchange remained closed for two months following the German attackon the West in May and June 1940.337being analyzed from 1933 to 1948, and the Danish and Norwegian bondstraded in Stockholm only being analyzed from 1938 to 1940, i.e., the periodright before and around the outbreak of the War. Naturally, this differenceimplies that the two samples allow for different historical questions, with theNordic bond data primarily being suitable for the study of pre-war threat as-sessments, and the German and French series allowing for broader inquiry.Moreover, the Zurich data are observed on a monthly basis while the Stock-holm data are weekly. This difference in frequency does not matter greatly forthe historical analysis, except for the slightly higher amount of detail in thetiming of the estimated breaks in the Stockholm sample.The relationship between historical events and capital market developmentsis looked at from two different perspectives. On the one hand: To what extentare changes in government bond values related to historical events? Do breaksin such capital values series correspond to what have been established as cru-cial events in the Second World War? Or are there breaks in the capital valuesseries which cannot (or at least not easily) be related to War events? On theother hand: To what extent are historical events reflected in the form ofchanges in the values of government bonds? Do capital values rise or fall, andhow large and significant are the changes? Are bonds issued by the variousgovernments affected in the same or in a differentiated way? The answers tothese questions may throw new light on the Second World War.Some historical events are generally undisputed, and their dating creates fewproblems. In our context, an example would be Hitler’s appointment to chan-cellor, which occurred on January 30, 1933. Similarly, the unconditional ca-pitulation of the Wehrmacht took place in Reims on May 7, 1945, and wasrepeated on May 9, 1945 in Berlin. Great care must nevertheless be taken not todistort the past. In particular, when decisions made by people in the past areevaluated, the much more limited knowledge existing at that particular timemust be taken into account. This is particularly evident when decisions turn outto be wrong. Ex post facto, it is not easy, for instance, to understand why Hitlerand his Wehrmacht invaded the Soviet Union, because, according to what weknow from subsequent historical events, a defeat was almost inevitable. Histo-rians are skilled and make an effort to overcome these dangers by carefullystudying official and private documents, such as diaries, which are likely to berepresentative of the situation at a particular moment of time. But it is also wellknown that such documents are already the result of a selection process (withmainly those documents considered “important” being preserved), and some ofthem are even rewritten after the fact.3384. From Structural Breaks to Historical Facts4.1 GermanyFigure 1 displays the German government bond prices for the period 1933-1948. Over the whole period, there is a strong downturn of the value of Germangovernment bonds traded in Switzerland. This also holds for the period 1933-1936, i.e. for the first years of the Third Reich. The drop in bond values be-tween 1933 and 1935 may be attributed to the fact that bond holders may havefeared that the Nazis would renegotiate foreign debt, or simply stop repayment.This fear was fuelled by official policy pronouncements advocating extremeautarchy, which indicated that the Nazis would withdraw from the internationalcapital markets (Köllner 1982). In addition, heavy intervention in, and strictregulations imposed on, the capital markets on the part of Hitler’s governmentdepressed the expectations of the bond holders, who suffered a decline in theirreturns (German economic policy in the pre-war and war period is discussed ine.g. Boelcke 1985, Köllner 1982).Figure 1: German government bond price index, 1933-1948Berlin Olympics(July 1936)Czech annexation(Mar. 1939)Pearl Harbor(Dec. 1941)Stalingrad battle(Mar. 1939)War outbreak(Sep. 1939)Yalta conference(Feb. 1945)1936:011938:021940:031942:041944:051946:061948:077060)rafp50otnerce40p(xeind30ecirdp20noB1001933:12Source: Swiss National Bank, Monatsberichte, 1933-1948The partial recovery in 1937 and 1938 may be attributed to the (short-term)success of the expansionary fiscal policy (undertaken for rearmament pur-poses): national income picked up, and unemployment fell sharply. A morato-339rium on servicing foreign debt was imposed in the summer of 1933, but at thesame time the government paid back foreign debts in an effort to become asautarchic as possible against foreign countries (again for military reasons). TheNazi government thereby gained some extent of financial respectability withforeign investors in 1937-38.Hitler’s aggressive foreign policy and increasing isolation led to a drasticfall in German bond prices from the middle of 1938 to the end of 1939, whenthe Second World War broke out. The bond traders feared that the impendingwar would reduce Germany’s willingness and ability to service and repay itsforeign debt. Again there was a rise in the value of German government bondsafter the successful Blitzkrieg at the beginning of 1940. But it did not last long:from the second half of 1941 on, there was a permanent fall in German bondvalues, suggesting that the actors on the bond market expected early on that theNazis would lose the war, that the debt would no longer be serviced and thatthe capital would be lost.The econometric analysis identifies six break points for Germany. Table 1gives a survey of resulting break points and the corresponding percent changesin the conditional mean price index.Table 1: Structural break points and corresponding historical events:GermanyDateJuly 1936March 1939September 1939December 1941November 1942Price changein percent+ 8 %*– 17 %*– 39 %**– 5 %*– 6 %**Major eventsOlympic Games in Berlin (30 July – 16 August)Invasion of the Czech Republic (15 – 16 March)Outbreak of WW II (1 Sept.)Pearl Harbor, War Entry of the USA (7 – 11 Dec)Russian offensive at Stalingrad (Nov – 2 Feb)February 1945 – 34 %** Yalta Conference (4 –11 February)Notes: Percent change in the conditional mean is presented (see text for details). * and **indicate statistical significance at the 95- and 99-percent confidence level, respectively.Breaks are estimated using the method of Banerjee et al. (1992).German government bonds experienced a statistically significant and largeupward surge, beginning in the summer and autumn of 1936. In July/August ofthat year, the conditional average index rose by 8 percent relative to the condi-tional mean, i.e. the average development of all other government bonds tradedon the Swiss market. This might be attributed to The Olympic Games, whichwere held in Berlin in August 1936, and which made the Nazi regime lookpeaceful to many observers.In mid-March 1939, the Nazis invaded the remaining parts of the Czecho-slovak Republic (after the Sudetenland was given to them at the Munich Con-ference, September 29, 1938). According to many historians (e.g., Weinberg,3401994), it heralded the beginning of the Second World War. The governmentbond markets support this interpretation of history. The value of German gov-ernment bonds fell by no less than 17 percent compared to the average marketvalues. The actors thus lost even more confidence in the German government’scapacity to service and pay back its bonds (which had already been seriouslyhampered before). The invasion of the Czechoslovak Republic was the firsttime Hitler annexed territory beyond the “German” borders, which was takenas an indication that he would not stop there, and that it was likely that a majorwar would be started. However, some amount of uncertainty remained; someactors on capital markets obviously thought that the annexation of the Czecho-slovak Republic would satisfy Hitler’s demands. Accordingly, the value ofGerman government bonds dropped only half as much as when the SecondWorld War “officially” began on September 1, 1939 with German troops in-vading Poland. The actual start of the war sent German government bondsplummeting down 39 percent. The capital market was extremely pessimisticabout the prospects of a German victory.The Swiss stock exchange was closed in May/June 1940, so that the effectof the German Blitzkrieg-victories is not reflected in the data.The fourth structural break is identified in November/December 1941, butthe decline of average bond prices is rather small (around 5 percent). It reflectsa major war event, namely the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7,1941) and the subsequent declarations of war by the United States (and theUnited Kingdom) on Japan, and by Germany (and Italy) on the United States(December 8 and 11, respectively).Yet another significant drop in German bond values (again about 6 percent)occurred in November 1942. In that month, the Soviet troops started a largecounter-offensive against the German 6th Army and parts of the 4th PanzerArmy, encircling more than 300,000 German troops at Stalingrad. Traders onthe Swiss capital market considered the launching of the offensive as having amore negative affect on Germany’s future ability to service and repay its debtthan the capitulation by field marshal Friedrich Paulus three months later (Feb-ruary 2, 1943).The last break point indicated by the data took place towards the end of thewar, in February 1945. At the Yalta Conference, the Allied powers decided thatonly a complete capitulation of all German forces on all fronts would be ac-cepted, and that Germany would be divided into three military occupationzones (at that time, France was not yet recognized as one of the World Warvictors). This was seen as the final blow to the Nazis (more so than the formalcapitulation of the German military in May 1945) and resulted in a fall of Ger-man bond prices by 34 percent.3414.2 FranceThe bond prices of French government bonds, displayed in Figure 2, indicate aconstant value until the middle of 1938, followed by a huge drop, coincidingwith the “official” outbreak of War, invasion by German forces, and capitula-tion (June 22, 1940). After trading was resumed at the Swiss bourse, the Frenchbonds experienced a continuous increase in value until the end of 1945. Thevalue of the French government bonds remained above 20 percent of the emis-sion value, even though France suspended interest payments in November1942, and did not resume servicing its debts until the end of the period consid-ered. The fact that French government bonds did not drop to zero shows rela-tively high confidence on the part of the traders that France would re-emerge asan independent nation, would pay back its debts by the due date and resumepaying interest.Figure 2: French government bond price index, 1933-1948Rheinland occupation(May 1936)War outbreak(Sep. 1939)120100)rapfto 80necrep(x 60ednieirc 40pdnoB20German invasion(May 1940)Normandy invasion(June 1944)01933:12 1936:01 1938:02 1940:03 1942:04 1944:05 1946:06 1948:07Source: Swiss National Bank, Monatsberichte, 1933-1948The econometric estimates identify five statistically significant break pointsfor France (Table 2).French government bond values suffered a blow when the Germans occu-pied the demilitarized Rheinland in May 1936. To some extent, the financialinvestors may have lost confidence in the ability of the French to successfullyoppose the Nazi government’s aggressive policy. The “official” outbreak ofWorld War II at the beginning of September 1939 reduced its bond values still342further. An even stronger fall in French government bonds occurred whenFrance was defeated and occupied by the Germans in May and June 1940. Theinvasion of the Allied troops in Normandy in June 1944 was greeted as a deci-sive sign of military and political recovery, and raised French government bondvalues. The negative break point in January 1946 is not related to any obviouspolitical or military event.Table 2: Structural break points and corresponding historical events: FranceDateMay 1936September 1939May 1940June 1944Price change inpercent– 4 %*– 25 %**[ – 31 %]+ 16 %**Major eventsGerman Occupation of RheinlandOutbreak of W.W.

[..] means the difference in the bond values between the day when tradingwas stopped and when it was resumed. For methodological reasons, it is not possible to iden-tify such breaks with the econometric techniques used.4.3 DenmarkFigure 3 shows the spread of the Danish government bond yield over the Swed-ish government bond yield in the Stockholm bond market around 1938 to 1940.While the figures and tables for Germany and France just reported refer tobond prices, the following figures and tables for Denmark (and Norway) referto bond yields. Bond prices and bond yields are inversely related: while anincrease in sovereign risk is reflected by a fall in bond prices, it is reflected bya rise in bond yields. Moreover, the size of breaks is measured by a percentchange in bond prices, and by a percentage change in yields. The same changein sovereign risk is thus reflected in a lower figure in the case of bond yieldsthan in the case of bond prices. For example, an improvement in sovereign risk,resulting in a doubling of bond prices (+ 100%), means that the bond yield fallsby half, say from 10% to 5%, i.e., a fall of 5 percentage points.Evidently, there were no fears among investors about the repayment of Dan-ish bonds during all of 1938. In March 1939, however, the first sign of distur-bance is indicated by a small, yet significant, structural break point, reported inTable 3. This break is recorded immediately after the German annexation ofCzechoslovakia, and can be explained when taking into consideration thatGermany and Denmark had geographical and historical ties that resembledthose between Germany and Czechoslovakia. The actual outbreak of War inSeptember 1939 did not have much affect on the Danish yield spread, mainlybecause the Swedish yields (i.e., sovereign risk) also increased at that time.What did matter, disproportionately to the assessed war threat to Denmark,343however, was the Soviet attack on Finland in late November the same year.The Danish spreads jumped up by a statistically significant 2.1 percentagepoints in early December 1939, which coincides closely with the outbreak ofthe Finnish Winter War. In other words, the Swedish contemporaries perceivedthe aggression against Finland as a bad sign for the future prospects of theDanish government being able (or willing) to service its debt obligations toforeign bondholders. Given the close connection to wartime events, this canthen be interpreted as an increased assessed risk of war to Denmark.Figure 3: Danish government bond yield spread, 1938-1940Czech annexation(Mar. 1939)German invasion(Apr. 1940)Soviet-Finnish War(Nov. 1939)1800)ts1600nioisp1400sai(nb1200led1000iynd 800obish 600deSw 400revo 200darep 0S-2001938:011938:061938:111939:041939:091940:021940:071940:12Source: Affärsvärlden, 1938-1940.Table 3: Structural break points and corresponding historical events: Den-markSpread change inDate percentage units Major eventsMarch 1939 + 0.8 %** Invasion of the Czech Republic (15 – 16 March)November 1940 + 1.3 %** Soviet attack on Finland (30 Nov)April 1940 + 1.6 %** German invasion of Denmark (9 April)Notes: A positive sign of the estimated break, i.e., a spread increase, implies increased warrisk. Breaks are estimated using the method of Bai and Perron (1998, 2003).The final significant structural break in the Danish yields is recorded inearly April 1940, i.e., at the time of the German invasion of Denmark on April3449, 1940. This break point bears a lot of information when compared to theearlier break points in the Danish series. The reason is that, although the con-temporaries had perceived notable increases in the war threats on Denmarkbefore the German invasion, they did still not fully believe it would happen. Ifthey had, there would never have been any additional spread increase, i.e.,sovereign risk increase, when the war on Denmark eventually broke out. In thisway, we can infer the assessed likelihood of a war outbreak in the eyes of thecontemporaries during the pre-war era by relating the observed market yields atthe time of the outbreak and the pre-war yields (for further details, see Walden-ström and Frey, 2007).4.4 NorwayFigure 4 shows the yield spreads of Norwegian government bonds traded inStockholm for 1938-1940. Broadly speaking, the evolution of the spreads inNorway in this turbulent era resembles the corresponding evolution in Den-mark. Before the German invasion of Norway on April 9, 1940, the financialmarkets in Stockholm seem to have perceived a constant build-up of warthreats to Norway. Three positive structural breaks indicate this, as reported inTable 4. First, in March 1939, there is a small, but significant increase in theNorwegian spread, which may be related to the German annexation of Czecho-slovakia. Second, there is a larger significant structural break estimated at theend of August 1939, directly after the non-aggression pact between Germanyand the Soviet Union (the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact) and right before the Ger-man attack on Poland. Third, there is a break dated in late December, whichcoincides in time with recent war activities between Finland and the SovietUnion. In other words, financial markets clearly perceived an increased warthreat to Norway well ahead of the actual war outbreak in 1940.However, the Norwegian yield spreads in Stockholm also contain two sig-nificant structural breaks in 1940. The first shows a large positive break, i.e.,signaling an increased risk of a Norwegian sovereign default, dated late April1940. This break is clearly associated with the German invasion of that month.Notably, as in the case of Denmark, this break suggests that the contemporarieswere not convinced that Norway would eventually be involved in the War,because that would have implied that yield spreads should not have changedsignificantly in response to the invasion. A fifth and final break is dated August1940. The exact date of this break is uncertain due to the volatile bond prices ofNorwegian bonds after the German invasion (most likely due to low levels oftrading). Still, it coincides with the surrender of the Norwegian military resis-tance to the invaders, and interestingly it seems as if the bond market actorsinterpreted this major blow to the Norwegian sovereignty as positive for thelikelihood of their bonds being serviced by the Norwegian government.3451200)stion1000psisab 800ni(dliye 600dnohb 400siderSw 200evoead 0rpSFigure 4: Norwegian government bond yield spread, 1938-1940German invasion(Apr. 1940)Soviet-Finnish War(Nov. 1939)Molotov-Ribbentrop(Aug. 1939)Czech annexation(Mar. 1939)Resistance ends(Aug. 1940)1938:11 1939:041939:091940:02 1940:071940:12Table 4: Structural break points and corresponding historical events:Norway-2001938:01 1938:06Source: Affärsvärlden, 1938-1940.DateMarch 1939August 1939December 1939April 1940August 1940Notes: See Table 3.Spread change inpercentage units+ 0.2 %*+ 1.0 %*+ 0.1 %**+ 2.0 %**– 0.6 %**5. From Historical Facts to Structural BreaksThe above sections present the empirical results of the financial market ap-proach to analyzing history. Several interesting findings are revealed. Some ofthe events that are generally thought to be crucial are clearly reflected in theGerman and French government bond prices. This holds, in particular, for the346Major eventsInvasion of the Czech Republic (15 – 16March)Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (26 Aug)Soviet attack on Finland (30 Nov)German invasion of Denmark (9 April)Norwegian resistance surrenders(July/August)official outbreak of the war from July to September 1939. It markedly reducedthe government bond values of Germany (by 39 percent) and France (by 25percent). The same holds for losses and gains of national sovereignty. WhenBelgium and France were defeated and occupied by German forces in the Blitz-krieg of May 1940, the German government bond values rose by 8 percent andthose of France fell by no less than 31 percent. The same holds in the case ofthe two Nordic countries analyzed, Denmark and Norway. The German inva-sion in April 1940 was clearly noticeable on the bond market, with sharp in-creases in the perceived risk of a sovereign default, according to falls in thecountries’ bonds.At the same time, we also note that certain events to which historians attachgreat importance are not reflected in bond prices at all: the most prominentexample is the capitulation of the Wehrmacht in May 1945, which is neitherreflected in the German nor French government bond prices. The Allied inva-sion in Normandy in June 1944 raised the French bond values (by 16 percent)but did not lead to a break in the values for Germany. In the case of Denmark,the non-aggression pact between Germany and Denmark at the end of May1939 did not influence the bond market’s perception concerning war risks onDenmark at all.Finally, the results indicate situations where the claims of historians mayeven be questioned by the financial market evidence. For example, Nordichistorians have regularly argued that the contemporaries in the Nordic countriesdid not perceive any increased risk of war to their own countries in the periodbefore the war, i.e., in 1939 and early 1940.9 By contrast, the estimated struc-tural breaks for both Denmark and Norway clearly indicate that the sovereignrisk of these countries increased significantly in connection with war-relatedgeopolitical events, and could be clearly interpreted as increasing the militarythreat against these countries.6. ComparisonThe above discussion reveals that the traditional historiography and the finan-cial market method approach history from very different points of view. De-spite this fundamental difference, the two approaches share the fact that theyboth rely on interpretation – but what must be interpreted differs considerably.Standard historical research has to interpret the reliability and meaning ofthe documents studied and interviews with the decision makers at that time.Historians are trained to do this very carefully in order to understand what was9 For references and quotes of more than a dozen Nordic Second World War historians, seeWaldenström and Frey (2007).347thought at the time and not confound the situation with information availableonly after the fact. This is sometimes extremely difficult, if not impossible. Forinstance, today’s historians must seek to understand why the Nazi governmentengaged in war, even knowing that they would lose.The financial market approach is based on data only containing the know-ledge available at the respective time; subsequent time only enters into theequation through the expectations of the market participants, again at the re-spective time. The financial market approach is not faced with the problems ofstandard historical approach, but has other major problems of interpretation. Inaddition to the problems common to econometric estimations, the most impor-tant ones are:- Why are some of the break points identified not related to any majorpolitical or historical event (such as the negative break point in January1946 for French government bonds)?- Why are some important historical facts not visible as break points(such as the capitulation of the Wehrmacht in May 1945)?A handy explanation refers to the notion that financial market values do notshow any reactions or breaks if the traders already took the respective historicalevents into account, i.e. if they are already “priced in”. This may, for example,be argued for the German capitulation, which was imminent, and which traderssaw coming some considerable time before May 1945. Such an explanationmakes sense, but it is somewhat ad hoc. The same could be said of otherevents, such as, for example, the invasion of Normandy. It has still not beenexplained why this event (positively) affected the value of the French govern-ment bonds only, but did not affect the value of the German bonds.Another issue of interpretation is due to the government bond market captur-ing the expectations of a special group of people active in these markets. Theseare not only the actual traders working on these financial markets. The groupinvolved comprises a much larger group of actors influencing the supply anddemand of these assets. It is not known who the buyers and sellers on the gov-ernment bond market were during the period in question. It may well be, ofcourse, that these actors differed substantially from the political and militarydecision makers, who were responsible for war activity. The approach mayallow us to identify not only the motivations of persons interested in financialprosperity, and hence presumably the economic prosperity of a country, butalso the motivations of politicians and the military, which might have morenarrow interests and might be subject to over-optimism and hubris.7. ConclusionThe two approaches to analyzing history discussed here – the standard histo-riographic approach and the financial market approach – each have their spe-348cific strengths and weaknesses. Without doubt, a careful study of documentsand interviews with the decision makers at the time can reveal important in-sights. In many cases, it is the only feasible and reasonable method. In the caseof the Nazi rise to power and the Second World War, it is indispensable toconsider what was written and said at the time by the political and militarydecision makers. Still, when it comes to representing widely held pre-warthreat assessments, an in-depth interpretation of a few written sources is hardlysufficient for capturing the views and opinions of the public at the time.The financial market approach presented here may, in such cases, be a use-ful, and perhaps, so far, underutilized, complementary method, offering addi-tional insights. For example, it was found that some of the conventional histo-riography concerning the widely held pre-war threat assessments in the Nordiccountries disagrees with the estimates of the corresponding threat assessmentsaccording to the contemporary financial markets. But this approach also suffersfrom potential methodological problems with, e.g., the econometric methodsused, which rely on choices and assumptions that are questionable. Therefore,the two approaches should not be seen as exclusive of each other, but rather ashelping us to see specific aspects of history more clearly and in a differentlight.ReferencesAffärsvärlden (various issues), Stockholm.<ref>Bai, Jushan/Perron, Pierre (1998): „Estimating and Testing Linear Models withMultiple Structural Changes“.
