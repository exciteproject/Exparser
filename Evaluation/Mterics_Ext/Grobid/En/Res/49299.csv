IntroductionIn qualitative studies, researchers often rely on retrospective data collectionmethodologies to investigate people's experiences. When the inquiry involvessensitive issues and requires participants to voice descriptive and emotionalstories, the use of appropriately sensitive data gathering methodologies isimperative (GUENETTE & MARSHALL, 2009). In this article we describe theutility of using a retrospective data collection tool called the lifegrid (LG) inexploring adolescent substance abuse from the perspective of mothers and theirsubstance abusing adolescent children (hereafter referred to adolescents).

In addition, parents' lives and parent-adolescent relationships are profoundly impacted by adolescent substance abusegiven the various psychosocial and economic stresses associated withadolescent substance abuse (see for example JACKSON & MANNIX, 2003;JACKSON, USHER & O'BRIEN, 2007; USHER, JACKSON & O'BRIEN, 2007;WEGNER, AREND, BASSADIEN, BISMATH & CROS, 2014). In light of this wesurmised that the trauma that adolescents and parents may have experiencedcould influence the kind of information they are willing to recall. In order tofacilitate recall of these events we thought to use a data collection tool that willlend itself to recall and discussion of sensitive events. [2]In the following sections we provide an overview of the LG and the methodologyof our study. We will then discuss our findings in relation to the usefulness of theLG. Finally we outline some of the practical challenges we faced in using the LGand provide some ideas on how to overcome these challenges. [3]2. About the LifegridThe LG is a tool used to construct a visual chronological framework of a person'slife (RICHARDSON, ONG, SIM & CORBETT, 2009; WILSON et al., 2007). Itgenerally takes a chart-like structure with several rows and columns, where therows usually represent the person's life in years (each row is a particular year)and the columns represent significant life events (WILSON et al., 2007). Thesignificant life events are selected aspects of the participants' lives that theresearcher wishes to explore. These aspects are closely related to the researchquestions of the study and can include topics such as family life, friends andsocial relationships, place of residence, occupation and so forth. For example, theLG was used to explore the life course of cancer patients using selected aspectssuch as "personal life events," "education, lifestyle," "residence," "occupation"and "other" (NOVOGRADEC, 2009, p.2). A completed LG then allows theresearcher to assess how the participant's life has changed over a certain periodof time and when these changes occurred. When the LG is used to facilitatequalitative data gathering, it further allows the researchers to unpack how theparticipants experienced and managed these changes. [4]The lifegrid tool was developed to address research concerns related toparticipant recall and validity in retrospective medical studies (BELL, 2005). It hastraditionally been used to collect quantitative data on the development ofillnesses, pain and health behaviors (BERNEY & BLANE, 1997; PARRY,THOMSON & FOWKES, 1999; RICHARDSON et al., 2009). The core focus ofthe earlier studies (see BERNEY & BLANE, 1997; BLANE, 1996) was to use theLG to improve the accuracy of the recalled information (BELL, 2005). BERNEYand BLANE's (1997) study assessed the accuracy of older participants' recall ofevents that stretched over 50 years prior to the interview. The events theyFQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 16(3), Art. 24, Candice Groenewald & Arvin Bhana:Using the Lifegrid in Qualitative Interviews With Parents and Substance Abusing Adolescentsfocused on were "external" events like wars and strikes, "family" events such asbirths and marriages, residential events and occupational events (ibid.). Whencompared to the historical records of the participants, the findings indicated thatresidential and occupational information, like fathers' occupation or residentialaddress, was recalled with more accuracy than detailed information on childhoodillnesses and dietary requirements (ibid.). [5]Recent studies suggest that the potential of the LG extends beyond collectingquantitative data and improving recall accuracy. Research by BELL (2005),HARRISON, VEECK and GENTRY (2011), NOVOGRADEC (2009) and WILSONet al. (2007) show the usefulness of the LG to facilitate participant engagement inqualitative interviews. BELL (2005, p.53) however warns that while the LG mayimprove the quality of the data collected, it could also restrict "the extent to whichinterviewees feel able to discuss events not covered by the life-grid." In our study,the LG was therefore used to compliment the semi-structured individualinterviews conducted with the participants and support them to talk about theirexperiences. [6]3. Methodology3.1 Summary of formative workThe LG approach was piloted on one mother and her adolescent son who hadbeen admitted to a substance abuse treatment center for cannabis abuse (n=2).The aim of the pilot was to determine how, and in what time sequence, weneeded to conduct the LG interview with the study participants. Additionally, wewere interested in identifying some of the initial significant life event categoriesthat we could include on the LG table for the overall study. Once identified, thesecategories were included on the LG table as examples of significant events andadditional category options were provided should the participants identify othersignificant events. [7]Both the mother and the adolescent were interviewed at their home on threeoccasions over a period of one month. The first interview was structured to buildrapport between the researcher and the participant and included questions aboutthe participant's family, school or work background, social relationships andrelationship with each other (parent-child relationship). Given that we wanted touse the LG during the second interview, we also included questions that focusedon when certain experiences occurred and when relationships changed. Forexample we asked the mother: "When do you think your son started usingdrugs?" and "When did you start noticing a change in your relationship with yourson?" [8]FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 16(3), Art. 24, Candice Groenewald & Arvin Bhana:Using the Lifegrid in Qualitative Interviews With Parents and Substance Abusing Adolescents3.1.1 Pilot interview with mother participant: OutcomesFollowing the first interview with the mother, the interviewer (first author) partiallyfilled in the LG with some of the information that was gathered during the firstinterview. The partially completed LG was then co-completed during the secondinterview. In this case, the mother indicated that she would like the interviewer tocontinue filling in the grid on her behalf as she did not want to do the actualwriting but was comfortable to do the activity. [9]The second interview with the mother commenced with a recap of the LG. Thishelped ensure that the mother was primed to discuss her experiences in greaterdepth using the partially completed LG as a guide. The LG approach proved to beuseful during this interview both as a means to document information chronologically,and facilitating the recall of events and experiences. It is our experience that theLG was well received, appeared to be easily understood by the mother, andallowed us to ask sensitive questions (described in the findings). [10]3.1.2 Pilot interview with adolescent participant: OutcomesThe pilot continued with the adolescent participant. Given the favorable outcomesof the interviews with the mother, we decided to incorporate the LG during thefirst interview with the adolescent to determine how he will respond to a blank LG.The same processes were followed as with the mother: the LG was introducedand explained to the adolescent and was then co-completed. This approach wasfound to be acceptable because, as in the case of his mother, the LG appearedto have been understood and easy to co-complete. Practically, using the LG inthis way also allowed the interviewer to check and therefore capture theinformation more accurately without having to correct it in a next interview. Thefindings section of this article will provide a more detailed account of theusefulness of the LG in facilitating participant recall, discussing sensitive topics,and cross checking and validating participant information. [11]3.2 Study participantsGiven the various challenges associated with the accuracy of participant recall inretrospective studies, researchers have since argued that the inclusion ofcollateral informants are useful for increasing confidence (some would sayreliability) in subject self-report (AMODEO & GRIFFIN, 2009). We thereforeinterviewed five parent-adolescent pairs, each consisting of one mother and heradolescent who had been admitted to a substance abuse treatment center.Discussions centered on issues pertaining to the development of the adolescentsubstance abuse, experiences of parenting an adolescent substance abuser andbeing an adolescent substance abuser (respectively) and the strategies parentsemployed to cope with the adolescent's substance abuse. We were interested inthe participants' current experiences and feelings associated with theadolescent's substance abuse, as well as their recollections of the past and howthis might have contributed to the way they currently feel. [12]FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 16(3), Art. 24, Candice Groenewald & Arvin Bhana:Using the Lifegrid in Qualitative Interviews With Parents and Substance Abusing AdolescentsEach participant was interviewed once using the LG method and the informationgathered during the LG interview was discussed in greater detail. Where needed,each participant's LG was used to facilitate these additional discussions.Scheduling of the interviews was also dependent on the availability of theparticipants. The mothers and adolescents were interviewed separately andconfidentiality was strictly adhered to. This meant that none of the informationdiscussed with the mother was shared with the child and vice versa. Separateinterview schedules were developed for the mothers and adolescents, althoughquestions pertaining to the development of the adolescent's substance abuse,parent-adolescent relationships, and parental coping strategies for theadolescent's substance abuse formed part of both the interview schedules. Thisdata formed the basis of interviews on the second occasion using the LG. [13]3.3 Study processesFollowing BELL (2005) and WILSON et al.'s (2007) examples, an A3 landscapesheet of paper to map the interview with the mothers and their adolescentschildren was used. The adolescents' LG comprised eleven columns by roughly 30rows, depending on the age of the participant. The mothers' LG was elevencolumns by about 50 rows. Extra rows were provided in order to have enoughspace should there be more than one significant event per year to document. Inusing the LG we were interested in when significant events occurred and how theparticipants experienced these significant events. We considered eventssignificant when they provided us with information on the development of thechild's substance abuse, the effects of the child's substance abuse on his/herwell-being, and the effects of the child's substance abuse on the mother and thefamily as a whole. For example, one of the questions we asked the mothers was:"when did you first become aware of your child's substance abuse?" with followup questions such as "tell me about how you felt when your child told you that hewas using drugs?," "when did you start feeling this way," and "how did you dealwith it (a particular challenge)? [14]The participants generally requested that the interviewer complete the LG.Although this was not planned, it ensured that "completing the grid did notinterrupt the flow of the interview" (BELL, 2005, p.56). Participants were then ableto engage with the questions and provide responses without being concernedabout issues such as spelling and whether they are doing it right. [15]Given that a blank lifegrid could prove to be daunting to participants with complexnarratives (WILSON et al., 2007), we decided to introduce the participants to theLG in the first interview indicating that we would return to it during the course ofour meetings. The interviewer explained that the LG will be used during theinterview to document particular issues as they emerge. It was also made clearthat there is no right or wrong answers and that the information that will be writtenis fully dependent on what will be discussed during the interview. Lastly, it wasmade clear to participants that their respective LGs will not be shown to oneanother as to ensure that confidentiality is respected.

FindingsDrawing on extracts from our interviews, this section will discuss our findings onthe usefulness of the LG in relation to the following themes: Building rapport,Enhancing depth and range of recall and Cross-referencing and comparing ofevents. Each of these themes will be discussed in turn followed by a discussionon some of the challenges that we encountered and how we resolved these. [17]In this article, our interpretations of the themes are illustrated using extracts. Inthese quotations, square brackets contain material provided by us forclarification. Ellipsis points "(...)" indicate that the participants' thoughts havetrailed off and uppercase letters are used to illustrate emphasis. A pause isillustrated by "(.)" and interruptions are indicated by "=." [18]4.1 Building rapportWe found the LG useful to establish interviewer-participant rapport and "breakingthe ice" (WILSON et al., 2007, p.140; see also HARRISON et al., 2011, andPARRY et al., 1999). Following general introductory questions such as "tell meabout yourself," the interviewer used probing questions focusing on where andwhen the participants were born, where they are currently residing, residentialmovements, academic performance (for adolescents) and occupation (for adults).The interviewer wrote this information onto the LG and the participant checked tosee if it was documented accurately. In line with findings presented byHARRISON et al. (2011, p.221) the co-completion of the LG facilitated theinterviewer-participant relationship as it could be perceived as "a team workingtogether to complete a common task, much like two strangers collaborating tocomplete a jigsaw puzzle." WILSON et al. (2007) add that the practicalcompletion of the LG averts the need for continuous eye contact which canfurther put participants at ease, especially when sensitive issues are discussed(also see HARRISON et al., 2011). Additionally, SHERIDAN, CHAMBERLAINand DUPUIS (2011) indicates that in using graphic elicitation methods like theLG, the interviewer and participant reciprocally engage in the research whichcould encourage the participant to become aware of his/her own agency (seealso KESBY, 2000). [19]4.2 Enhancing depth and range of recallThe LG proved an effective approach in encouraging participants to providedetailed accounts of their experiences. While the LG was initially completed in achronological fashion using the biographical information, it was flexible enough toallow participants to move between significant events when discussing theirexperiences.FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 16(3), Art. 24, Candice Groenewald & Arvin Bhana:Using the Lifegrid in Qualitative Interviews With Parents and Substance Abusing Adolescents"Researcher: Is that when you went to formal school like big school? Cause that'swhen you went to gradeInterviewee: grade 1.Researcher: Uhm, did anything big happen for you during that time? Did anythinghappen at home, with your family?Interviewee: [silence] no. I am confused now. I forget in here that my granny died!Researcher: Oh the year your granny died?Interviewee: YesInterviewee: YeahResearcher: So your granny died somewhere?Researcher: How old do you think you were?Interviewee: Eight or nine that time" (Winston, 15 years, cannabis abuser). [20]Similarly, Abigail, a 16 year old girl who had been referred to the treatment centerfor her harmful alcohol use, was able to control the discussion and talk about herexperiences as she remembered them. In this way she was not restricted by arigidly structured interview approach which may have prevented her from sharingher story as openly as she has. In telling the interviewer about her drinkingpatterns she is reminded of a particular event that she considers significant thathad occurred in the previous year, but had forgotten to tell the interviewer about it."Researcher: Okay I see, so then tell me about the next time you drank again.Interviewee: Yah, after exams, HEY! I forgot something, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Now weare going very back!Researcher: Oh Glory! Reverse. Let's go back. Are we going back to last year?Interviewee: Our last paper, me and my friends were at [a park]. So we buy [vodka],we buy a six-pack, a six-pack of [ciders]. Yah those are the 3 things we bought andwe go chill at the park.Researcher: How many of you were there?Interviewee: Five.Researcher: You were five with a bottle of [Vodka], a six-pack of [ciders]Interviewee: No a six-pack of [a particular brand of ciders] and a six-pack of [anotherparticular brand of ciders]. And we drink the six-packs first. Okay Jess, one of myfriends, she didn't drink much. She only drank the six-pack she didn't drink theVodka. So we decided okay lets drink the Vodka. Now we in [the park] the worstplace to [be]! Anyway we didn't think of that at the time. So we drinking and uhm[Laughter]Researcher: Oh goodness, what did you do?Interviewee: No, I didn't do anything wrong, I just passed out and the police van cameto fetch me and parents were called" (Abigail, 16 year old, alcohol abuser). [21]This flexibility of the LG is apparent in the way that it allowed the conversation togo back and forth between dates and/or significant events. This was useful asassociated events trigger memories that might not have been remembered. ThisFQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 16(3), Art. 24, Candice Groenewald & Arvin Bhana:Using the Lifegrid in Qualitative Interviews With Parents and Substance Abusing Adolescentsfurther allowed the interviewer and participant to document particular events anddiscuss them in detail later in the interview or in a follow-up interview. This isparticularly important for sensitive research such as the current study as it allowsthe participants the space to pause or return to certain issues when they areready to discuss those (WILSON et al., 2007). This was also a key finding intimeline research conducted by SHERIDAN et al. (2011) on fatness and weightloss. In this way, the LG also acts as a reminder to the interviewer about thesignificant issues s/he wishes to discuss in detail which "provides direction to theinterview when needed (HARRISON et al., 2011, p.222). For example in the firstextract below, Winston talks about the supportive and comforting relationship hefelt he had with his cousin before his drug abuse. This conversation soon turnedvery emotional for him and the interviewer decided to change the focus of thatdiscussion and asked him to comment on the support he received at thetreatment center."Researcher: So is that = what did you feel that time?Interviewee: I felt like I never wanted to talk about it. But you see me and my smallcousin we use to talk about it.Researcher: =YeahInterviewee: = we use to talk about our stories cause me and him we almost like thesame you see [emotional]Researcher: I see, so how much younger is than you?Interviewee: He's in grade 9 now.Researcher: So you guys are, almost ... you close [in age]Interviewee: Yeah we close [crying]Researcher: So you had someone that you could speak to but it was a youngercousin?Interviewee: Yeah.Researcher: Is that why you actually enjoyed being at [treatment center] because youhad that space to=Interviewee: =talk to someone yeah" (Winston, 15 years, cannabis abuser). [22]Later in the conversation, the interviewer was able to ask Winston about hisrelationship with cousin again."Interviewee: I never use to feel it [abusing cannabis] was wrong.Researcher: Never felt it was wrong while you were smoking?Interviewee: NoResearcher: But you felt it was wrong when other people, when this boy was withyou?Interviewee: Yeah, only when my cousin was with me.Researcher: So why is that? Why do you think you felt?FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 16(3), Art. 24, Candice Groenewald & Arvin Bhana:Using the Lifegrid in Qualitative Interviews With Parents and Substance Abusing AdolescentsInterviewee: No, because I felt, I know me and him were going through the samething. Now I don't want him to be like me! So I was trying to show him that there= noI'm not in bad stuff and you mustn't do that there!Researcher: Yeah, so you feel that you wanted to be a role model for him?Interviewee: YeahResearcher: [pause] so this seems to be like difficult for you again, to speak about,especially this particular topic.Interviewee: I don't know, because when I was drinking ... I never want to show himthat I was still at it, I wanted to show him the good way, but I was still at it.Researcher: And then talking about it now, makes you feel ...Interviewee: Makes me feel bad" (Winston, 15 years, cannabis abuser). [23]Furthermore, while some researchers might argue that the information collectedin LG interviews can be elicited in conventional questioning, we found the LGuseful in encouraging the participants to tell their stories in a less confronting andmore innovative way (SHERIDAN et al., 2011; WILSON et al., 2007). WILSON etal. (2007) point out that conventional interviewing have the potential to be boringand repetitive. The LG, they argue, was useful in their work to discuss sensitiveissues without confronting participants with a long list of personal questions(ibid.). SHERIDAN et al. (2011) further add that timeline interviews can representan "aide-memoire, focusing attention beyond what is possible through talk alone,thus becoming not only a piece of data in its own right but a vehicle throughwhich further data were produced" (p.554). In this regard, it is our experience thatthe LG itself represented the lives of the participants during the interviews in sucha way that it became the object of discussion rather than the parents'experiences. This physical focus on the LG might have encouraged theparticipants to tell their stories more openly as they are perhaps indirectlyreflecting on their lives, emotions and experiences through the LG. [24]4.3 Cross-referencing and comparing eventsThe LG is usually completed by one participant at a time (see for exampleBERNEY & BLANE, 2003; HARRISON et al., 2011; NOVOGRADEC, 2009;RICHARDSON et al., 2009; WILSON et al., 2007), although studies have usedthe LG with couples who completed it together (BELL, 2005). We used the LGwith adolescent-parent pairs in which the adolescents and parents completedseparate LGs. This allowed us to compare the adolescent and parent's accountsof similar events. In instances where the adolescent or the mother neglect todiscuss a significant event (like parents' divorce, death, admission to substanceabuse treatment centers, etc.) the interviewer was able to pick this up anddiscuss it with the other. This was at times a challenging activity as it required theinterviewer to probe for significant events that were not mentioned without makingthe participant aware that she received this information from either the mother orchild (bridging confidentiality). The extract below highlights the complexity, andusefulness, of cross-referencing in our study. Jacky, who is the mother ofWinston, told the interviewer on a previous occasion that during his drug abuseFQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 16(3), Art. 24, Candice Groenewald & Arvin Bhana:Using the Lifegrid in Qualitative Interviews With Parents and Substance Abusing AdolescentsWinston had left home for a while to stay with his brother. For us this wassignificant as his brother was a cocaine user at that time and we were interestedin whether living with his brother encouraged his drug use."Researcher: Okay. And you were still with your mommy during that year you nevermoved anywhere, or visit anybody?Interviewee: No.Researcher: Going to visit to?Interviewee: I don't, only use to go visit my family there, the ones the ones that are in[place], yeah only themResearcher: And how [were] things with your brother during this timeInterviewee: My brother, he never use to stay hereResearcher: Here, but did you see him at all?Interviewee: Yeah, he used to come see us.Researcher: Yeah, and did go visit him at all?Interviewee: Yeah I use to go visit him cause I use to see his son, cause his sonalways, his son just use to like me ...Researcher: YeahInterviewee: Yeah use to visit his son.Researcher: That so cute ...Interviewee: Then I use to visit his son.Researcher: Big uncle ... so but you never, you just went visit him but you never useto stay there or anythingInterviewee: I use to stay there but I use to come back home yeah.Researcher: You came back home. So how long did you used to stay there?Interviewee: It's about 3 months" (Winston, 15 years, cannabis abuser). [25]In a similar instance, Margaret, the mother of Abigail, indicated that she onlybecame aware that Abigail had used alcohol hazardously once she was caughtdrinking at school and consequently referred to the treatment center. However,Abigail's narrative reads differently and indicates that her mother had been awareof her prior drinking habits. She explained that after she had gone drinking withher friends in the park, she consumed so much alcohol that she "was knockedout. I don't know what happened! The police came [and] parents were called.""Researcher: So they call the parents to come get the children, so your mothercomes in and what does she do?Interviewee: My mother was in the car and my guardian that comes to stay herekicked and slapped me to wake me up, but I wouldn't wake up.Researcher: You wouldn't wake up?Interviewee: No, and they got me into the car. They got me home, I had a bath, and Iwoke up the following morning, not feeling so good.Researcher: And what happened with you and your mom?FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 16(3), Art. 24, Candice Groenewald & Arvin Bhana:Using the Lifegrid in Qualitative Interviews With Parents and Substance Abusing AdolescentsInterviewee: She was quite angry with me. Very, very angry with me. That's when sherealized that I=Researcher: You drink?Interviewee: I drink, but then she thought I stopped, not knowing that I didn't actually.And yes she was angry with me for a few days but then after me apologizing andsaying 'I'm sorry I didn't mean to disappoint you' she forgave me.Researcher: Yes, but were you sorry?Interviewee: Yes I was sorry. That was an embarrassment" (Abigail, 16 year old,alcohol abuser). [26]One possible reason why Abigail's mother did not tell the interviewer about thisoccasion was that she, like Abigail, might have been too embarrassed byAbigail's behavior. What this finding highlights is the significance of cross-referencing and the usefulness of the LG interview in facilitating this process. Inthe same way the LG allowed us to identify the silences in the participant pairs'accounts; i.e. what the mothers identify as significant compared to what the childdoes not (and vice versa). Moreover, the LG allowed for a visual cross-referencing of life events where the interviewer was able to probe for theparticipant's perception of the interrelatedness of certain life events (HARRISONet al., 2011).<ref>"Researcher: Okay.Interviewee: I was living at my mother's home.Researcher: Oh I see.

[28]5. Practical Challenges and Possible SolutionsWe found the LG to be a flexible research tool that is useful in enhancing ourunderstanding of participant's experiences by facilitating discussion, buildingrapport and allowing cross-referencing of life events and comparisons betweenparticipants' accounts. However the LG approach is not without limitations. Onelimitation of retrospective research in general is related to the accuracy andreliability of the information provided by the participants. HARRISON et al. (2011)propose that "we have no way of evaluating to what extent the memoriesapproximated a true rendering of the experiences of these participants" (p.223).RICHARDSON et al. (2009) have also commented on this debate betweenrealism and constructionism and has argued for a middle-ground or pragmaticperspective. RICHARDSON et al. (ibid.) suggest that recall and reconstructionare interrelated concepts and that in qualitative research, the accuracy of therecalled information is less important than meaning and experience. In our studywe were not only interested in when life events occurred, but also the subjectiveexperiences and meanings of these life events, and how these events influencedand changed the lives of the participants. Given our focus on experiences (andwith concerns pertaining to recall in the back of our minds) we decided tointerview the mothers and adolescents while the adolescent was completinghis/her treatment at the rehabilitation centers. It is our experience that thisfacilitated recall as the participants were reflecting on current and fairly recentexperiences. [29]Furthermore researching sensitive issues, like those discussed in our study, is achallenging task which required us to identify methodologies that areappropriately sensitive while at the same time facilitative. Using the literature asour guide (see for example BUTLER & BAULD, 2005; USHER et al., 2007), weunderstood that talking about the adolescent's substance abuse would be adifficult task for both the mothers and the adolescents (especially to a "stranger").In this regard, we were cognizant of the possibility of selective recall whereparticipants are unable (or perhaps unwilling) to recall certain events, or showselective recall bias in favor of what is "easier" to discuss. Studies show thatindividuals have the tendency to forget information that they perceive self-threatening (for full discussions on these issues, please refer to GREEN,SEDIKIDES & GREGG, 2007; SAUNDERS, 2012). We therefore recognized thatparticipant recall, which was essential to obtain data that is information rich in ourstudy, was intrinsically dependent on our participants' abilities and willingness totell their stories. As put forth by BROWN and REAVY (2014) recall operates as ashared activity and in our study the LG acted as a quasi-neutral stimulus to theparticipants memories that accommodated the complexities of recall andFQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 16(3), Art. 24, Candice Groenewald & Arvin Bhana:Using the Lifegrid in Qualitative Interviews With Parents and Substance Abusing Adolescentsfacilitated discussions in a non-threatening and sensitive way and extended thestudy beyond the traditional 1:1 interview. [30]Some of the practical challenges (and solutions) we encountered with the LG arealso important to note here. Initially, the interviewer used a semi-structuredinterview guide that posed questions chronologically which, as discussed earlier,did not appropriately lend itself to the conversational and the non-linear way inwhich the participants recalled their experiences. It is our experience that aformative phase helps allay anxieties about the tool, but also serves to prime theparticipant in identifying key questions and life events categories, such asrelationships, school, work etc. that will be discussed in the LG interview. It mightalso be useful to identify possible life-events from the literature and incorporatethese in the LG interview. In some instances the participants thought that the LGwas a way for the interviewer to document aspects of the participants' lives ratherthan an activity to be co-completed by the participants and the interviewer. Oncethis was brought to the attention of the interviewer, she was able to explain in asmuch detail as needed that the LG is way to facilitate discussions. It is thereforeuseful for researchers to introduce the LG in such a way that the participants arenot distracted by the notion of providing the "right answer" but are comfortable todiscuss their experiences. [31]When using the LG with participant pairs (collateral informants) it is important forresearchers to be careful not to "take sides" when cross-referencing andcomparing events. In our study we respected that the participants' accountsreflected their subjective experiences and perspectives. We certainly recognizedthe significance of the participants' silences and selective recall as it tells ussomething about the significance of particular experiences. In cross-referencingor comparing events between the participant pairs we were less interested inwhose accounts were "right" or "wrong." Rather we found the LG useful in that itallowed us to use relevant information obtained from one participant (f.e., theadolescent) to probe for more detail from the other participant (f.e., the parent).This afforded us an opportunity to gain a more informed understanding of theparticipants' experiences and perspectives. [32]A further challenge relates to simultaneously conducting and analyzing the LGinterviews. Given the fluidity of the participants' conversations, it is important forthe interviewer to continually verbally note the dates (in days, months or years)that they are referring to when discussing the life events during the interview. Inour study for example, the interviewer sometimes neglected to record time anddate sequences which may conflate events in the coding of the transcripts. This isespecially imperative for researchers who are interested in tracking changes inlife-events and experiences.

ConclusionThis article describes the utility of the LG in qualitative inquiries. We found the LGapproach useful in helping explore the breadth and depth of events as we werenot only interested in when significant events occurred but also the participants'experiences of, and changes in, these selected areas of their lives. While the LGworked well in our study, it is advisable that researchers conduct a formativephase to establish key questions and life event categories so as to ensure thattheir research questions are appropriately addressed. The LG as a tool andapproach will be particularly valuable to qualitative researchers who areinterested in retrospectively exploring sensitive emotional events in thedevelopment of adolescent risk behaviors.
