I amgrateful to Emily Hauptman, Norbert Lechner andRuth A. Bevan for their comments on thatoccasion.4IHS Reihe Politikwissenschaft No. 15I.In this paper I address a problem of political theory that, while not new, hasbeen brought home with special urgency by recent events. The problem isthe predicament created by the imperative of coming to terms with thesubject of political possibility and the concomitant difficulty of doing so(Dunn 1980, 267,260). In the face of this quandary I pursue a basic intuition:in order to properly conceptualize political possibility we must recognizeand analyze the intimate relation of symbol and strategy in politics. In otherwords, in order to better understand the notion of political possibility wemust properly grasp its cultural dimensions. An example will perhaps lendsome, at least initial, plausibility to this intuition.The example is drawn from an interview, conducted in October 1982,with Bogdan Borusewisz, a Solidarity activist and underground leader. Earlyin the interview he harshly criticized the stance adopted by some Solidarityleaders during the period leading up to December 1981 when the Polishregime imposed marshal law.“There came a point when democratically elected activists lost allcontact with reality. And reality was more than Solidarity, more thanradical leaflets, and Radio Free Europe; it was the USSR, the army,and the security service, which we already knew in the autumn of 1980had drawn up a list of people to be interned (Lopinski, Moskit andWilk, 1990, 8).”In other words, Borusewisz was no wild utopian, intent on holding outfantastic alternatives. He was aware that political reality and possibility are,in crucial ways, distinguished by material considerations.In the same interview, however, Borusewisz reflects on the reasonswhy, during the days immediately after the regime imposed martial law, heand others thought it imperative to sustain the strike at the Lenin shipyard.“After all we had to defend a symbol; it wasn’t a question of theGdansk shipyard or the Repair Yard or even Gdansk itself but ofPoland as a whole. If we’d managed to draw out the strike in theshipyard it might have been possible to hold back the authorities on allfronts. On the other hand, I was certain that if the strike at theshipyard collapsed, the fact that a coal mine or steel works was onstrike wouldn’t have made any difference, because people think interms of symbols and would hang on as long as the shipyard hung on.That is why I tried desperately to defend the shipyard (Lopinski, Moskitand Wilk 1990, 30–31).”As this passage makes clear, Borusewisz and others recognized that, overa decade or so, Poles invested the Gdansk shipyard with specialsignificance. They had transformed the shipyard into a symbol, one thatenabled opponents of the regime to sustain an alternative vision of ‘Polandas a whole.’1 Consequently, it became a focal point in the strategic strugglebetween the opposition and the regime. Unlike strikes elsewhere, the one atthe shipyard, according to Borusewisz, symbolized the possibility, howeverfleeting, that Poles might resist marshal law. Ultimately, Solidarity could not1 I take Solidarity to be a paradigmatic antipolitical movement (Ost 1990). The shipyard isamong the central symbols in the “tradition of resistance” that Polish workers firstconstructed and then extended to other portions of society (Laba 1991).5Johnson The Politics of Possibilitysustain the strike at the shipyard. And although other strikes continued, thecollapse of the strike there rendered the possibility of widespread, overtresistance inconceivable.This example is intended to suggest how intimately connected symbol andstrategy are in social and political life, and how they are related in ways thatdirectly effect our capacity to envision political possibilities. My aim in thispaper is to explore, and hopefully clarify, these claims in a preliminary way.The remainder of the paper consists of six sections. In sections twoand three I draw and hopefully make clear a crucial distinction between theways that the ability to calculate probabilities and to entertain possibilitiesenter into social and political interaction. And I argue that the latter capacityis governed by the force of prevailing symbolic forms. In section four Iidentify the mechanisms at work in the ways symbolic forms govern ourability to envision possibilities. In section five I address the ways thatpolitical possibility is implicated with power. In section six I sketch some ofthe constraints and vicissitudes that render the politics of possibility adifficult and precarious undertaking. In section seven I briefly connect myargument to the theme of antipolitics.II.“What is politically possible depends in part on what men believe” (Dunn1980, 260).2 This is no doubt so. But it also is too quick. I put to one sidefor the moment matters of material or physical constraint. In this section Iargue that the scope of political possibility is, in the most basic,theoretically important sense constituted not by beliefs or expectations perse, but by the range of things (e.g., actors, events, outcomes) concerningwhich relevant agents can hold beliefs or establish expectations. Hereagain, perhaps an example will help.In his Antipolitics, a book largely devoted to envisioning a possiblepost-Yalta political framework, George Konrad reflected on, among otherthings, the prevailing uncoordinated, largely individualistic strategy ofopposition in Hungary. He explained that:“We Hungarians never created our own KOR or Solidarity, because wedidn’t really believe that communist power could be reconciled withdemocratic institutions born of society’s aspirations of self-determination. We saw what our Polish friends were doing; we wantedthem to succeed, but doubted that they could (Konrad 1984, 129–30).”This is a straightforward estimation of probabilities. Oppositional elementsin Hungary, according to Konrad, had no difficulty envisioning collectivepolitical strategies such as those adopted by KOR or Solidarity. Theysimply believed that such strategies held out a very low probability ofsuccess.Consider, by contrast, the emergence of radically unanticipated actorsonto the political stage. When I say that such actors are radicallyunanticipated I mean that ex ante their appearance as political actors wasnot just unforeseen but unforeseeable. Here we might include, for instance,the way that the British working classes intruded into politics under theaegis of Chartism in the late 1830’s. Or, more recently, and perhaps of2 Dunn himself is concerned with grounding the notion of political obligation in a generalconception of what in different times and places is political possible. He does notsystematically explore the notion of political possibility.6IHS Reihe Politikwissenschaft No. 15greater relevance to the topic of antipolitics, we might we might include theway mothers infiltrated Argentine politics in the late 1970’s. In suchinstances the very incongruity of such actors engaging in politics – asworkers, or as mothers – scrambles established political categories and,thereby redefines the realm of possibility.3 In the latter case, for a period oftime this incongruity prevented the Argentine Junta from recognizing theMothers of the Plaza de Mayo as political actors in any relevant sense.Within the political categories to which the junta, like the rest of Argentinesociety, subscribed, “mothers were not perceived as political subjects.” TheMothers of the Plaza, as a result, were enshrouded by a “politicalinvisibility” that afforded them a strategically crucial, if temporary, advantageover the junta.4 This was a matter not of probability but of possibility or, forlack of a better word, worldview. During the early months of the Mother’sweekly demonstrations in the Plaza de Mayo, the junta literally did notunderstand the political nature of the protests. Such activity transgressedthe boundaries of their political world. It simply was not possible for mothersto engage in politics.5 By the time the junta reconfigured their conception ofpolitical possibility so that they could recognize the Mothers as politicalactors, and take repressive measures, it was too late. The Mothers of thePlaza already had come to symbolize, both domestically and in theinternational arena, the possibility of open resistance to the Argentineregime.A worldview amounts to a basic understanding of how the worldoperates, of the sorts of entities (actors, events, outcomes) it contains.Among the components of a worldview is a more or less systematic “folkpsychology,” a general conception of persons and a corresponding set ofexpectations about how they typically behave.6 In the present paper I focusexclusively on this dimension of political possibility – the types of politicalsubject that relevant actors can hold beliefs or develop expectations about.III.It is important to distinguish, then, between the different ways that thecalculation of probabilities and the consideration of possibilities informpolitical action.7 And it is important to see how the latter trades upon the3 Dorothy Thompson (1984, 11–12) captures the in congruity of workers entering thepolitical of early nineteenth century Britain in the following way. “In the 1830’s the goodself-respecting workman did not mix in politics. ... When HM Inspector of Prisons interviewedthe men in prison for Chartist activ ities in 1840, he spoke approvingly of the decision somehad made to ‘give up politics.’ It did not occur to him that former Chartists should becomeWhigs or Tories. Politics in any form was not the business of the working man.”4 I draw the quoted phrases from Navarro (1989, 257).5 Hence the practice of the junta of referring to the Mothers as the “madwomen” of thePlaza.6 On this point see generally Geertz (1983, 55–70) and Bruner (1990, 13–14,35,42–3,47,52).7 “There is a fundamental difference between a situation in which a decision maker isuncertain about the state of X and a situation in which the decision maker has not given anythought to whether X matters or not, between a situation in which a prethought event judgedof low probability occurs and a situation in which something occurs that has never beenthought about, between judging an action unlikely to succeed and never thinking about anaction. The latter situations in each pair are not adequately modeled in terms of lowprobabilities” (Nelson and Winter, 1982, 67).7Johnson The Politics of Possibilityintimate relation of symbol and strategy in politics. All of this will perhapsemerge more clearly if we examine attempts to depict the world solely interms of the calculation of probabilities.Consider, in this respect, the austere, counterfactual world thatrational choice theorists construct. Samuel Popkin’s The Rational Peasantsupplies a particularly instructive example. Early on, Popkin proclaims thathe will advance an exclusively rational choice analysis of Vietnamesepeasant politics and that, in so doing, he will treat cultural considerationsas “givens” (Popkin 1979, 82). He aims to explain peasant politics solely interms of the peasants’ self-interest and their estimates of the likelihood thatthose interests can be realized. Toward the end of the book, however,Popkin reflects briefly on the decisive role that he attributes to “politicalentrepreneurs” in facilitating collective action among peasants (Popkin1979, 259–66). He suggests that the success or failure of these leadersdepended crucially on their competence and credibility. But, somewhatsurprisingly, Popkin insists that their credibility derived from “culturalbases.” He attributes the variable success of religious and politicalentrepreneurs over time to their differential ability “to utilize cultural themes”,to orchestrate “terms and symbols,” that resonated with their potentialconstituents (Popkin, 1979, 260–61). In short, political entrepreneursengender and sustain credibility through symbolic action. They seek tocoordinate and mobilize relevant constituencies by more or less skillfullydeploying symbolic forms that have force over them.I will return to Popkin shortly. But now consider a second theoreticalexample, one much closer to the “core” of the rational choice researchtradition. Here I have in mind the ways that, like Popkin, non-cooperativegame theorists tacitly incorporate symbolic considerations into theirpurportedly purely strategic models. For present purposes I will consideronly one of the ways they do so.8Game theorists tacitly incorporate symbolic force into their standardprocedure for transforming games of incomplete information into equivalentbut technically more tractable games of complete but imperfect information.This procedure is complex.9 Simply put, it reduces, for analytical purposes,all forms of uncertainty to mutual uncertainty about the payoff functionscharacteristic of players in the game. All players in the game then constructconditional probabilities over the “types” of other player that they mightencounter based on an initial objective distribution that game theoriststypically attribute to “nature.”Symbol and strategy intersect here because, as game theoriststypically do not recognize, “types” are not natural categories.“The everyday world in which members of any community move, theirtaken for granted field of social action, is populated not by anybodies,faceless men without qualities, but by somebodies, concrete classesof determinant persons positively characterized and appropriatelylabeled. And the symbol systems which define these classes are notgiven in the nature of things – they are historically constructed,socially maintained and individually applied (Geertz 1973, 363–64).”8 A more obvious example is the way that Schelling (1960) invokes the “symbolic contentsof the game” in order to explain how problems of multiple equilibria are resolved in strategicsettings. This remains the standard resolution t o this endemic problem even among morehighly technical game theorists (Kreps 1990, 101; Myerson 1992).9 For a survey see Myerson (1985, 231–42).8IHS Reihe Politikwissenschaft No. 15The range of possible “types” in any population is marked and interpretedsymbolically. Thus, for example, recalling the revolutionary events of Parisin 1848, Tocqueville reports repeated encounters with “workers,” whom hereadily identifies by their “blouses, which, as we all know, are their fightingas well as their working clothes” (Tocqueville 1987, 142 stress added).10Here clothing operates as a symbolic marker, allowing Tocqueville torecognize the types of actors he encounters and, thereby, to navigateperilous, highly indeterminant political circumstances.Return now to Popkin. On his account, the political entrepreneurs whosought to coordinate the collective action among the Vietnamese peasantryencountered the daunting prior problem of projecting comprehensible,credible “visions of the future” (Popkin 1988, 61–62; 1979, 261). Thisrequired that they recast a political world populated by “rational peasants”into one in which other “types” – specifically credible, committedentrepreneurs – were genuinely possible. And it required articulating thispossibility in “terms and symbols” that had force for relevant constituencies.Popkin argues that Communist organizers did not enjoy successcomparable to that of religious leaders until they learned to articulate theirvision of the future in indigenous cultural idioms. Prior to that point“[p]easants did not understand why organizers were offering to help themand were reluctant to join with them for even small local projects” (Popkin1988, 62 stress added; 1979, 261). Their world was symbolicallyconstituted in such a way that it could not accommodate the entrepreneurs’“type” as a genuine possibility. It thereby foreclosed the very possibility ofcooperative collective action.IV.Consider the following remark that Jürgen Habermas once made in thecourse of a discussion of utopia.“In specific historical moments, where we can recognize a real socialmovement, real historical struggles, we also become aware thatpeople do not fight for abstractions – despite the three great andineradicable goals of the French Revolution. People do not fight forabstractions, but with images. Banners, symbols, rhetorical speech,allegorical speech, utopia-inspired speech, in which concrete goals areconjured up before people’s eyes, are indeed necessary constituentsof movements which have any effect on history at all (Habermas, 1986,145–6).”10 For further references to the “blouses” of workers, see Tocqueville (1987, 117,130,145).Tocqueville also intimates that workers were adept at interpreting the attire of other classes.For instance, during the June days he and Corcelle, a fellow delegate to the National Assembly,undertook something of a reconnaissance mission through the streets of Paris. He relates oneof Corcelle’s adventures in the following terms. “He told me afterwards that, having firstpassed several half-constructed barricades without obstruction, he was halted at the last one;the workers building it, seeing a fine gentleman in a black suit with clean white linen quietlywalking around the dirty streets by the Hotel de Ville and stopping in front of them with aplacid air of curiosity, decided to make some use of this suspicious onlooker. They asked himin the name of fraternity to help them in their work. Corcelle ... in the circumstances ...rightly thought it best to yield without a fuss. So there he was levering up the pavement andputting the stones on top of one another as tidily as he could. His natural clumsiness and hiswandering thoughts luckily came to his aid, and he was soon dismissed as a useless laborer”(Tocqueville 1987, 139 stress added).9Johnson The Politics of PossibilityI agree. In fact, I would suggest that this remark is relevant not just toremarkable episodes, but, to political action and interaction more generally.Habermas, nonetheless leaves open at least two especially pressingsets of theoretical questions. First, if as Bogdan Borusewisz noted in myinitial example, ‘people think in terms of symbols,’ how are we tounderstand this process. In other words, why do political actors, whetherindividual or collective, indeed fight “with” symbols? What sort of force dosymbols have that make them effective resources in political struggle? And,second, how are we to understand the dynamics of such symboliccontests? How do we specify the character of symbolic action? I addressthe first set of question in this section and the second set in the nextsection.Cultures consist of intersubjectively shared symbols which actorsinvest with meaning and deploy in ritual, tradition and other culturalperformances. It is a sort of “symbolic strategy for encompassingsituations,” for imposing conceptual order on otherwise indeterminantprocesses of interaction (Geertz 1973, 250,230,89; Ortner 1984, 129).11On this view: “Symbols instigate social action” (Turner 1974, 55). However,they do so, as I now argue, only indirectly. To see why, it is necessary tounderstand how symbols work. This, in turn, requires that we distinguish foranalytical purposes the “scope” of symbolic forms from their “force.”The scope of a symbol or cultural performance refers to “the range ofsocial contexts within which” relevant actors regard it “as having more orless direct relevance.” Its force refers to its “centrality or marginality” in thelives of relevant actors, to the “psychological grip” it exercises over them(Geertz, 1968, 111–113). The efficacy of a set of symbolic forms clearlydepends on the scope that actors attribute to it. This accounts for thepropensity of oppositional social and political movements, for example, togenerate elaborate, encompassing “alternative cultures.”12 Yet force takesanalytical priority over scope. Any claim regarding the scope of a particularsymbol or practice presupposes that it has force. Absent such force itwouldn’t be relevant to any social context.The force of symbolic forms is at bottom cognitive or conceptual(Lukes 1977, 68f). Symbolic forms, orchestrated in cultural performances ofvarious sorts, “structure the way people think about social life” (Moore andMyerhoff 1977, 4).13 They serve as “extrinsic sources of information”(Geertz 1973, 92) not in the sense that they convey detailed messages, butin a broader sense of imparting a view of how the world actually is – how itoperates and how individuals can be expected to act within it. Symbolic11 On this view, culture consists of “a system of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolicforms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate and develop their knowledge aboutand attitudes toward life.” And a symbol is “any object, act, event, quality, or relation whichserves as a vehicle for a conception – the conception being the symbol’s ‘meaning’ ” (Geertz1973, 89,91,10). On the career of this concept of culture see Ortner (1984) and Barth (1989).12 This was true, for example, of British Chartists in the 1830’s and 1840’s, of Americanpopulism in the 1890’s, of the turn of the century German labor movement, and of ItalianCommunists in the 1970’s.13 This obviously presumes something about the way we think. But it does not entailpsychological reductionism. Rather, it presumes an “extrinsic theory” of mind in which diversehuman mental functions – cognition, emotions, dispositions, etc. – all essentially depend uponthe availability of sets of symbolic forms (Geertz 1973, 215,45–6,76f,360f). Thus, aspsychologist Jerome Bruner (1986, 15) contends, “a cultural tool kit – a set of prostheticdevices, so to speak” is essential to the full flourishing of “human mental activity.” See alsoWittgenstin (1967, para. 605–7).10IHS Reihe Politikwissenschaft No. 15forms, then, do not directly instill beliefs or values. Rather, they establishthe focal categories of social and political interaction and, thereby, establishparameters on belief formation. Symbolic forms help delineate – in at leasttwo empirically intertwined but analytically distinguishable ways – the realmof social and political possibility for relevant actors.In the first place, symbolic forms operate indicatively to focus theattention of actors, directing it toward certain ranges of alternatives andaway from others.14 They assert order, relation and predictability in the faceof indeterminacy (Moore and Myerhoff, 1977, 18). They foreclosepossibilities. This process is not naive. Symbolic force discriminates. Bycalling attention to certain options, thereby defining them as viable orfeasible, it forecloses other options. It constitutes social and politicalinteractions on particular, partial terms (Lukes 1977, 68–9; Elkins andSimeon 1979, 128; Kertzer 1988, 87).If symbolic forms only operated indicatively they would have anunvaryingly constraining, conservative impact on social and politicalinteraction. But symbols also operate subjunctively to disclose possibilitiesoften not immediately discernable in mundane existence. They thus openoptions that might go otherwise unconsidered (Bruner 1986, 26,159; Turner1987, 26–7,41–42,101). Orchestrated in cultural performances such asritual, for example, symbolic forms give palpable existence to as yetunrealized possibility.15 They nourish the imagination of social and politicalactors, helping to “render the world less fixed, less banal, more susceptibleto recreation” (Bruner, 1986, 159). Thus, this process is not naive either. Byimaginatively disclosing and exploring possibilities actors can, within limits,redefine their options.Symbolic forms, then, exert force over social and political actors bycommanding their attention and capturing their imagination. They govern themental capacities with which actors delimit the possibilities embodied intheir extant situation and envision those that lie beyond it. So understood,the force of symbolic forms grounds the intimate relation between symboland strategy in politics.V.Symbolic forms govern prevailing conceptions of possibility. They are, inCharles Taylor (1985) terms, “constitutive” of practices and institutions.This, however, leaves us on an ambiguous theoretical terrain. On the onehand, possibility is not defined purely by structural causes.16 The notion ofpolitical possibility, in particular, presumes that actors intentionally anddeliberately endeavor to constitute the world in particular ways (Elster 1978,48–49). On the other hand, constituting or reconstituting the social andpolitical world, disclosing or foreclosing possibilities, does not involveselecting or rejecting discrete, pre-defined alternatives. It is not, strictly14 Stinchcombe suggests that attention is “the key link between individuals and culturalsystems.” The force of symbolic forms on his view resides in part in their capacity to establish“attention structures” that provide common foci of choice and interaction (Stinchcombe1968, 247,235–36). Thus, as Elkins and Simeon (1979, 142,127–28,131,139) put the point:“Culture is unlikely to be of much help in explaining why alternative A was chosen overalternative B – but it may be of great help in understanding why A and B were considered,while no thought was given to C, D, or E.”15 “In ritual,” for example, “the world as lived and the world as imagined, fused under theagency of a single set of symbolic forms, turn out to be the same world” (Geertz, 1973, 112).16 Even if it obviously is subject to physical and material constraints (Follesdal 1981).11Johnson The Politics of Possibilityspeaking, a matter of choice (Follesdal 1981, 402). Rather, it is a matter ofthe ways political actors seek, for strategic purposes, to exploit the forcethat symbolic forms hold for relevant constituencies. How are we tounderstand the character of such symbolic action?In the first place, symbolic action consists largely in the efforts toinvest a symbolic form or cultural performance with particular, partialmeaning. Relevant constituencies share symbols and the culturalperformances in which they are orchestrated insofar as they mutuallyattribute significance to that set. However, the meanings that individuals orgroups within the population attribute to the symbolic components of theirculture need not be shared. Symbolic forms, not the imperfectly shared,occasionally idiosyncratic, frequently contested meanings attributed tothem, constitute the crucial intersubjective, public dimension of culture.Meanings can be shared, more or less imperfectly, within a populationor they can verge on the idiosyncratic. Indeed political acumen is properlyconceived less as the capacity to invent new symbols than as the ability tocreatively recast meanings invested in existing symbolic forms (Walzer1967, 196). Anyone attempting such semantic improvisation necessarily willchallenge the established meanings attributed to a symbol. And they quitepossibly will confront discordant improvisations crafted by others. Symbolicforms do not simply express meaning. They enable social and politicalactors to make, remake and, in the process, contest meanings (Cohen1985, 15).17Second, as should now be clear, symbolic action is conflictual. Tocquevillebrings this point home with especial force in one well known episode that herecounts in his Recollections. There he recalls as follows the opening inearly May 1848 of the new Constituent Assembly to which he was anelected delegate.“I should be able to call to mind the look of that Assembly at itsopening, but I find that my recollection is very blurred. . . . I canremember only our shouting “Long Live the Republic!” fifteen times inthe course of the session in competition with one another. . . . I thinkthat cry was sincere on both sides, but it stood for different, evencontradictory thoughts. Everybody wanted to preserve the Republic,but some wanted to use it for attack, and others to defend themselves(Tocqueville, 1987, p. 99).”Tocqueville was not a disinterested observer of this scene. Despite hispartisanship he grants that the political factions contesting the meaning of‘the Republic’ were sincere.18 Delegates of the contending parties were notduplicitous; they actually interpreted ‘the Republic’ and the possibilitiesembodied in the political world in different, conflicting ways.17 This line of argument has a contentious implication. It suggests that we shift theoreticalattention away from a Durkheimian inspired preoccupation with culture as a medium ofintegration and instead think of symbolic forms as devices for aggregating meanings (Cohen,1985, 20,21). Cultural symbols do not express value consensus or shared belief (Laitin 1988).Indeed, symbolic forms do not so much represent or express pre-existing values and beliefs asconstitute the context within which individuals formulate beliefs and values. They helpstructure belief (Cohen 1979, 98; Kertzer 1988, 68).18 On republican symbolism during this period in France see Agulhon (1981).12IHS Reihe Politikwissenschaft No. 15Contests of this sort are essentially strategic, part of what Geertz(1973, 316) calls “the struggle for the real.”19 Actors engaged in suchstrategic contests seek, with differential facility and success, to exploitsymbolic force in order to define the context of their ongoing interactions.Their objective is to establish as authoritative a particular and partialconception of the world and the social and political possibilities it contains.In the struggle for the real actors strive to command the attention andcapture the imagination of relevant others by directing the symbolic mediawith which they think.Third, the struggle for the real is pervasive and inescapable. It takesplace across a range of arenas. For example, delegates who Tocquevilledescribes mounted their struggle at center stage, publicly contesting therange of possibilities contained in ‘the Republic’. By contrast, peasantsengaging in everyday forms of resistance are effective precisely becausethey do not assail the public stage. They “typically avoid any directsymbolic confrontation with authority.” At a more mundane, local level,however, they too are engaged in a contest of interpretations, “a struggleover the appropriation of symbols . . . over how the past and present shouldbe understood and labeled” (Scott 1985, xvi, xvii, 27, 178).The struggle for the real is inescapable, it is not a contingent aspect ofsymbolic action. Actors have both the occasion and an incentive to takepart. Cultures afford ample opportunity for symbolic contests. Because theyare, by definition, multivocal, symbolic forms obviously invite discordantinterpretation. Moreover, “cultural systems” are not seamless.20 Theinterstices that they inevitably contain provide openings for semanticimprovisation. Symbolic forms also establish a powerful incentive to engagein the struggle for the real. They do not influence thought or actiondeterministically by directly instilling individual values, beliefs orpreferences.21 Symbolic force does however circumscribe the range ofpossibilities over which actors might establish values, preferences, orbeliefs. Moreover, symbolic force discriminates. It can focus attention oncertain options thereby diverting attention from others and circumscribingpossibility. It also can slacken the constraints of attention by sustainingunrealized options in imagination. In this way it can hold out as viable orfeasible options that otherwise would not enter into consideration. In theseways symbolic force sustains particular conceptions of political possibilityat the expense of others.22The struggle for the real occupies the nexus of symbol and strategy.What is at stake in this struggle are political possibilities and the symbolicforms that govern how actors entertain them. The struggle for the real, then,19 When speaking of symbolic action anthropologists regularly use metaphors of“management”, “strategy ”, “bargaining” and “negotiation.” For examples and discussion seeJohnson (1991). Metaphors are not merely literary embellishments. They structure social andpolitical inquiry. The metaphors that interpretive theorists deploy provide warrant forpursuing the unexamined strategic dimensions of “symbolic action.”20 The extent of their internal coherence and interconnectedness is an empirical question(Geertz, 1973, 18,406–407; Turner 1974, 163). It is very important not to prejudge theextent of this internal coherence (Barth 1989).21 Implicitly I am taking sides in a recent theoretical debate concerning cultural explanation.Symbolic force operates in the first instance to establish the focal categories of politicalinteraction (Laitin 1988; Myerson, 1992) rather than to define values or preferences(Wildavsky 1987;1988;1992).22 Walzer (1967, 195–96); Lukes (1977, 68); Elkins and Simeon (1979, 128); Kertzer (1988,87).13Johnson The Politics of Possibilityis a struggle over power. In seeing how this is so, we can also identifysome of the vicissitudes and constraints to which participants in thisstruggle are subject.VI.The struggle for the real is a struggle over possibility. It is a struggle forpower. More precisely, it is a struggle for power over others, a contest tocontrol the media, the symbols and cultural performances, in terms of whichsocial and political actors conceive possibilities and fashion them into viablealternatives. The intimate relation of symbol and strategy in politics pivotsaround possibility, feasibility and power.Recall that the notion of political possibility presupposes that agentsintentionally and deliberately seek to constitute the world in particular ways.Intentional action is the product of “two successive filtering devices” (Elster,1979, 113, 77). The first filter specifies the “feasible set” by circumscribingthe range of abstractly possible alternatives. The feasible set, then,consists of those options genuinely available to actors. The second filter isthe process through which actors choose from among the options in thefeasible set.Strategic actors regularly contest the context of their interactions –including the prevailing set of feasible options that it makes available(Schelling 1960). Moreover, what often is at stake in such contests are thesymbolic media through which others envision possibilities and identifysome subset of conceivable options as feasible.“After all, options are not just opened or closed. They are essentiallyseen to be open or closed, and crucially seen so under particulardescriptions, descriptions that can themselves motivate or inhibitaction. . . . What one cannot envisage is difficult to choose (Rorty,1988, 337–38).”In any situation the “feasible” as distinct from “merely conceivable” optionsare a function of what actors consider “obvious,” what they “take for granted”and there is no general criterion for differentiating genuinely feasible fromabstractly possible options (Schwartz 1986, 224–228). The way thisdistinction is drawn in particular settings is a question of power.Power is a relational concept. When agents exercise power theynecessarily exercise it over others. In particular, they aim to define the setof feasible options that others consider when determining how to act.23Thus, power differs from persuasion which aims to modify how othersevaluate alternatives. It does not directly alter another’s preferences orbeliefs regarding available options. Similarly, power differs from force whichaims to eliminate choice on the part of those subjected to it by physicallynarrowing their feasible set to a single option. Power need not involvephysical constraint. It aims to influence the way others to choose aparticular course of action by modifying the alternatives available to them.Power can work by altering the incentive structure that actors face. Itconsists, in such instances, of negative or positive inducements, threats oroffers. But power need not involve such inducements at all. Indeed, actorscan exercise power in strategic situations simply by credibly leading othersto expect that they will choose a particular course of action (Taylor 1982,23 The discussion in this paragraph is indebted to the typology presented by Taylor (1982,10–25).14IHS Reihe Politikwissenschaft No. 1512–13,145). Actors who can successfully coordinate the expectations of arelevant constituency often can generate the sort of collective action neededto sustain selective inducements in the first place (Hardin 1990, 363,366–69).Coordination, however, is typically as much a matter of expectationsas incentives. Strategic actors can mutually coordinate their expectationsonly by focusing attention on one among a range of alternatives. They mustcreate a “focal point” by endowing that option with prominence and this, inany given instance, typically is a product of “imagination” (Schelling 1960,58). Strategic actors create focal points through symbolic action. Theyinvest seemingly extra-strategic particularities with significance, therebytransforming them into symbols whose force coordinates social and politicalinteraction.24 They exercise power over others by symbolically structuringtheir expectations. Power in this sense, operates “along the cognitivedimension” (Lukes 1977, 68; Turner 1974, 134).Power may be malign. “It might be said that the main function of asystem of domination is” to foreclose options, “to define what is realisticand what is not realistic and to drive certain goals and aspirations into therealm of the impossible, the realm of idle dreams, of wishful thinking” (Scott1985, 326). Symbolically constituted attention structures can be highlyinhibiting. They foreclose possibilities By defining alternatives to existingarrangements as infeasible such attention structures can preventsubordinate actors from recognizing, much less pursuing a range ofpossibilities. On the other hand, even oppositional groups need tocircumscribe possibilities.25 They rely on attention structures to coordinatetheir activities and potentially to divert more powerful groups. This isprecisely the strategy that the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, for example,adopted when they both occupied the symbolic center of Argentine politics(the Plaza from which they took their name) and did so as mothers.Disclosing possibilities is a similarly equivocal process. Contesting thebounds of political possibility crucially presumes that actors can imaginealternatives precluded by extant definitions of the political world.Subordinate actors are adept at this sort of symbolic action. In particular,they demonstrate a remarkable propensity to symbolically reverse (andthereby expose the conventional character of) prevailing social and politicalarrangements (Scott 1985, 331). But if such symbolic action is pervasive, italso underscores the observation that “in matters of social constitution thefield of possibilities is much wider than the people within each societyimagine” (Tocqueville 1987, 76).26 Symbolic reversals often are little more24 In strategic situations not just incentive structures but “the aesthetic properties, thehistorical properties, the legal and moral properties, the cultural properties, and all the othersuggestive and connotative details, can serve to focus the expectations of certain participantson certain solutions” (Schelling 1960, 113).25 Circumstances in which “all is possible” are extraordinary. They are fleeting at best. Thetelling characterization of such circumstances as “moments of madness” (Zolberg 1972)specifies precisely the sorts of conceptual constraint that prevents participants fromsustaining them.26 This sort of constrained imagination is not characteristic solely of symbolic reversals. “Atthis moment several countries in Eastern Europe . . . have or about to venture into thegreatest experiment in history since t he forced Stalinist industrialization of 1929. . . . theeconomic transformations envisaged in these countries ironically mirror the Communistproject. . . . They are radical: They are intended to turn upside down all the existing socialrelations. And they offer a single panacea, which once waved will cure all ills. Replace‘nationalization of the means of production’ by ‘private property’ and ‘plan’ by ‘market’ and15Johnson The Politics of Possibilitythan that. They do not so much project an alternative set of arrangementsas, by reversing existing relations of dependency, inequity or injustice,depict and promote their opposite (Hirschman 1982, 95; Rorty 1988 338).Actors who imaginatively explore unrealized possibilities confrontserious hazards even if they manage to transcend this sort of ubiquitousconstraint. Most obviously they might intentionally disregard or otherwiseneglect pragmatic or material constraints (Follesdal 1981). Thinking back tothe example with which I opened the paper, the symbolic power thatSolidarity could command was dramatically inadequate in the face of theoverwhelming military force that the regime mustered. Thus, in the spring of1982, one Polish worker lamented: “We’ve got all the symbols, and they’vegot all the guns and tanks.”27 Actors who neglect such material constraintsdivert energy and resources into “futile exercises,” flights of fancy that atbest are compensatory. They encourage fantasy or utopian thinking in thepejorative sense (Rorty 1988, 341).28Political actors face additional risks even where they pursue “genuine”possibilities, alternatives that are viable in the sense of being broadlyconsonant with pragmatic or material constraints. They might simply fail torealize possible objectives. As with all intentional action, a gap alwayslooms between attempt and accomplishment. Conversely, having realizedalternative possibilities, relevant actors might encounter a significant gapbetween the reality achieved and the possibility held out. Either eventualitycan breed disappointment and resignation (Hirschman 1982, 94; Rorty1988, 338). Either eventuality, may, in that sense, reinforce the sense ofinevitability that enshrouds the extant political world.VII.The argument of this paper has been circuitous. I have argued that grapplingwith the subject of political possibility requires that we examine the intimaterelation of symbol and strategy in politics. I have drawn a crucial distinctionbetween the ways that the ability to calculate probabilities and to entertainpossibilities enters into social and political interaction. I have identified themechanisms – attention and imagination – at work in the ways symbolicforms govern our ability to envision possibilities. I have shown how politicalpossibility is implicated with power. And I have sketched some of theconstraints and vicissitudes that make the politics of possibility aprecarious enterprise. I now want briefly to connect my preceding argumentto the theme of antipolitics. I will make three short assertions.1. Antipolitics, whether conducted by formally organized collectiveentities like Solidarity or by looser groupings of individuals like the Mothersof the Plaza, is implicated in the politics of possibility. Parties to antipoliticsdeploy symbolic forms with greater or lesser facility and success and theydo so for strategic purposes. They aim to redefine the political world byrecasting the bounds of political possibility in particular and partial ways.you can leave the structure of the ideology intact. Perhaps revolutions are shaped by the verysystems against which they are directed?” (Przeworski 1991, 7).27 Reported by Laba (1991, 148).28 This discussion minimally requires that we differentiate imagination from fantasy.Imagination is concerned with fashioning genuine, viable, if unrealized, alternatives. Fantasyinclines toward the “merely possible,” toward options that, while conceivable, remain“incredible” and consequently unrealizable (Rorty 1988, 340–41; Wittgenstin 1967, para.275).16IHS Reihe Politikwissenschaft No. 152. Antipolitics, insofar as it is concerned with possibilities, is a strategy inthe struggle for power. This may seem peculiar given the aversion ofspokesmen like Konrad to power politics. He claims that the “medium ofpolitics is power over people – power backed by weapons” (Konrad 1984,16). And he asserts that “No thinking person should want to drive othersfrom positions of political power in order to occupy them himself” (Konrad1984, 119). Yet since antipolitics of the sort in which Solidarity or theMothers of the Plaza engage entails participation in the “struggle for thereal”, this suspicion of power is simply misplaced.293. It is easy to find pessimists, those who view the struggle for the realand the efforts to redefine political possibility that it entails as inherentlydangerous. But it is not easy to find alternatives. In politics symbol andstrategy are related in inescapable ways. So, for example, the invention oftraditions is a pervasive strategic move in politics.30 But observers ofpolitics in post-communist East Central Europe typically express suspicionof political actors who invoke tradition (Gyani 1993; Jaworski 1985). Theyrarely consider whether, in such highly indeterminant politicalcircumstances, it might be possible to invent normatively appealingtraditions. I have in mind here, for instance, a tradition of constitutionalism(Johnson 1994). We must, as the brochure for this conference suggests, bewary of antipolitical mobilizations that threaten to derail the emergence orstability of liberal democratic political arrangements. However, the mosteffective response to such mobilizations is to engage in the politics ofpossibility. And this means recognizing the need to effectively exercise thepower that emerges at the intersection of symbol and strategy.29 It may be more appropriate to say that Konrad really is opposed to force as a finalguarantor of political arrangements. But we should not let his invocation of “spiritualauthority” or “moral opposition” (Konrad 1984, 119,122) blind us to the fact thatantipolitics is part of the “struggle for the real” and hence is a struggle for power. BothSolidarity and the Mothers of the Plaza invoked spiritual authority in the face of authoritarianrule. But they did so in hopes of expanding the range of political possibilities beyond thosesanctioned by extant political arrangements.30 Compare Hobsbawm and Ranger (1983) and Schelling (1960).17Johnson The Politics of PossibilityReferencesAgulhon, Maurice. 1981.
