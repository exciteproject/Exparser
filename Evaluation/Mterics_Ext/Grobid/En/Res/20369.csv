Cost-effectiveness .Economic evaluation . TransferabilityBackgroundThe results of health economic evaluations are of growinginterest to political decision makers and insurance pro-viders, not least because of increasingly tight budgets in thehealth care sector. To meet this new interest, clinical trialsare increasingly taking into account resource and costparameters (Drummond et al. 1997). In Germany economicaspects are becoming more important in the assessment of328new therapies. Moreover, numerous methodological stand-ards have been developed in recent years, which aim toensure that the results of clinical studies are less open tobias. In addition, regulatory authorities tend to favourdesigns in which at least a minority of subjects in trialshave been recruited in the host country, although theyremain generally content with the fact that only a minorityof subjects may actually be drawn from their country. Thus,international multicentre study designs have become a keycomponent of clinical trial programmes (Demol andWeihrauch 1997).Multinational studies have numerous advantages oversingle-nation studies. In particular, the large geographicalareas involved allow investigators to recruit sizable numbersof patients in a relatively short period of time, and the qualityof evidence may be improved by virtue of regional variationsin the patient mix (Manca and Willan 2006; Sculpher et al.2004; Drummond and Pang 2001). Multinational studies alsohave important caveats. Chief among these is the difficultyof transferring study findings to the level of individualnational health care systems. After all, national decisionmakers are primarily interested in the results a study wouldhave yielded if it had been conducted in their ownjurisdiction.Clinical trials are normally designed on the assumptionof a common treatment effect across different strata, forexample by centre or by country. It is well understood thatpatient characteristics and thus the absolute effects oftreatment may vary between centres, and it is common touse some form of stratified randomisation to ensure anapproximate balance of treatment and control subjectswithin centres or regions. The analysis of clinical trialsusually involves some degree of examination of subgroups,although the aim is normally to support the assumption thatthere is a single treatment effect, and there is considerablecontroversy when it becomes apparent that this assumptionmay not be supported (Reed et al. 2005). The question oftransferability becomes very apparent, however, when weconsider economic parameters, for these—in contrast toclinical outcomes—are subject to considerable country-specific variability (Asplund et al. 2003; Jönsson andWeinstein 1997; Drummond and Pang 2001). Despiterecent efforts to develop methodological standards fordealing with the resulting uncertainties, it is surprising tosee that economic analyses are still being conductedwithout paying consideration to the issues raised whentransferring the findings of multinational studies to nationalsettings (Halliday and Darba 2003).According to the most recent German health care reformact from April 2007, the Institute for Quality and Efficiencyin Health Care (IQWiG) can be assigned to evaluate notonly the effects of a medical intervention according tointernational standards of evidence-based medicine, butJ Public Health (2010) 18:327–335also the balance between benefits in the national health caresetting according to international standards of healtheconomics. In this context the question of transferring oradopting the findings of multinational trials to an actualnational context will be a question of the methodologicalframework the IQWiG is currently about to implement.ObjectivesThe present analysis summarises several of the mostcommon international methods for generating health eco-nomic assessments based on clinical studies from differentsettings; it also provides an overview of potential newapproaches to this subject from the perspective of Germany.In recent years, the problem of transferability has becomeincreasingly important in this country. These developmentsraise the question of the extent to which the advantages ofmultinational studies can be reconciled with the need forunlimited transferability when adapting the findings ofthese studies to a specific national context.MethodsA narrative literature review was performed to identifypotential reasons for limited transferability of results ofhealth economic evaluation from one country to another.Although we used some relevant single search terms (e.g.“transferability”) and search term combinations [e.g. “trans-ferability” AND “cost-benefit analysis (MeSH term)”], thesearch procedure was not based on a systematic approach.Based on these results, we further searched the methodo-logical literature for analytic approaches to handle therestrictions. Additionally we described the possibility oftransferring foreign economic study results to the countryof interest by matching trial data with routine data fromnational databases.ResultsReasons for limited transferabilityThe transferability of cost and effectiveness results obtainedin multinational studies to national contexts can be limitedby a large number of factors (Bryan and Brown 1998;Koopmanschap et al. 2001; Manca and Willan 2006). Here,it is important to keep in mind that problems related totransferability affect primarily economic findings (e.g.resources or costs). A number of authors have describedthe sources of limited transferability (Drummond and Pang2001; Koopmanschap et al. 2001; O’Brien 1997; PangJ Public Health (2010) 18:327–3352002); some of these are briefly presented in the followingsection:Differences in demography, epidemiology and individualpatient characteristicsIt is well known that individual patient characteristics haveat least an indirect influence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of any given intervention (Kaplan and Keil1993). Examples include socioeconomic or demographicfactors, both of which may exhibit systematic country-specific differences in terms of their extent or degree. Forinstance, it is conceivable that patients in one country mayshow significant differences in educational attainment orwealth compared to patients in the other countries takingpart in the same multinational study. This problem can beaddressed, where applicable, by defining strict inclusioncriteria (Koopmanschap et al. 2001). Patient-reported out-comes are also subject to regional variations and thus mayalso influence the evaluation of a treatment’s cost-effectiveness (O’Brien 1997). The same can be said forregional differences in the incidence and prevalence of aparticular disease. For instance, high prevalence of adisease in a certain country or region may lead todownstream experience curve effects on the part of localhealth care providers. In turn, high incidence of a diseasecan increase the cost-effectiveness of a given population-wide preventive measure (Koopmanschap et al. 2001). Thedisease incidence and the level of patients’ comorbiditieswill also be influenced by the age structure of a specificcountry’s population (Drummond and Pang 2001).Differences in country-specific health care and analysisstructuresAdditional factors that can limit the transferability of studyresults from one country to another can be traced to differencesin the design and organisation of health care systems. Examplesinclude differing systems of physician reimbursement andrelated incentive schemes (Koopmanschap et al. 2001;Drummond and Pang 2001) as well as differences in pricing(Drummond and Pang 2001). In Germany, the method andamount of physician reimbursement are based on consensusagreements reached by the National Associations of HealthInsurance Funds and the National Associations of SocialHealth Insurance-accredited Physicians. In contrast, the remu-neration of medical services in the USA is based on negotiatedcontracts with health maintenance organisations (HMOs) orother payers. For example, due to these differences, the UShospital care section is associated with comparably highercosts, which may lead to a higher utilisation in other health careareas (e.g. community services) in order to avoid the highhospitalisation expenditures (Pang 2002).329A striking example of the relevance of varying unit costsmay be the choice of a cost-effective clinical pathway forpatients with peptic ulcer disease and dyspepsia. Theseconditions are known to be associated with Helicobacterpylori infection, and eradication of this bacterium has beenshown to be an effective treatment strategy. H. pyloriinfection can be diagnosed by means of endoscopy or, lessreliably, by non-invasive laboratory tests. The cost-effectiveness of initial diagnosis of H. pylori infection bymeans of gastroscopy appears to be highly sensitive to theunit cost of the endoscopic procedure, which is muchhigher in the USA compared to European conventions(Bytzer 1999; Moayyedi 2007). As a consequence of thisdifference in cost, a clinical management strategy startingwith initial endoscopy has been described as a cost-effective option in Europe, whereas in the USA empiricalantisecretory treatment or non-invasive H. pylori testingwere identified as preferable options based on their cost-effectiveness (Bytzer 1999).Apart from unit costs, differences in country-specificmethods (upon which the economic evaluation is based)could potentially influence the results of an economicassessment. For example the cost-effectiveness perspectivecould lead to different findings regarding the cost-effectiveness of a treatment. Was an analysis performedout of a societal perspective including all indirect costs orfrom the point of view of a single health care participant(e.g. health insurance company)? Even if an analysis wasperformed from the well-chosen perspective of interest, thepossibility for a single-country adaptation could be limited.For example the economic evaluation results of a therapyfrom the perspective of a social insurance system will bedeeply influenced by the structure of this system. Such asocial insurance system could include a health careinsurance, pension insurance, nursing insurance etc. or justa part of these services.There are also country-specific differences in patient carepathways, which are partly shaped by guidelines estab-lished by national medical associations or differentlyorganised educational systems for health care professionals.Further limits on transferability can result from differencesin the fundamental organisational principles of health caresystems (e.g. central vs decentralised planning). Otherpotential problems when transferring the findings ofinternational studies to the national context can beidentified in a qualitative manner using checklists, such asthat provided in Table 1 (based on Heyland et al. 1996).Approaches to the economic analysis of multinationalstudiesIn principle, there are various approaches to address thequestion of heterogeneity of economic variables across330J Public Health (2010) 18:327–335Table 1 Checklist for evaluating the transferability of findings from (multi)national studies to other countries (adapted from Heyland et al. 1996)Transferability of clinical/epidemiological factorsAre there substantial differences between the populations eligible for recruitment to the study and the population of the country in question?Are the patients in the study comparable to those in the country in question?Are there any regional differences in the incidence and prevalence of the disease analysed in the study?In the event that preference-based outcomes (e.g. quality-of-life weights) are used in the study: have study investigators ensured that thepreferences of patients in the study are comparable to the preferences of the patients in the country in question?[...]Transferability of factors related to different health care systemsIs/are the study intervention(s) comparable to the applicable medical intervention(s) provided in the country in question?Are the costs of drugs, medical treatment, laboratory tests etc. comparable?Are the types and amounts of resources used comparable?Are accurate currency conversions possible between the different countries?Are the medical outcomes comparable to those observed in the health care system in question?Are the discounting rates used in the study transferable to the country in question?[...]countries in multinational studies. All methodologies aim totranslate real study data to an individual country. Under thereasonable assumption that internationally generated resultsfor the effectiveness of a treatment are less subject todifferences than cost results (Drummond and Pang 2001),the focus of the following observations is on the adaptationof economic cost results.Provided that data are both available and accessible, inprincipal a bottom-up approach should be pursued whereindividual data on resource consumption are the basis for bothindividual cost calculation and a subsequent total costevaluation (Hay and Jackson 1999). This methodology hasthe advantage that analysis of resource consumption can bemade directly on the basis of the direct cost sets of a specificcountry. This approach, however, requires detailed individualdata.As shown in Fig. 1, the calculation of the cost-effectiveness of an intervention will be performed via themultinational studyconsumptionof resourcescostseffectivenesscost-effectivenesscosts/effectiveness outcomesFig. 1 Determination of cost-effectivenesscombination of adapted cost results and (multi)nationaleffectiveness results.Pooled/split analysis approachBased on this pattern, different sources can be identified toanalyse effectiveness and resource data within a multina-tional study. In principle, different combinations areconceivable which are shown in Fig. 2.A completely pooled analysis assumes that there are norestrictions with regard to the adaptation of multinational studyresults at the level of a specific country. Since this assumption isnot very likely as previously noted, the partially pooled,respectively split analysis gains more relevance.With this approach only data of a certain countryselection (e.g. with comparable patient clientele and/orhealth care systems) or a single country concerned areselected for further evaluation. These methodologies areeasily comprehensible and thus a high transparency can beachieved for the methods and presentation of results.However, a disadvantage of this approach is the reducedsample size, which, in a fully split analysis, can reduce thesignificance of the results (Pinto et al. 2005; Reed et al. 2005).In any case, these analytic approaches are only feasible whenthe country of interest was involved in the study. Figure 3summarises the fundamental problems of pooled and splitanalyses.In practice, there are often pooled/split analyses in which, onthe one hand, pooled effectiveness data of all participatingcountries are taken into consideration, whereas, on the otherhand, only resource data of the country concerned areconsidered. This approach is a trade-off between a country-based assignment of resources and a high statistical powerconcerning the effectiveness data (Reed et al. 2005).J Public Health (2010) 18:327–335Fig. 2 Conceivable analysismethodologies/approaches forthe determination of resourcesand effectiveness data (our ownrepresentation)atadecruoserfoecruosAll participatingcountriesSample ofcountriesSingle countryStatistical approachesSince pooled/split analyses provide a compromise betweenrestriction-free transferability of the study results for acertain country and a high statistical power, during the lastfew years, statistical analyses have been developed toapproximate the optimal compromise. Among these,regression-based approaches belong to the most frequentlycommon statistical methodologies. A potential disadvan-tage of the statistical methods presented is, in part, thecomplexity of the approach which involves again a reducedtransparency, and thus reduces the potential use as adecision making aid (Reed et al. 2005).Hence, a study published by Koopmanschap et al.recommends the use of multivariate regression analyses.This is proposed in order to quantify and adjust differ-ences in resource consumption and costs in multinationalstudies in a way such that the studies would have beencarried out in only one country (Koopmanschap et al.2001). Herewith two options were pursued. A firstapproach uses the identification of the differences in the331source of effectiveness dataAll participatingcountriesfully pooledanalysispartially pooledanalysisSample ofcountriespartially pooledanalysisSingle countrypartially pooled/splitanalysispartially pooled/splitanalysispartially splitanalysispartially pooled/splitanalysispartially splitanalysisfully split analysistreatment samples and the associated consumption ofresources of the countries involved in order to formhomogeneous patient groups afterwards as precisely aspossible. For all groups of resources, statistically significantand relevant country differences are determined, which arethen subject to further correction. For example if in a country×% less laboratory tests are carried out (with consideration ofpossible differences in the patient characteristics), thenumber of laboratory tests of the patients of othercountries should be corrected downward by this factor ×.The corrected resource utilisations are then multiplied by acountry-specific cost set.A second approach tries to identify a possible country-specific influence directly at a cost expense level. In amultivariate regression analysis, the influence of differentcovariates (beside the country of the study, e.g. the age of thestudy participants and the disease status) on certain expenses isexamined. A limitation of the proceedings represented byKoopmanschap et al. arises because of the isolated focus onresources and/or expenses, with which possible country-specific effectiveness differences remain unconsidered.source of effectiveness dataatadecruoserfoecruosAll participatingcountriesSample ofcountriesSingle countryAll participatingcountriesSample ofcountriesSingle countrydecreasing transferability to asingle countryincreasing statistical powerincreasing transferability to asingle countrydecreasing statistical powerFig. 3 Fundamental limitations of pooled/split analyses (our own representation)332Other authors try to get around this limitation. In apublication of Willke et al. (1998) the attempt is undertakento identify both country-specific differences in effectivenessand the quantification of differences in resources and cost.The statistical methodology assumes that a number ofexogenous variables (e.g. disease stage), therapy outcomesas well as the interaction of country-specific treatment andcountry-specific outcomes per se influence costs of atreatment of an individual patient by treatment. Theproposal described by these authors considered alsocountry-specific outcome differences and thus partiallygoes beyond existing recommendations [e.g. OntarioGuidelines for Economic Analysis of PharmaceuticalProducts (Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care1994)] for the adaptation of multinational studies, becausefrequently only the consideration of possible country-specific cost and/or resource differences is required.Besides these statistical proposals, further statisticalapproaches have been generated in recent years (Cook etal. 2003; Grieve et al. 2005; Pinto et al. 2005; Thompson etal. 2006; Willan et al. 2005).Modelling of long-term costs and outcomesIn many situations the use of decision analytic models ispreferred because it frequently occurs that there are nopatient-based data available from the participating centresin the study or that the country of interest did not participatein the study (Drummond et al. 1997). So-called modellingstudies enable the adaptation of treatment effects identifiedat the study level to different populations and health caresystems. Often clinical studies are carried out withoutaccompanying collection of economic parameters. Anadvantage, which the health economic modelling can offer,is the possibility of using and combining data from differentsources.For example decision analytic models are nowadaysused to adjust study data to the real routine supply or totransfer study results to a country which did not participatein the study. An example of this approach is described inthe work of Menzin et al. (1996). The authors use adecision analytic model alongside the data of a phase IIIstudy in the USA for adaptation to the European context(France, Italy and Germany).A further type of application of decision analyticmodels exists in the health economic analysis of clinicalstudies, during which economic parameters were notcollected or were not available. Based on available studyinformation (e.g. characteristics of patient clientele,clinical processes, event rates etc.) resulting resourceconsumption is identified, on which basis a costevaluation of the study process could be performed. Viaextrapolation, an analysis of long-term costs of inter-J Public Health (2010) 18:327–335ventions or savings due to prevention of events isfeasible (Siebert 2003).According to the IQWiG guidelines, the use of amodel for the economic evaluation of interventions mustbe sufficiently justified (Bastian et al. 2006). In addition,a model must meet numerous quality standards. Thus,decision models must be described transparently andcomprehensibly and all assumptions must be explained.Likewise, there is a demand for the implementation ofsensitivity analyses along with a fully probabilisticapproach.Furthermore, decision models should be subject tovalidation. The mathematical computations must be vali-dated for their consistency with the model specifications,and it must be guaranteed that model input data and theoutcomes are consistent with the available data. If differentmodels come to different statements on the same questions,this identifies the necessity for a cross-validation of results(Bastian et al. 2006).Provided that the appropriate quality criteria have beenconsidered, the methodology of current health economicmodelling is well established as a subsequent analysis ofstudy data (Sculpher et al. 2004). Most internationalguidelines accept modelling in health economic evaluation(Hjelmgren et al. 2001; Schöffski and Graf von derSchulenburg 2007), although there remains some scepti-cism regarding the appropriateness of different modellingapproaches, especially where these appear to translateunimpressive clinical effects into highly cost-effectiveoutcomes.Transfer of data to a national settingOne approach which uses some elements of modellingbut adopts the efficacy of one single study of interest—possibly the pivotal key study on which registration wasbased—is to transfer data of a multinational trial to anexisting national data set. A key focus of this approach isthe linkage of patient data of the multinational studywith patient data from national data based on specificpatient characteristics (e.g. age, sex, insurance status,ICD diagnoses etc.). An important prerequisite for thepractical implementation of the matching process istherefore the existence of matching variables on thepatient level. If an international study delivers patient-level information only on sociodemography and therapyeffectiveness, economic data of comparable patients fromnational databases can be assigned by means of patientmatching. Important, however, is the selection of relevantmatching variables such as age, sex, disease stages etc.In a following step, differences of effectiveness betweenthe treatment arms are extracted and assessed accordingto the national cost schedule (e.g. the group differenceJ Public Health (2010) 18:327–335concerning cardiac events in studies with cardiovascularbackground).As a result, assessment of national cost-effectiveness canbe obtained by matching available patient characteristicsfrom the international trial with the national cost compo-nents. A problem is that the fundamental goal of clinicalstudies is the proof of the effectiveness of an interventionunder controlled conditions (efficacy). Therefore, thecollection of economic parameters in such studies isoften of less relevance. The matching process illustratedso far would therefore only reflect the cost-effectivenessat the time of the execution of the clinical study in thecountry concerned (dependence on the related matchingdatabase).A transfer of the cost-effectiveness results to the currentreal life setting would be achieved by incorporating datafrom national data sources (e.g. health insurance data). Theintegration of data from automated databases or healthservice research offers the potential to illustrate currentconsumption of resources and/or the costs of treatment ineveryday life. Owing to specific characteristics of theGerman health system, this approach could realise boththe adaptation to the national context and the considerationof real health care conditions.333Recommended analytic methodsBased on the analytic methods described above, a numberof recommendations can be made as to which methodapplies best to which situation. These recommendations aresummarised in a flow chart shown in Fig. 4. However, theserecommendations cover a restricted range of scenarios only.Indeed, it is very plausible that there are situations in whicha method different from those described would be moreappropriate.DiscussionAs the importance of health economic evaluations has grown,so has the number of methodological tools available. Today,broad ranges of approaches are used for the economic analysisof data from multinational studies, including study-basedtechniques, statistical methods and modelling. Despite this,none of the approaches described above is free of limitations.Finally, choosing a particular method always involves abalancing act between methodological transparency, statisticalpower and the transferability of results from multinationalstudies to different settings.pooled/splitanalysesstatisticalapproachesdata-transfer to anational settingWas the country of interest a part ofthe multinational study?yesnoAre patient-level dataaccessible?yesnoAre patient-level dataaccessible?yesnodecision-modelingdecision-modelingdecision-modelingdata-transfer to anational settingFig. 4 Recommendations for selected methods to analyse multinational studies334Inevitably, making decisions about the value ofpharmaceuticals in any context requires the combinationof data from different sources—this either can happen ina qualitative way through expert judgement or can beaddressed by means of some form of modelling scenario.Such economic models have potential strengths andchallenges. The greatest potential strength is in fullyprobabilistic modelling, which may provide appropriateestimates of cost-effectiveness in different circumstances,which may be specified by the modeller. The updatedBritish NICE guide on the methods of technologyappraisal also recommended this approach (Claxton etal. 2005). The greatest challenge is to avoid the situationwhere the design and population of economic models isundertaken with a particular aim and without objective useof available data.The importance of country-specific evaluations ofeffectiveness and, in particular, of economic data (e.g.costs and cost-effectiveness) is something that needs tobe considered even in the earliest phases of studydevelopment. Indeed, the timely documentation ofpotential country-specific differences can simplify thelater analysis and interpretation of study findings.Nevertheless, it would seem highly desirable to placethe available methods within a firm and binding framework—for example by establishing binding national and internationalguidelines.ConclusionThe technical problems surrounding the health economicassessments and adaptations based on multinationalstudies are well known and generally accepted. Fromthe perspective of national decision makers, there isnevertheless a great need to adapt the findings of thesestudies to the local setting, especially in light of theireconomic impact. There are a variety of methods foridentifying and adjusting country-specific differences incosts, effects and cost-effectiveness. As a result, multi-national studies will continue to play a crucial role in theevaluation of cost-effectiveness at the national level. Itseems likely that the growing interest in multinationalstudies will lead to continued developments in adaptationmethods, thus helping to ensure the consistency andtransferability of study findings between various settings.Acknowledgments We would like to thank Sanofis-Aventis GermanyGmbH for supporting this investigation by a non-restrictive researchcontribution.Conflict of interest The authors confirm that there are no relevantassociations that might pose a conflict of interest.J Public Health (2010) 18:327–335References<ref>Asplund K, Ashburner S, Cargill K, Hux M, Lees K, Drummond M,et al (2003) Health care resource use and stroke outcome.Multinational comparisons within the GAIN International trial.Int J Technol Assess Health Care 19(2):267–277</ref><ref>Bastian H, Bender R, Ernst AS, Kaiser T, Kirchner H, Kolominsky-Rabas P, Lange S, Sawicki PT, Weber M (2006) Methoden.
