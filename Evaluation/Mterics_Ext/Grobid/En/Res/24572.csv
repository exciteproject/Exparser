Both, the New Public Management and“governance” reforms have contributed to the contemporary problems in governing. Theseproblems have been political to a great extent, reflecting the tendency to emphasizeadministrative rather than democratic values. Governments have begun to react to the realand perceived problems within the public sector by developing a number of “meta-governance” instruments that can help steer public organizations but which involve lessdirect command and control. This paper addresses the contemporary governance tasks ofrestoring political direction and policy coherence while at the same supporting the autonomyof public organizations, and the involvement of policy networks, in governing.ZusammenfassungDie in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten durchgeführten Reformen des öffentlichen Sektorshaben zu mehr Effizienz und Effektivität geführt, aber auch eine Reihe von Problemen mitsich gebracht. Der Einzug von Ideen des New Public Management und des „Governance“-Ansatzes hat zu den Problemen des Regierens, wie wir sie heute beobachten können,beigetragen. Diese Probleme sind vor allem politischer Natur, da die Reformen zu einerÜberbetonung administrativer gegenüber demokratischen Werten geführt haben. Auf dierealen und die wahrgenommenen Probleme haben die Regierungen mit einer Reihe von„Meta-Governance-Instrumenten“ reagiert, die zur Steuerung öffentlicher Verwaltungenbeitragen können, aber weniger direkte hierarchische Kontrolle voraussetzen.

Whether the changes have been described as “reform”, “modernization”,“reinvention”, or whatever, most governments now are vastly different from what they wereeven a few years ago. These changes have, in general, produced governments that aremore efficient and effective. Further, although most of the reforms implemented have beenconceived largely within the market model (Peters, 2001) public administration is now alsomore open to public participation in many countries, and also has been opened to greaterparticipation by lower echelon public employees.The dominant pattern of reform of the public sector over the past several decades has beendiscussed as the “New Public Management” (Hood, 1991; Christensen and Laegreid, 2001),or simply NPM. The basic idea of NPM has been that government should be made to bemore efficient and effective, and that the best way of achieving these goals is to make thepublic sector perform more like the private sector. One component of these reforms hasbeen to enhance the autonomy of managers and their organizations, with the assumptionthat if managerial talent were unfettered by internal rules then the public sector would bemore efficient (DiIulio, 1994). In addition, this autonomy was to be enhanced by creatingnumerous autonomous organizations (see Niskanen, 1971) such as the “Next StepsAgencies” in the United Kingdom.Although the participatory dimension of change may have been discussed sotto voce inmany reform processes, it has become a more central conception of reform. In particular,while many of the initial stages of reform were discussed as the New Public Management,1the increased interest in “governance” styles of reform has enhanced the participatorydimension of change (Peters, 2005). Like the idea of the New Public Management“governance” as a concept can be extremely vague (see Pierre and Peters, 2000), and hasbeen the subject of significant academic contestation. That having been said, most of the“governance-style reforms” implemented by governments have emphasized the role of socialactors in making and implementing policy, and especially emphasized the role of networksand analogous structures in the processes of governing societies.While both the New Public Management and governance styles of reform have madesignificant contributions to the performance of the public sector, they have also created anumber of significant problems within government. In particular, both styles of reform havetended to create problems of incoherence and poor coordination in the public sector (see1 This term was, and is, extremely broad and to some extent included participatory ideas as well as the marketbased efficiency concepts. See Hood (1991).2 — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — I H SBakvis and Juillet, 2004) and, in addition, those reforms have created extensiveaccountability problems (Mulgan, 2000). Therefore, like almost every other reform initiativebefore them, both NPM and governance reforms have engendered a host of new reforms,and the process of attempting to “make government work better and cost less” continuesunabated.2 Very much like Herbert Simon famously argued approximately 60 years ago,most of the adages used in public management (and indeed private management) haveopposites that are in the right circumstances equally valid.Given the above discussion, we are dealing with several alternative futures for the publicsector in most industrialized democracies. Both of these futures will involve change, andboth will require continuing investment of political capital in order to be effective. Further, thecentral feature of these two futures is that one need not make a definitive choice betweenthem. Both are feasible, and their effects will be complementary. The central politicalquestion is not so much one of making a choice between the two, but rather finding a way ofmaking the two fit together in an effective, and democratic, manner.1. One Future – Continuing the Current Patterns of ReformAlthough I have been discussing them as alternative models of the public sector, as indeedthey are, the patterns of reform that have shaped contemporary government have a numberof things in common. Phrased in the most general manner, these reforms have tended tomove the process of governing out of the center of government. These reforms haveinvolved a number of different changes in patterns of governing, including:1) Deconcentration. One of the most important changes associated with the NewPublic Management has been creating a number of new autonomous or quasi-autonomous organizations – often referred to as agencies (Pollitt and Talbot, 2004;Verhoest, Rubecksen and Humphreys, 2007). A good deal of policymaking andimplementation in contemporary political systems has been delegated to theseorganizations, under the assumption that single-purpose organizations withmanagerial autonomy will allow skilled public managers to improve the quality ofpublic services. This deconcentration also represents some denigration of politicsand politicians in the process of governance.2) Decentralization. As well as moving some of the functions of the public sectorout to devolved organizations within central government, another strategy hasbeen to decentralize activities and give greater responsibility to sub-national2 This phrase was, of course, the sub-title of the National Performance Review (Gore Commission) in the UnitedStates but came to represent a general ambition for reformers in the public sector.I H S — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — 3governments. The logic of decentralization is in part to improve efficiency, given anassumption that smaller units will provide services better. Also, decentralization canbe justified on democratic grounds, with the public having perhaps greateropportunity for involvement at lower levels of governing.3) Delegation. A final strategy for reforming the State has been to delegate publicauthority to a variety of other actors (for general models see Huber and Shipan,2002). In the market approach to governing much of that delegation has been tocontractors and to other market actors. In the governance model much of thedelegation would be to networks and to not-for-profit organizations. Both types ofdelegation can be thought to improve the efficiency of the public sector, and theuse of networks of social actors also generally is argued to be important forenhancing the democratic element of governing.We might be able to add to this list of descriptions of change, but taken together allthe reforms mentioned here involve “decentering” the governing process (see alsoPeters, 2004). Although obviously different in terms of their details, and in terms oftheir justifications, the impact of all of the changes in the public sector has been tominimize control from the center of government – presidents, prime ministers andeven individual ministers.3 Thus, they all have at their heart an assumption (explicitor implicit) that government will work better if the political center is devalued, and ifpublic administrators and private sector actors are more responsible for deliveringservices.2. From Reform to New Problems Created by ReformThe above changes in the public are often justified by the familiar “steering not rowing” logic(Osborne and Gaebler, 1991), assuming that governments are better at setting directions forpolicy than they are at actually delivering those policies. In reality, however, these reformsmay also have reduced the steering capacity of the public sector, and in particular havereduced the capacity that political officials have enjoyed in the past for exercising controlover the policies of their governments. This reduction of the “primacy of politics”,4 has in turncreated several governance problems:3 This argument appears to be in direct contradiction to that usually found in comparative politics that emphasizesthe decline of parliamentary and even cabinet government in favor of prime ministerial domination – often incorrectlycalled the presidentialization of parliamentary regimes (see Von Mettenheim, 1997; Heffernan, 2003). Thatargument, however, focuses more on the political control of the process within government and changes in mediafocus rather than on the actual capacity of political executives to control policy.4 This term has come to be commonly used. For one of the earlier uses see Pollock (1951).4 — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — I H S1) Politics and Steering. As already implied, the emphasis on moving activitiesaway from the center of government has reduced the capacity of elected officials toexercise control over these policies, even though in democratic politics we assumethat elections are about choosing policy (see Rose, 1974; Caplan, 2007). To theextent that so much of government activity is delegated then political leaders areleft with few levers, and often poor quality levers, with which to affect the course oftheir own governments. Any number of prime ministers have expressed theirfeelings of impotence in the context of contemporary patterns of governing, butmany fewer have actually done anything about attempting to redress that balance(but see below).2) Coordination. A second difficulty resulting from the decentering of the publicsector has been reduced levels of coordination among policies and organizations.The notion of first splitting up large organizations into a number of smallorganizations, and then giving organizations greater autonomy has been central toreforming, especially the creation of agencies. The numerous organizationsoperating with increased autonomy has, however, tended to exacerbate the familiarproblems of coordination and coherence in the public sector. The proliferation oforganizations, in turn, also contributes to the difficulties in exercising politicalcontrol.3) Complexity. The larger number of organizations involved in governing, and themultiple ways in which they are linked to the more conventional parts of the publicsector, also increase the complexity of governing. While complexity is not per sedetrimental, it may counteract some of the efficiency gains generated throughmanagement changes. That is, the increased number of veto points in the system,and the difficulty in gaining acceptance at all those points does reduce chances ofsuccess. Further, complexity does tend to reduce the transparency of the publicsystem and therefore affects accountability (see below).4) Capture. By separating public organizations from direct connections to politicalauthority, the decentering reforms tend to make those organizations morevulnerable to capture by other interests. This is a classic problem in the analysis ofindependent regulatory agencies in the United States and elsewhere, but the logiccan be extended to cover a range of other organizations that have been detachedfrom political support. The capture may be by local geographical interests(Whitford, 2002) or by functional interests, but the idea of depoliticizing governmenttends to lead to other forms of politicization, often of a less desirable sort.5) Accountability. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the reforms in the publicsector have generated major accountability problems. One virtue of the “primacy ofpolitics” is that it identifies clearly a hierarchy of accountability in the public sector,I H S — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — 5and also identifies a number of mechanisms for enforcing that accountability. Whenthere are a number of alternative relationships between elected politicians andservice provision, and many of the service providers assume that they are meant toact autonomously, then identifying responsibility for actions is difficult.Thus, both from the perspective of democratic theory and from the perspective of policycapacity the reforms associated with the New Public Management approach, as well asthose coming from the governance approach, have generated a substantial need for furtherchange. As I will point out below, these changes can not be a simple return to the status quoante with public sector dominance, although some scholars are arguing for a return to moretraditional forms of public management (Olsen, forthcoming). Too much change has occurredand governments have learned too much about alternative mechanisms for deliveringservices to be able to make a simple return to the bureaucratized, hierarchical model ofgoverning (see Walsh and Stewart, 1992). In part, the changes in the public sectorassociated with these two reform movements have created substantial improvement in thefunctioning of the public sector, at least at the more micro-levels.5That having been said, however, the movement away from that style of governing has tosome extent been exaggerated, and much of the old system remained in place, if subsumedunder the facade of new forms of governing (Schofield, 2001). Further, some scholars arealso discussing the return to a Weberian style of governing in many settings, with aperceived need to reinvigorate some of the mechanisms for control and probity that werecomponents of more traditional forms of governing. This is far from just being reactionary, butrepresents the need to recreate some values that were central to making governments botheffective and accountable, and which have not been replaced adequately by the products ofreform.Leaving aside the return to a more Weberian style of governing, most of the problemsgenerated by the NPM and “governance” reforms can be encapsulated in the problem ofdemocratic government. Again, if elections are about selecting policy as well as leaders, andif those leaders once elected find that they have less influence over policy than they, andprobably their voters, believe is appropriate, then there is a fundamental democraticproblem. Even if the elected leaders are able to do some of their steering without the rowing,their level of policy control may not be as great as desired. This loss of control over policiesis evident for making policy choices, but is even more apparent given the crucial role thatimplementation plays in determining the true meaning of policy (Meyers and Vorsanger,2004).5 By that I mean that the closer one gets to the actual delivery of services, and especially to the operations ofindividual organizations, the greater have been the benefits of reform. When more systemic factors in governing areconsidered, the benefits of the reforms may be negligible and the costs may have outweighed the benefits.6 — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — I H S3. The Center Strikes BackHaving recognized their own difficulties in exercising control over the public sector, a numberof governments have begun to take action to attempt to restore control over the publicsector. In some instances this shift in ideas about governing has reflected particular politicalcircumstances, including changes in the political parties controlling the public sector. In othercases the attempt to reimpose greater political control has reflected more fundamentalchanges in ideas about governing. These changes reacting to the problems created by NPMet al. have not had the generality of either NPM or governance ideas, but they do reflect theperceived need to recapture some of the political steering that has been lost.Some of the attempts to reimpose control over governing have tended to run counter tomany of the canons of “good governance”. In particular, when faced with the number oforganizations and programs over which they perceive themselves to have little direct control,political leaders have tended to politicize the management of those programs. A number ofstudies of the public sector in the industrialized democracies (Peters and Pierre, 2004) haveshown that political leaders have found themselves in the position of having to take politicalresponsibility for programs that they have little capacity to influence directly, and that this isan extremely uncomfortable position for those leaders. One of the simplest means ofattempting to gain such control is to have one’s own people managing the programs, e.g. tomove toward higher levels of political appointment. Somewhat paradoxically, the internalderegulation of public employment fostered by NPM has facilitated those appointments.6In addition to politicization, the decentering of the State has tended to engender theidentification of scapegoats and denial of responsibility. As noted, political leaders maybelieve that they are being held responsible without justification, and in turn attempt to shedthat responsibility. To some extent the complaint is justified, given that many of the linkagesassociated with effective responsibility and accountability have been weakened, and many ofthe levers for control have been eliminated. In fact, even some of the mechanisms beingused in an apparent attempt to create responsibility for service provision may, in the end,dilute that responsibility. For example, the increasing use of “czars” for problem areas ofpublic service tend to deflect attention, and potentially accountability, away from the politicalleaders and in the direction of the “czar”.76 It is quite possible that these appointments are perfectly qualified as managers, but it is very clear that there aremore political forms of appointment, and that those appointments give the appearance of politicizing the publicsector in ways that in many politic systems are unacceptable.7 The Blair government in the United Kingdom was the most enthusiastic user of czars, for problems such as therailways, several aspects of the National Health Service, and for children’s services, among others. This mechanismenables the Prime Minister or a minister to argue that something has been done, and thereby to (attempt to) escapepersonal political accountability.I H S — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — 7Not all of the reactions to the perceived loss of political control have been as negative asthose already discussed. Perhaps most obviously, a number of governments have beenattempting to build mechanisms for coordinating the numerous programs and autonomousorganizations that have been created. One of the more obvious of these attempts has beenthe movement of “joined up government” in the United Kingdom, but there have beenanalogous programs in a number of other countries (Pollitt, 2005; Christensen and Laegreid,2007; Gregory, 2004). The basic idea has been to attempt to integrate government after ithad been disaggregated by previous regimes. In some cases, the attempt was structural, butin others there was a more intellectual thrust of attempting to create more “holistic”government that could provide a relatively seamless web of services (6, Leat, Setzler andStoker, 2004).To some extent the notion of joining up government, while certainly a valuable contribution togoverning, missed some of the crucial elements of the decentering reforms. The attempts toimprove coordination were indeed joined up government, and apparently were lessinterested in joining up the other non-governmental aspects of governing that had becomeso important. In fairness, attempting to produce integration at that level would be moredifficult, and might even be counterproductive, if viewed from rather conventionalperspectives of governing. That is, simply attempting to bring the various relationships withsocial actors into a single format, and/or to reduce autonomy, may eliminate the gains fromthe previous reforms without necessarily creating commensurate benefits.4. The GapThe discussion to this point reveals the presence of two distinct formats for contemporarygovernance. As already noted, these two styles, while distinct, are also to a great extentcomplementary. One governance style emphasizes the need to improve the quality ofservice delivery, the management of individual organizations, and the democratization ofthose services. The reforms associated with both NPM and with “governance” have beensuccessful in a number of cases, but then created the need for the second pattern ofchange, one that emphasizes the need to coordinate, create greater coherence, and torestore the primacy of politics. Each of these approaches to governing constitutes animportant contribution to the capacity to provide better governing, but they are ratherdifferent. The major task in governing, therefore, may become to “knit” together the twoalternatives.In addition to the practical issues of governing involved, these two approaches to governingrepresent interesting theoretical concerns. On the one hand, there have been importanttheoretical developments in the area of “governance” (Sørenson and Torfing, 2000; Klijn andKoopenjan, 2005). As implied above this term has come to mean a number of different8 — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — I H Sthings, but perhaps the dominant strand has emphasized the need to consider the process ofproviding direction to society, and providing public services, as involving actors well beyondthose nominally in the public sector. Thus, the “governance” reforms mentioned aboveaddress the involvement of a wide range of actors in making and delivering services, andthat involvement is reflected a justified in a growing body of social scientific literature.One could argue that the concern with governance is old wine in new bottles given that,especially in Northern European countries, varieties of corporatism and corporate pluralism(Rokkan, 1967) have been in existence for decades, if not centuries. The reality of theinvolvement of social actors with the public sector has to some extent changed as networkshave strengthened. Further, the theory surrounding that involvement of private sector actorshas certainly changed. For example, rather than much of the involvement being motivated bythe State itself (even in the corporate pluralist model), contemporary modes of “governance”allow for greater autonomy exercised by the social actors, and more autonomous self-organization of the networks that are to provide governance.8While governance theory, and its development of the logic of networks, has made a numberof contributions to our understanding of the processes of steering the economy and society,it also has a number of internal problems. One of the most important of these problems hasbeen the assumption of decision-making capacity of networks. The network model appearswell-suited for conditions in which the principal actors agree on goals and on means, butparadoxically if there were that level of agreement then there might be no need for thenetworks in the first instance.9 While the networks are advanced as alternatives toconventional forms of governing, they lack pre-determined decision-rules that both enabledecisions to be made in the most difficult of circumstances, and also legitimate thosedecisions.10In addition to the problem in making decisions at all, the absence of clear decision rules maylead to the decisions being sub-optimal. Much as Fritz Scharpf (1988) argued aboutdecision-making in multi-level governance systems, the need to reach consensus may leadto decisions by the lowest common denominator. If there are multiple constituencies with8 That having been said, some scholars of governance do note the extent to which the State is crucial forestablishing the framework under which the involvement of those actors are granted powers to make and implementpolicy. Likewise, networks might have little raison d’etre were State authority, even if delegated, available for theimplementation of the decisions made. These factors are crucial for the meta-governance arguments presentedbelow.9 The most obvious case would be epistemic communities in which there is an agreement based on a commonprofessional or scientific body of knowledge (see Adler, 1992).10 Majority rule in legislatures, for example, permits decisions to be made even in the face of conflict, while the moreconsensual logic of networks may render such decision-making difficult. Further, as these constitutional decisionrules are known in advance, they tend to legitimate those decisions, at least in the procedural sense of the term(Buchanan and Tullock, 1962).<ref>I H S — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — 9</ref>potentially extremely different ideas about policy then the only way to resolve the conflictsmay be to find the few points of agreement. The more or less incremental outcomes fromthat type of decision-making process may please established interests within the networks,but may add little to the capacity for innovation and for major policy change (but see Dente,Bobbio and Spada, 2003). That having been said, assuming that such incremental decisionscould be made, implementation would be facilitated because the potential opposition tochange would be coopted into the decision.Finally, and most importantly perhaps, the delegation of substantial amounts of authority hasled to major problems of democracy. These democratic problems involve not onlyaccountability but also representation – both fundamental democratic values. This is, ofcourse, rather paradoxical given that one of the principal justifications for at least someaspects of delegation has been to enhance public involvement. Despite those goodintentions only members of certain groups may be involved in the networks, and especially“potential groups” with low levels of organization may not be represented adequately.These challenges to governance theory mirror very closely the problems faced bygovernments in the “real world” discussed above. Delegation to networks, contractors, sub-national governments, or whatever other actor may be used to make and implement policycreates agency problems, so that the political principals can not produce effective control(Huber and Shipan, 2002). Whether the problem is phrased in terms of principals andagents, or in terms of more overtly political control issues, critics of governance havequestioned the capacity of these models to explain adequately the actual selection anddelivery of services, especially when considered in a democratic framework.5. Bridging the Gap: Meta-GovernanceThe theoretical development in governance has now extended to the idea of “meta-governance”, meaning in essence the governance of governance (see O’Toole, 2007). Theweaknesses of governance as an encompassing concept for describing what occurs withinin the contemporary processes of governing have become more apparent, even to someadvocates of the approach. This awareness has generated the need to think about themeans of building into governing processes increased control, while at the same timepermitting some autonomy for the networks and other forms of decentered governing. Anyreasonable conceptualization of contemporary governance processes must contain a greatdeal of decentered activity, and recognize that it is impossible to return to the status quoante. At the same time, however, that conceptualization must also recognize that all of the10 — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — I H Srequisite functions of governing a society can not be fulfilled by those decenteredprocesses.11Developing a working conception of meta-governance therefore helps to bridge the gapbetween the disaggregated processes within the contemporary public sector and the desireof many political principals to restore some direct control. In the bluntest terms then meta-governance would simply be reneging on the delegations of power and recenteralizingcontrols in the structures associated with the “conventional” public sector. As already argued,such a simplistic response is unlikely to be successful, and may not be politically viable.12The reforms of the past several decades are not unpopular with many people in and out ofgovernment, and have created their own constituencies. Further, the ideology of New PublicManagement continues to be widely accepted and those ideas continue to motivate policychoices concerning internal management. The discourse surrounding public managementhas been altered in a fundamental manner so that any simplistic atavistic response isunlikely to be acceptable.As well as thinking about meta-governance as a simple reaction to changes in the publicsector, and an attempt to recreate the past, it must also be understood as creating theconditions under which governance models can perform effectively. For example, much ofthe governance literature assumes that networks are self-organizing and autonomous, but inmany cases they must be created and fostered, often by the State. Likewise, in order to beeffective, a network must have a point of access in the public sector that legitimates andmotivates the involvement of the members, with public bureaucracies providing most ofthose points of access. In addition, the actions of any policy network may have to belegitimated and the formal institutions of the public sector themselves may be crucial for thatlegitimation. In short, no matter how substantial the internal capacity of the network may be,it may not be effective without the active involvement of government.6. The Instruments of Meta-GovernanceGovernments have at their disposal much of the same toolbox for meta-governance that theyhave for coping with other policy problems, but those tools are available in somewhatdifferent mixtures. The mixture has changed in part because of the specific tasks involved in11 Yes, this is a functionalist approach to politics and government. Although often denigrated functionalistapproaches do have the capacity to identify important issues and also to identify the possible solutions to thoseproblems. In particular, in this instance knowing what must be done to govern helps to understand why thedecentered formats may be inadequate.12 The politics involved here are more likely institutional politics, defending the prerogatives of some organization orprogram or another, rather than partisan politics. Those institutional interests may, of course, be connected to thesocial interests being served by the organizations involved.I H S — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — 11meta-governance as opposed to those of attempting to influence society. Importantly, meta-governance involves attempting to shape behaviors of organizations that have some politicallegitimacy of their own so that some of the usual authoritative relationship may not be asviable. The mixture of tools is now also different for meta-governance because there hasbeen some general move toward “New Governance” (Salamon, 2001), implying usingnegotiation, bargaining and broader ranges of compliance than in conventional commandand control styles of intervention. Given the general differences in meta-governance fromgovernance, it is necessary to consider some range of alternatives, or complements, tothose conventional mechanisms.Priority Setting. Perhaps the fundamental strategy for meta-governance is establishingpriorities, and establishing them politically. A fundamental weakness in the network and otherdecentered forms of governing is that all programs and goals are virtually equal. Thisequality is largely a function of delegating authority to organizations, all of whom presumethat their programs are at least as valuable as everyone else’s program. Likewise, even if thedecentered aspects of government are autonomous and quasi-autonomous organizationsthey still assume that they have been granted that autonomy in order to pursue their owngoals, rather than any more comprehensive goals for the “Whole of Government”.13Priority setting can be accomplished in a variety of ways. Most involve enhancing thecapacity of presidents, prime ministers and their central agencies. This need to strengthenthe center may appear somewhat ironic, given the tendency of parliamentary regimes todiscuss the “presidentialization” of politics, but the focus on the chief executive is often morea media event than a reflection of the capacity for governance (Peters, 2007). There aresome real attempts to strengthen the center and establish priorities. For example, theFinnish government now creates several cross-cutting programs as components of thecoalition documents for each new government (Bouckaert, Ormond and Peters, 2000). Othergovernments have attempted to restore some capacity to govern from the center (Savoie,2004), but the capacity to govern from the center still appears weaker than might beexpected.Soft Law. If conventional uses of authority are not appropriate for the tasks of meta-governance then some “softer” alternatives may be the necessary response. The shift to softlaw has been evident not just for meta-governance but like other elements of newgovernance has been applied to a range of situations (Morth, 2003). The basic notion of thisapproach to governing has been to use instruments such as benchmarks, guidelines,frameworks, and a host of other mechanisms that establish ranges of compliance rather than13 This term has been used by the Australian government and several other national governments to indicate theimportance of creating more comprehensive approaches to governing. Even in those cases, however, the links toprivate sector organizations, and even sub-national governments, delivering public services often are notadequately institutionalized.12 — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — I H Sspecific points of compliance. Further, these instruments tend to be the products ofdiscussions and negotiations rather than imposition from above.The nature of soft law is to establish ranges of compliance and provide direction rather thancommand action. This response to the meta-governance problem reflects the need to steerbut continue to do so at a distance, allowing a range of responses from networks, or localgovernments. The “softness” of the law may vary depending upon the object of the steering.For example, attempting to control sub-national governments that have some political baseof their own may be more challenging than attempting to control the private members of anetwork. Further, the capacity to use soft law effectively may vary across policy areas, withthose involving more directly the formal powers of the State being less amenable to informalstyles of steering and governance.147. Maintaining the Golden ThreadStrategies of decentering government and loosening control involve minimizing directcontrols over organizations and networks. For actors at the center, however, reducing levelsof control may not mean totally abandoning it, and some means of control may still bemaintained while simultaneously permitting autonomy in other areas of activity. Indeed, oneof the more interesting aspects of the contemporary discussions about autonomy and controlwithin the public sector is the dance being danced by central control structures andagencies, quangos and sub-national governments to whom substantial autonomy has beengranted, at least in theory (see Yesilkagit, 2007).Analytically, we (Bouckaert, Peters and Verhoest, 2007) have elsewhere discussed theautonomy of public organizations as involving three substantive dimensions – financial,human resources and policy. Thus, an organization may be given the latitude to make itsown decisions about personnel and about spending, but the center may retain control overthe policy choices of the organization. The available evidence, albeit generally not expressedin terms of meta-governance, is that central governments tend to maintain the financial pursestrings and use those to ensure adequate compliance along other dimensions of activity(Wanna, Jensen and De Vries, 2004). As well as varying substantively, the maintenance ofcontrols from the center may also be strategic or operational. That is, the controlorganizations may attempt to either control the frame of action of the (presumably)autonomous organizations or they may attempt more direct management of the day-to-daydecisions made by the organizations. The former may more clearly approximate the logic of14 For example, see the discussion of informal governance mechanisms by Helmke and Levitsky (2004).I H S — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — 13“steering at a distance”, but both represent some diminution of the real autonomy of theorganizations.The point of this discussion is that autonomy and control may not be as incompatible inpractice as they may appear conceptually. The logic of meta-governance, and the “knitting”to which I alluded above, is that both these concepts must co-exist, and are beginning to co-exist more effectively, within contemporary political systems. As argued concerning theutilization of soft law as an instrument for meta-governance, the actual mixture of autonomyand control is likely to be contingent, and may also be dependent upon the particular politicalsystem. The task for both the academic analyst and the practitioner is to identify mixturesthat can at once deliver effective political (democratic) control and maintain the efficiencygains that appear to have resulted from many of the NPM reforms. To square this circlemaintaining one or a few primary controls, usually the budget, may be an effective strategyfor meta-governance.8. Performance ManagementFinally, the increasing use of performance management in almost all developeddemocracies, and many other systems, provides a means of controlling potentiallyautonomous organizations (see OECD, 2007; Peters, 2007). Although the term may be usedin a variety of ways, the fundamental idea is that by using measurable targets for the resultsof public programs central control organizations can monitor and control the behavior ofthose organizations. This technique therefore shifts the mantra of New Public Managementfrom “let the managers manage” to “make the managers manage”, meaning that some of thelatitude inherent in the management ideas of NPM has been lost in favor of mandates tomanagers.Performance management has some attributes in common with soft law as an instrument formeta-governance. In particular, this method relies on negotiating frameworks and contractsto impose control over the organizations delivering services, as well as the individualsinvolved in those programs. The targets that are established in performance managementtend to be flexible, or tend to be progressive, so that the steering is rather “soft”, and permitthe organizations involved to have some latitude in how they reach the performance targets.In addition, levels of compliance tend to be progressive so that the levels at which anyorganization must perform tend to be negotiated year after year, with some continuing abilityto affect the outcomes of performance management.Performance management can help to solve several of the problems created by earlierreforms of the public sector. For example, when performance measurement andmanagement are used internally between ministries and their components (including14 — B. Guy Peters / The Two Futures of Governing — I H Sperhaps contractors as well as formal institutions within the public sector) they are importantelements of internal management and steering. However, when applied more directly byexternal organizations – parliaments, auditors, central agencies – then performancemanagement can be a very useful component for accountability. Especially when theperformance standards are made public these indicators are important for accountability aswell as for establishing general democratic frameworks for action.ConclusionGovernance has been and continues to be a scarce commodity in most countries. In manyways the capacity to govern has been enhanced significantly over the past several decadesthrough the spread of the ideas of both New Public Management and the ideas ofgovernance. These approaches to governing both tended to enhance the autonomy of lowerlevel components of the governing system, whether sub-national governments, agencies, ornetworks linking public and private actors. The capacity of organizations to make more oftheir own choices, and the capacity to employ management techniques not familiar to thepublic sector, have tended to make government more efficient and effective in servicedelivery.Despite the successes of many aspects of reform in the public sector, the problems ofaccountability and control that were inherent in these reforms have engendered asubsequent round of change. Although it is impossible to return to the governance modelsthat were the object of the NPM and “governance” reforms, some mechanisms foraddressing the accountability and other fundamental democratic issues raised by the firstround of reforms are required. The perceived negative consequences of reforms haveproduced some new types of governing, discussed here as “meta-governance”.The primary governance task, as outlined in this paper, therefore is to knit together these twostrands of change in the public sector. While the one strand represents the efficiency drivesof governing, the other tends to represent better the political, and especially democratic,aspirations for governing. The fundamental point here is that these two can be knit togethereffectively, but that the knitting will depend upon a number of contingent factors. The firstrounds of reform (and especially NPM) tended to assume that one size fit all, but the abilityto use management techniques as well as the types of meta-governance that are viable aredependent upon a number of political and policy factors that require additional explication.Thus, the task of coping with governance will continue to require extensive research andanalysis by both practitioner and academic analysts.I H S — B.
