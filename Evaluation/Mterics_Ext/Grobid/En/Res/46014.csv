In this paper, we investigate the cer-tificate-competence relationship, operationalized as skills gaps by level of educationalattainment. More importantly, we scrutinize how two aspects of educational stratifica-tion processes, vertical stratification and occupation-specificity, affects skills gaps. Us-ing data on 25-54 year olds from the 2011/12 round of the Programme for the Interna-tional Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), we find that more occupation-specificeducation systems produce smaller differences in basic general skills between adultswith low and intermediate levels of education. Higher levels of vertical stratification, bycontrast, result in larger low-intermediate skills gaps. None of the two stratificationaspects can however explain variations in the skills gaps between intermediate andhigh educated adults. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings forlabor market research.AcknowledgementThis research was supported by a grant from the German Federal Ministry of Educationand Research (grant number PLI3061).

IntroductionScholars agree that the relationship between educational degrees and competenc-es or skills may vary across countries. Yet previous research has devoted surpris-ingly little attention to the sources of this cross-national variability. To ourknowledge, only one quantitative study has attempted to explain country differ-ences in the relationship between certificates and skills among adults: Using dataon 19 countries from the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS, conducted be-tween 1994-1998 by the OECD), Park and Kyei (2011) examined literacy differen-tials by level of formal qualification (less than upper secondary education, uppersecondary or non-tertiary post-secondary education, and college/tertiary educa-tion). They found substantial cross-national variation in literacy gaps between lessand intermediate educated adults and, to a lesser extent, also between adults withintermediate and high levels of formal qualification (cf. Park and Kyei 2011:894-5). The main country-level explanatory variable examined by Park and Kyei waswithin-country heterogeneity of school quality, measured as between-school ine-quality of various resources (e.g., instructional resources, class size, or teacherexperience). They showed that greater between-school resource inequality is asso-ciated with larger low-intermediate literacy gaps. Resource inequality, however,did not explain differences in intermediate-high literacy gaps.Quite strikingly, Park and Kyei (2011) did not consider differences in educa-tional stratification processes as an explanatory factor. They argued that“[b]ecause we are interested in literacy gaps between adults who did not graduatefrom high school (or may never have attended high school) and adults with highschool degrees or higher, tracking is much less relevant for our study, even forcountries with tracking systems (unless the tracking occurs at an early age).Moreover, studies that focus on tracking effects cannot address differences in oth-er important aspects of educational systems among countries with the same typeof tracking system.” (Park and Kyei 2011:882) They decided to therefore “look atinstitutional factors that are likely to be more universally relevant”, namely be-tween-school inequality in basic school resources (Park and Kyei 2011:882).In this study, we reconsider the potential role of educational stratification forexplaining skills gaps by educational attainment. We focus on two distinct types ofstratification: vertical stratification by student performance in lower secondaryeducation (e.g., via achievement-related tracking) and horizontal stratification interms of the primary content of educational programs in upper secondary educa-tion (occupational/vocational vs. general). There are at least two reasons why weshould not rule out a priori that these two types of stratification condition the re-lationship between formal certificates and competences. First of all, there is sub-stantial variability in the extent of stratification. Taking the example of verticalstratification, it is clear that countries do not simply track or not: Tracked educa-tion systems differ with respect to things such as the number of tracks or the agewhen tracking occurs (Bol and Van de Werfhorst 2013). Further, as we discuss be-low, even non-tracked education systems may differ in terms of how strongly– 1 –high- and low-performing students cluster in the same schools and classrooms(e.g., because of differences in residential segregation). Second, and relatedly,there are strong reasons to expect that educational stratification influences therelationship between formal qualifications and competences: Educational stratifi-cation processes channel individuals into different learning environments (social-ization) and/or different programs that lead to different levels of formal qualifica-tion (allocation) (cf. Allmendinger 1989:236; Kerckhoff 1995:326; Meyer 1977).Higher degrees of educational stratification may thus affect the relationship be-tween competences and educational degrees via (competence-based) selection intodifferent (more or less favorable) learning environments or formal educationalprograms (Gamoran 1986; Hallinan 1992).More concretely, we extend the study by Park and Kyei (2011) in three ways.First, we investigate the impact of educational stratification processes on skillsgaps by educational attainment, distinguishing between vertical (i.e., perfor-mance-related) stratification of lower secondary education and horizontal stratifi-cation, that is, occupation-specificity of upper secondary education. We also com-pare the importance of these dimensions of educational stratification to that ofbetween-school inequality in instructional resources in lower secondary educa-tion, the focal variable of Park and Kyei (2011). Second, we use new data from thefirst round of the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies(PIAAC)—conducted in 2011/12 by the OECD. This data set contains information oneducational certificates and generic basic competences (literacy and numeracy) ofthe adult population for more than 20 countries. Not only are the competencemeasures in PIAAC of much higher quality than in IALS (see Section 3). PIAAC alsoembraces a broader country sample, especially by including “achievement-oriented” East Asian countries (Korea and Japan). Third, even though our empiricalcontribution is restricted to (institutional sources of) cross-country variation inskills gaps, we do discuss some important implications of our findings for the in-terpretation of certificate and skills effects in labor market regressions.The paper is structured as follows. We start with theoretical considerationsabout country variation in skills gaps by educational certificates (Section 2). InSection 3, we describe the PIAAC data and the methods used in our analyses. Wepresent our empirical analysis in Section 4. Section 5 concludes by summarizingour findings and discussing their implications for studies of competence and cer-tificate effects on labor market outcomes.– 2 –2.Country variation in skills gaps by educationaldegreesWe investigate country differences in two “skills gaps” as indications of the rela-tionship between competences and educational degrees: The “lower skills gap” isdefined as the (adjusted) difference in mean basic cognitive competences betweenadults with low (less than upper secondary) and intermediate (upper secondary ornon-tertiary post-secondary) levels of educational attainment. The “upper skillsgap” is defined as the difference between adults with intermediate and high (ter-tiary) levels of education.Our basic assumption is that educational stratification processes sort individ-uals into different learning environments and thereby define opportunities toacquire educational degrees and (different types of) competences or skills. Corre-spondingly, one would expect that in more stratified systems formal certificatestend to be more closely related to (specific types of) skills. Plausible mechanismsthrough which more stratified systems strengthen the link between formal quali-fications and skills include selection on the basis of pre-existing differences incompetences (allocation), reinforcement of pre-existing differences due to the al-location of better-performing students to more favorable learning environments(socialization), and/or greater between-program (and hence between-student) dif-ferences in the types of skills that are emphasized (socialization and allocation).Before we elaborate on these issues, we need to say a few words about thetypes of skills measured in PIAAC. In all countries, respondents were assessed withrespect of two types of “key information-processing skills” (OECD 2013:3): literacy(reading and text comprehension) and numeracy (applied numeric and mathemat-ical skills).1 These skills are undoubtedly important, but it is important to be clearabout what they are and what not. The literacy and numeracy skills assessed inPIAAC are probably best described as basic (as opposed to advanced) and general(as opposed to specific). The focus in the literacy domain was on the comprehen-sion of (short) pieces of text (such as instructions or newspaper articles) that citi-zens of economically advanced societies might encounter in everyday life, insideand outside of work. It was not on understanding (or writing) research articles orother long and complex documents. In the numeracy domain, the focus similarlywas on everyday tasks involving numerical operations such as correctly inter-preting bar charts that might appear in newspaper articles or government bro-chures. It was not on solving problems that require knowledge of inferential sta-tistics or calculus.Even though it is likely that the skills measured in PIAAC are to some extentcorrelated with more advanced competences, the latter were not directly tested(see Section 3). As we discuss below, this may limit our ability to ascertain compe-1 A third domain, “problem solving in technology rich environments”, is unfortunately only avail-able for a subset of countries and only for respondents who took the assessment on a computer(OECD 2013).– 3 –tence differentials in the upper part of the educational distribution, where wewould expect to see differences primarily with respect to advanced skills. In addi-tion, the skills assessed in PIAAC are general (or transferable) in the sense thatthey are likely to be useful in a large variety of work- and non-work settings. Oc-cupation-specific skills (e.g., knowing the functioning of a car engine or certainprogramming languages), which are useful only in a much smaller set of specificoccupations (and therefore emphasized by the respective training programs), werenot measured. In the following discussion of how educational stratification condi-tions the link between formal qualification and skills, we will primarily focus onthe relationship between qualifications and basic general skills as they are meas-ured in PIAAC—because this is the relationship that we can ascertain empirically.Nevertheless, the (unobserved) types of skill (advanced and occupation-specific)also play a crucial part in our argument.Returning to educational stratification processes, we begin with vertical strati-fication, by which we mean sorting by performance (ability) into different educa-tional environments. A well-known form of vertical stratification is external dif-ferentiation via (ability) tracking. A broad definition of vertical stratification interms of “performance-segregated learning environments” directs attention tovertical stratification occurring through processes other than explicit tracking.Explicit tracking (or “external differentiation”) in lower secondary education cer-tainly is an important source of vertical stratification, but it is not the only onepossible. Residential segregation by family background—in combination with res-idence-based allocation to schools—might result in high levels of vertical stratifi-cation even in a system where children are not explicitly sorted into differentacademic tracks (cf. Kerckhoff 1995:327). The US is a good example: It has a com-prehensive school system with little external differentiation, but due to (socioeco-nomic) residential segregation nevertheless an intermediate degree of verticalstratification—in the sense that there is considerable between-school variation inaverage student performance, that is, high and low-performing students tend tocluster in different schools. In the US-American case, a decentralized funding sys-tem may further raise the consequences of this clustering for skills acquisition:Because they tend to be located in less affluent neighborhoods, schools with low-er-performing students will typically have fewer resources (Park and Kyei2011:883). Other countries that differ noticeably in the degrees of school-levelsegregation by student performance (“performance sorting”) and “external differ-entiation” are Italy, Japan, and the UK (cf. Appendix Table A2).A first reason for expecting vertical stratification—school-level segregationby performance—to be associated with differences in skills gaps is that segregat-ed learning environments may reinforce preexisting differences in competences:Literature on the so-called reflected-glory (or assimilation) effect suggests thatlower-performing students’ motivation and learning processes benefit fromclassmates with higher levels of proficiency (e.g., Cialdini and Richardson 1980;Snyder, Lassegard, and Ford 1986). In more stratified systems, low-ability studentsare deprived of such positive stimulation—when it comes to imparting basic cog-nitive competences in literacy and numeracy. This reflected-glory effect might be– 4 –reinforced by larger differences in the aspiration levels of curricula and teacher’sexpectations and aspirations in more vertically stratified systems.A second mechanism through which vertical stratification might affect skillsgaps by educational attainment is selection. In countries with tracked systems,low-performing students likely face greater difficulties in gaining access to pro-grams leading to higher educational degrees. Thus, at one and the same education-al level, there should be smaller within-group heterogeneity with respect topreexisting differences in performance or ability. In particular, higher degrees ofvertical stratification in lower secondary education might raise the probabilitythat individuals with low initial levels of basic competences do not transition to orcomplete upper secondary education, thus ending up in the group with low formalqualifications. Conversely, in more inclusive systems, more of these individualswould presumably be found among the intermediate educated, lowering the meancompetence level of this group—and thus the gap in basic competences betweenthe individuals with low and intermediate levels of formal qualifications. By thesame token, that is, because of selection processes that exclude low-performingstudents from gaining access to programs at the upper secondary level, one mightexpect skills gaps between intermediate and higher educated adults to be small(er)in countries with higher degrees of vertical stratification.To sum up, if selection processes based on ability and/or reflected-glory-typeprocesses are important, then higher degrees of vertical stratification lead to asituation where initial cognitive competences influence access to more favorableeducational environments, that is, to a mutually reinforcing process of compe-tence-based selection into less or more favorable learning environments. Giventhe expected negative consequences of vertical stratification for low-performingstudents, it is plausible to assume that vertical stratification primarily affects therelationship between certificates and competences in the lower part of a country’seducational distribution. Differences in basic cognitive competences between lessand intermediate educated individuals should be most strongly influenced by se-lection and different learning opportunities: Low-performing students end up inless stimulating learning environments in terms of enhancing their basic cogni-tive competences.As for country-level variation in skills gaps, we therefore hypothesize that thegap in basic competences between less and intermediate educated adults riseswith a country’s level of vertical stratification in lower secondary education (hy-pothesis 1a). In contrast, according to the reflected-glory effect, individuals withintermediate and high educational degrees should be exposed to more stimulatingschools or school tracks—and thus to learning environments that are more simi-lar with respect to preserving and enhancing basic (as opposed to advanced) gen-eral competences. For the gap between intermediate and higher educated adults,we would therefore expect to find no effect of vertical stratification. If anything,we would expect to see smaller skills gaps in countries with higher degrees of verti-cal stratification of lower secondary education, because of a selection effect (i.e.,individuals with low competences are more effectively excluded from entering edu-cational programs that lead to intermediate formal qualifications) (hypothesis 1b).– 5 –These hypotheses and especially hypothesis 1a are based on the assumptionthat reflected-glory type processes predominate. There also exists a literature onthe so-called big-fish-little-pond effect (Marsh 1987), which argues opposite to thereflected-glory effect. According to this explanation, the self-concept, motivation,and ultimately performance level of lower-ability students are negatively affectedby peers with higher levels of proficiency. An implication of this effect is thatlow-ability students would be better off in terms of motivation and learning inmore stratified school systems. In addition, teachers might be better able to tailortheir teaching to the needs of students if the latter are more homogeneous. Thesearguments would suggest that hypothesis 1a will be falsified: The gap in basiccompetences between less and intermediate educated adults should decrease witha country’s level of vertical stratification in lower secondary education. In termsof hypothesis 1b, only the selection effect would than apply, that is we would findlower skills gaps in more stratified countries.The second dimension of educational stratification that likely affects skillsgaps is horizontal: the degree of occupation specificity of upper secondary education.This feature is related to the question of what is learned in different tracks (at thesame educational level): whether a country’s system of upper secondary educationputs greater emphasis on general or occupational/vocational skills. In more occu-pation-specific education systems, curricula and attention are directed more to-wards vocational than general skills (cf. Hanushek, Woessmann, and Zhang 2011;OECD 2010:59-60; OECD 2013:200-2; Shavit and Müller 2000).We cannot directly explore the relationship between general competences, oc-cupation-specific skills, and educational certificates with PIAAC (because occupa-tion-specific skills were not measured). But it is plausible to assume that greateremphasis on occupation-specific skills in (upper) secondary education draws someresources (e.g., teaching and learning time) away from the acquisition of generalcognitive skills. Thus, more of the learning time of intermediate-educated adultsis devoted to acquiring occupation-specific skills rather than basic competences incountries with greater occupation-specificity. This is particularly true for coun-tries with apprenticeship systems, like Germany or Austria: “In many apprentice-ships, there is a rather small element of numeracy and literacy skills as part of the(typically) one or one and a half days a week part-time school element in the dualsystem.” (OECD 2010:60)In addition, occupation-specific upper secondary education systems are a con-stitutive part of occupational labor markets (Marsden 1990; Hall and Soskice2011)—meaning that in these countries adults with vocational upper secondaryeducation have rather good labor market opportunities in terms of occupyingskilled position, while in general upper secondary education systems school leav-ers need to continue and finish tertiary education as a “safety net” to avoid un-skilled jobs (Shavit and Müller 2000). Hence, in the latter countries, more adultsattend college or university education than in occupational labor markets. This isevident in a rather high correlation between degree of occupation-specificity ofupper secondary education system (Appendix Table A2) and the proportion of ter-tiary educated adults (Appendix Table A1) of -0.65. This suggests that entry into– 6 –tertiary education is more selective with respect to preexisting differences in per-formance or ability in occupation-specific countries—and less selective in gen-eral-education countries.Given these two mechanisms—learning time devoted to general competencesin upper secondary education and selection into tertiary education—, occupation-specificity in upper secondary education might again differently affect the size ofthe lower and the upper skills gap. For the skills gap (in basic general competenc-es) between less and intermediate-educated adults, we expect to find smaller gapsin countries with higher degrees of occupation-specificity of upper secondary ed-ucation—because the intermediate group devoted a substantial portion of theirlearning time in upper secondary education to acquiring occupational rather thangeneral skills (hypothesis 2a). As for the upper skills gap—that is, the gap betweenintermediate and higher educated adults—, we would expect it to be larger incountries with higher degrees of occupational specificity (hypothesis 2b). Again,this is partly because the intermediate group in more occupation-specific coun-tries more heavily invested in occupation-specific skills. Yet it is also because ofcountry differences in the selectivity of attending higher education: In occupa-tion-specific countries, where vocational training programs at the upper second-ary level provide a good alternative, those who decide to attend higher educationshould be a more selective, academically inclined group than in general systems.One might suggest that we more directly test our assumption about the impactof attending a vocational program in upper secondary education, namely by com-paring skills gaps between adults with vocational and general upper secondaryeducation. This is, however, not a convincing approach. The PIAAC data provideonly information on the highest educational degree completed. Hence those withgeneral (as opposed to vocational) upper secondary education do not comprise allindividuals who ever attended general programs at the upper secondary level:They rather are a selective group that did not continue with tertiary education. Inthis paper, we therefore rely on our indirect hypotheses and take their verifica-tion/falsification as a signal (proxy) of “theoretical constructs that provide hypo-thetical links between observable events,” although they cannot can be (directly)observed (Hedström and Swedberg 1996:290).The two institutional characteristics of education systems—vertical stratifica-tion and horizontal stratification in terms of occupation-specificity—co-exist indifferent combinations and in some countries their effects may cancel each otherout. We expect the lower skills gaps to be smaller in more occupation-specific andto be larger in more stratifying education systems—and vice versa for the upperskills gap. Some well-known examples combine both a high degree of occupation-specificity and of vertical stratification (like Austria or Germany), or both a lowdegree of occupation-specificity and of vertical stratification (like Canada). If thisrelationship (i.e., of a positive relationship between occupational specificity andvertical stratification) holds more generally (which, as we show in Section 3, itdoes), then the expected effects of occupational specificity and vertical stratifica-tion should be stronger when both characteristics are included simultaneously inthe regression.– 7 –3.Data and MethodsData and sampleFor our empirical analysis, we use data from the first round of the Programme forthe International Assessment of Adult Competencies (OECD 2013). Data collection tookplace in 2011/2012 in a total of 24 countries. All samples are probability samplesof the 16 to 65 year old population, with a minimum sample size of 5,000 and atotal sample size of approximately 160,000 cases. Our analysis is based on thepublic use files that are available on the OECD’s PIAAC webpage.2We include 21 of the 24 participating countries. We exclude Cyprus because ofa very high share of “literacy-related non-respondents” of 17.1 percent (for moredetails, see below), Russia because of concerns about data quality, and Australiabecause it does not provide a public use file. “Belgium” is included but PIAAC wasonly conducted in the region of Flanders.PIAAC provides internationally comparable information on educational certifi-cates based on the 2011 revision of the International Standard Classification ofEducation (ISCED). We distinguish between low (ISCED 0-2), intermediate (ISCED 3-4) and high (ISCED 5-6) education—roughly equivalent to having completed lessthan upper secondary, upper secondary or (non-tertiary) post-secondary, and ter-tiary education, respectively.The unique feature of PIAAC is that it provides high-quality data on basic cog-nitive competences or “key information-processing skills” (OECD 2013). All coun-tries mandatorily administered test items to assess respondents’ reading and textcomprehension skills (literacy) and practical mathematical skills (numeracy). Athird skill domain, problem solving in technology-rich environments, was optionaland is therefore not available for all countries. Literacy and numeracy scores arevery highly correlated. For example, the country-level correlation between thelow-intermediate numeracy and literacy gaps (adjusted for key individual-levelcharacteristics, see below) is 0.95 in our sample. Results for literacy and numeracygaps therefore tend to be very similar and we only present results for numeracygaps in the paper.The PIAAC data are of much higher quality than the first large-scale interna-tional survey of adult competences, the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS),which was conducted in the mid-1990s. First, the quality of competence measure-ments has advanced considerably since the mid-1990s, partly due to the advancesspawned by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Second, inIALS information on educational certificates was incorrect for four countries(Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, and the UK). These misclassifications can be re-mediated based on information available in the IALS data (for details seeGesthuizen, Solga, and Künster 2011). Unfortunately, the erroneous education var-2 We use the updated public use files that were released on November 7, 2013, approximately onemonth after the initial release (http://www.oecd.org/site/piaac/publicdataandanalysis.htm).– 8 –iables also lead to problems with the IALS competence scores that cannot be fixed:To limit respondent burden, IALS—like other large-scale assessments such asPISA, TIMSS, and also PIAAC—administered only a relatively small number of testitems to each interviewee. These items on their own are insufficient for con-structing accurate competence scores. Respondents were therefore assigned a setof (multiply imputed) “plausible values” on the basis of test performance andbackground characteristics. These background variables comprise various educa-tion measures and in the case of IALS presumably included the erroneous qualifi-cations variable (detailed information on the imputation procedure are no longeravailable, but see Kirsch, 2001:31, for further useful information).Our sample is restricted to respondents who were 25 to 54 years old in 2011,that is, to birth cohorts 1957 to 1987. These respondents had mostly left educationin 2011 and went to secondary school between the 1960s and early 2000s—thusafter post-war educational expansion in most countries. We exclude respondentswho obtained their highest degree in a foreign country because their degrees andcompetences cannot be considered as results of the education system of their cur-rent country of residence.Some respondents sampled by PIAAC were not administered the full interviewbecause of insufficient proficiency in the interview language (the most commonreason), reading or writing difficulties, or learning or mental disabilities. Forthese so-called “literacy-related non-respondents” (LRNR) only information ongender and age is available. Excluding them from the analysis could bias our re-sults, because their share differs considerably across countries. In our sample, theproportion of LRNR ranges from zero percent to 3.8 percent in the US and 4.8 per-cent in Belgium (see Appendix Table A1). Most LRNR likely have low levels of basiccompetences and formal education. Even though country differences in the pro-portion of LRNR may seem small, this group can be quite large in relation to thegroup of less educated adults (ISCED 0-2). Excluding them could thus be quite con-sequential when, as in this paper, less educated adults (or their difference to in-termediate educated adults) are of particular interest. Our analysis therefore in-cludes LRNR (in contrast to the study of Park and Kyei 2011, because this is notpossible with the IALS data). For doing so, we had to assign LRNR respondents val-ues on all variables other than gender and age. We proceeded as follows. First weassigned a (very low) numeracy score of 85 to LRNR. This is the value used by theOECD (2013:69) in robustness checks that explore the impact of including LRNR oncountry differences in average competence scores. Using these assumed compe-tence scores and information on age and gender, we then obtained 10 imputationsof all other variables relevant to our analysis, including highest educational de-gree (see below). Including LRNR substantially raises the share of the less-educated group in some countries, for example, from about 10.2 to 13.0 percent inthe US and from 11.5 to 15.1 percent in Belgium.Overall, the PIAAC data for the 21 countries in our analysis include a total of88,818 observations who meet our age restriction. We exclude 3,538 cases whoobtained their highest degree in a foreign country and another 30 cases for whomthis information is missing although they do not belong to the group of literacy-– 9 –related non-respondents. We exclude another 168 cases that are not LRNR, buthave missing information on at least one of the variables included in the analysis.Our final sample comprises 83,999 “regular” respondents with complete infor-mation and 1,079 literacy related non-respondents.3Methods and variablesOur data have a two-level structure: We study respondents who are nested withincountries. We analyze these data using a two-step procedure. In a first step, weestimate the two numeracy gaps for each of the 21 countries in our sample, con-trolling for key individual characteristics (see below). In a second step, we thenregress the estimated numeracy gaps on our focal variables—different measuresof vertical stratification and occupation-specificity—and additional country-levelcontrol variables (see below). These country-level regressions are estimated usingweighted least squares (WLS). WLS is used to increase efficiency by incorporatinginformation on the uncertainty of the numeracy gap estimates (as contained inthe standard errors of the estimated numeracy gaps; for further details on thistwo-step approach, see Lewis and Linzer 2005). We report heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors to safeguard against any remaining heteroscedasticity.As a sensitivity analysis, we also carried out the two-step procedure with ordinaryleast squares at the country level and the results were very similar (results areavailable on request).This two-step approach is an alternative to simultaneous estimation via (re-stricted) maximum likelihood, often referred to as hierarchical or multilevel mod-eling. We opted for the two-step approach because it does not impose strong as-sumptions on the distribution of the country-level error terms and allows the ef-fects of control variables to vary across countries (Achen 2005). Our approach alsofacilitates inspection of country-specific estimates and thus the detection of sub-stantively interesting cases and/or outliers, which are readily overlooked withsimultaneous estimation and important to consider especially in country compari-sons consisting of less than 30 or even 50 cases (Bryan and Jenkins 2013).4 De-scriptive information for all individual and country level variables is displayed inAppendix Tables A1 and A2.3 Consistent with our analysis of non-LRNR, we exclude LRNR from the analysis of a given imputa-tion if the variable “foreign degree” takes the value “true” for that imputation. The set of LRNRcases included in the analysis thus differs slightly across imputations. Four LRNR are excludedcompletely because they were imputed as having a foreign degree in all 10 imputations.4 There is a shortage of systematic comparisons between these different approaches in country-comparative settings. It is clear on analytic grounds that simultaneous estimation will be moreefficient than the two-step approach when the data come reasonably close to meeting the strong-er assumptions of the former approach (e.g., normality of cluster-level error terms)—but it is notclear how close “reasonably close” is. The efficiency gains are probably modest when the numberof individual observations per cluster is relatively large so that cluster-specific parameter esti-mates are relatively precise (Lewis and Linzer 2005). This is the case in our application, as it is inmost applications where the higher-level units are countries (as opposed to, for instance, schoolsor classrooms). Recent studies using the two-step method are Gebel and Giesecke (2011) andHeisig (2011).– 10 –Our individual-level regressions adjust mean numeracy differences betweeneducational groups (our two skills gaps) for differences in the following variables:age (5-year groups), gender, being below age 30 and in formal education (to ac-count for country differences in the typical age of completing vocational and ter-tiary education), and foreign-birth/foreign-language status (to control for countryvariation in the migrant population) (see Appendix Table A1). The latter variablehas four categories indicating whether a respondent was born in the countrywhere she took the test and/or whether her primary language was that of the testlanguage or another language. We exclude adults with high levels of educationfrom the estimation of the lower skills gap and adults with low levels of educationfrom the estimation of the upper skills gap. The effects of these compositionalvariables are thus allowed to differ across the educational distribution.As noted above, to limit respondent burden, PIAAC administered only a rela-tively small number of test items to each individual. Individual competence scoresare therefore quite uncertain. To account for this uncertainty, PIAAC provides 10so-called plausible values rather than a unique competence score for each re-spondent, much like multiple imputation uses multiple imputations to account forimputation uncertainty. PIAAC also provides jackknife replicate weights (80 formost countries) to adjust variance estimates for the different complex survey de-signs of participating countries. We also took these weights into account, meaningthat the estimated numeracy gaps and associated standard errors are based on upto 800 regressions per country (80 jackknife weights—or the number of availableweights—times 10 plausible values). All estimations were carried out in Stata 13.We now describe the macro-level variables used in the country-level regres-sions. For vertical stratification in secondary education, the prevailing practice isto focus on external differentiation via tracking (i.e., the existence of differentschool types). Bol and Van de Werfhorst’s (2013) Educational Systems Data Set (ver-sion 4) provides an index of external differentiation that is based on the age of firstselection into different tracks (with lower ages corresponding to greater externaldifferentiation), the number of tracks available at age 15, and the length oftracked education as a proportion of the total duration of primary and secondaryeducation. We will also use this variable in the present study.What this measure may fail to capture, however, is that segregation accordingto student performance may occur through processes other than explicit tracking,for instance, because of residential segregation. To capture such processes, weneed a measure that is sensitive to school-level differences in (average) studentperformance within the same track. Such a measure is given by the proportion oftotal variance in student performance that is attributable to between-school dif-ferences, which the OECD regularly publishes in its PISA reports. More recent pub-lications often report its inverse (i.e., 1 minus the proportion of overall perfor-mance variance), which the OECD also refers to as the “index of vertical inclusion.”In these cases we simply inverted the measure again so that higher values con-sistently correspond to higher levels of vertical stratification. In order to reducemeasurement error, we averaged all available estimates from the 2000, 2003,2006, and 2009 PISA studies (i.e., we averaged estimates for different years and for– 11 –different domains such as reading, mathematics, and science) (OECD 2004, 2005,2007, 2011). We call this indicator of vertical stratification performance sortingindex.We use two different measures of horizontal stratification in terms of occupa-tion-specificity. Previous research (e.g., Bol and Van de Werfhorst 2011; Van deWerfhorst 2011) has often used the proportion of students in upper secondary ed-ucation who are in a vocational program (tracks). We also use this “vocational ori-entation index” (again obtained from version 4 of the Educational Systems Data Setby Bol and Van de Werfhorst, 2013). We cannot compute this index from the PIAACdata, because information on vocational education is subject to high proportionsof missing data in Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and theUnited States.There also exists a large literature that captures occupation-specificity using afourfold typology of systems of upper secondary education: apprenticeship systems,mixed systems, school-based vocational systems, and general systems (cf. Europe-an Centre for the Development of Vocational Training 2013; Müller 1994; OECD2000). The first three types can be characterized as occupation-specific, but differin the strength of employer involvement in the development of curricula, time forfirm-based training, and the standardization of vocational certificates. The degreeof occupation-specificity is generally supposed to be largest in apprenticeshipcountries and smallest in countries with general upper secondary education sys-tems. This classification suggests a different order of countries than the share ofstudents in vocational tracks (see Table A2 in the Appendix). For example, theCzech Republic and the Netherlands have higher shares of vocational educationenrolment than Germany or Denmark. Based on the vocational orientation index,the Czech Republic and the Netherlands—two countries with mixed systems—would thus be considered as being more occupation-specific than the apprentice-ship countries Germany or Denmark. We will use both indicators of occupation-specificity in our analysis as robustness check.Figure 1 displays the two measurements of vertical stratification and their re-lationship to the vocational orientation index. Two points are noteworthy. First,while both measures of vertical stratification are positively related to vocationalorientation index, the relationship is stronger for external differentiation (Sub-graph II) than for performance sorting (Subgraph I). This reflects the obvious factthat external differentiation grasps tracking in lower and upper secondary educa-tion and that some tracking is a necessary condition for having vocational tracksin upper secondary education. Second, the positive relationship between the twoindicators of vertical stratification and the vocational orientation index suggeststhat in many countries, the two institutional characteristics partly cancel eachother out when it comes to the size of the low-intermediate skills gaps. This sup-ports the idea that evidence for hypotheses 1a and 2a should be stronger whenincluding indicators of both characteristics simultaneously in the country-levelregression.– 12 –Figure 1.

We will also include this factor in our coun-try-level regressions. The underlying measurement of school’s instructional ca-pacity is based on information collected through the Grade 8 school principalquestionnaires of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).School principals indicated to what extent (4-point scale) their school’s capacity toprovide instruction was affected by shortages or inadequacies in 17 different do-mains. Following Park and Kyei (2011), we averaged principals’ responses to these17 items to obtain a measure of school resources and then computed the school-level Theil index to capture inequality. We constructed this measure for the 1995,1999, 2003, and 2007 TIMSS and averaged all available values for a given countryin order to reduce measurement error. Further information on the TIMSS studiesis available on at http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/. Column 10 in Appendix Table A2reports the values of the Theil index for our country sample. The Pearson correla-– 13 –tion between our measure and the corresponding measure reported by Park andKyei (2011) is 0.84 for the 13 countries that are included in both studies.We include two further control variables that were constructed from the PIAACdata. One is the proportion of 25-to-54-year-olds who were born in a foreigncountry and/or whose primary language is not that of the PIAAC test. As notedabove, we control for foreign-birth/foreign-language status at the individual lev-el. We additionally include the population share of adults to account for the possi-bility that countries with larger foreign-born/foreign-language populations mayhave higher levels of “ethnic” segregation at the school level (which would pre-sumably result in larger skills gaps).Finally, skills gaps among adults with different levels of education might part-ly arise from different participation rates in further training after leaving full-time education. Post-schooling opportunities may renew or enhance adult genericskills. Park and Kyei (2011:898) found that skills gaps are smaller in countries thatprovide more equal further education opportunities for adults with differentschool attainment (Park and Kyei 2011:898). We therefore control for the percent-age point difference in continuing education and training participation among 25-to-54-year-olds. For obvious reasons, the difference is calculated between adultswith ISCED 3-4 vs. 0-2 in the models of the lower and between ISCED 5-6 vs. 3-4 inthe models of the upper skills gap.Missing valuesIn a few cases, information on country-level variables is missing. The data set by<ref>Bol and Van de Werfhorst (2013) does not provide an external differentiation scorefor Estonia. The performance sorting measure is missing for France and the meas-ure of school-level resource inequality for France and Poland. Finally, the pointdifference in further training could not be estimated for Austria, because the vari-able on participation in further training is not included in the Austrian PIAACpublic use file. We used multiple imputation at the country level (10 imputationsusing predictive mean matching) to predict these missing values.– 14 –4.FindingsWe start with descriptive findings on country variation in the mean numeracyproficiency of educational groups and then continue by testing our hypotheses forthe lower and the upper skills gaps, respectively.Country variation in mean numeracy by educational degreeFigure 2 depicts the mean numeracy levels achieved by adults with different lev-els of educational attainment (see also Appendix Table A2). In all countries, themean numeracy score is lower for less educated adults than for those with inter-</ref>mediate levels of education, who in turn have lower means than those with col-lege education. Thus, unsurprisingly, in all countries we find a positive relation-ship between basic cognitive competences and certificates. Moreover, country var-iation in the mean numeracy level of all educational groups is quite substantial. Itis largest for less educated adults (ISCED 0-2), followed by the country differencesof intermediate (ISCED 3-4) and then higher (ISCED 5-6) educated adults.Figure 2. Mean numeracy levels by educational attainmentCountries are ordered by numeracy means of ISCED 0-2. For country abbreviations see Figure 1.Source: PIAAC 2012, authors’ calculations.– 15 –The mean competence level of less-educated adults is lowest in the US (162.6) andhighest in Finland (260.8). This difference corresponds to almost two competencelevels: The PIAAC framework distinguishes among six competence levels (belowlevel 1 to level 5)—with the intermediate levels 2-4 each spanning a range of 50points (OECD 2013:76). Another benchmark for putting these differences in per-spective is the standard deviation of numeracy scores for the full PIAAC sample(i.e., adults aged 16 to 65 from all participating countries), which is 51.3 points(OECD 2013:266).Country variation in the mean numeracy levels of intermediate educatedadults (ISCED 3-4) ranges from 239.5 points in the US to 284.2 points in the Neth-erlands. This still amounts to about 45 points. Country differences in the averagescore of higher educated adults (ISCED 5-6) are again smaller, but remain quitesubstantial—ranging from 280.2 in Spain to 314.3 in Belgium (about 34 points).To what extent these differences “translate” into country differences in skillsgaps, and whether educational stratification processes influence the size of thesegaps, will be investigated in the following.Low-intermediate numeracy gapsFigure 3 shows the results of our first step, that is, of the individual-level regres-sions of the low-intermediate numeracy gap for each of the 21 countries.Figure 3. Numeracy gap between adults with ISCED 3-4 vs. ISCED 0-2Countries are ordered according to the size of the adjusted lower skills gap. For country abbrevia-tions see Figure 1.Source: PIAAC 2012, authors’ calculations.– 16 –The figure displays the raw (unadjusted) and adjusted numeracy gaps betweenadults with low and intermediate levels of education (ISCED 0-2 vs. 3-4). Adjustednumeracy gaps are controlled for age, gender, an indicator for being below age 30and (still) in formal education, and foreign-birth/foreign language status.The unadjusted lower numeracy gap varies from only 19.8 points in Finland to76.9 points in the United States, a range of about 57 points. The adjusted lowernumeracy gap reaches a low of 14.2 points in Finland and a high of 57.0 points inthe Slovak Republic, a range of 42.8 points. This is still substantial, yet noticeablysmaller than for the raw gap, implying that compositional differences in the abovementioned individual characteristics account for a good portion of country varia-tion in the lower skills gap.In order to test hypotheses 1a and 2a, we now turn to the second step: thecountry-level regressions of adjusted numeracy gaps. We provide two tables: Table1 presents results without further country-level controls and Table 2 presentsresults with the controls included. We start with the results without controls,which are displayed in Table 1. All continuous predictors (i.e., all except the typol-ogy of upper secondary education systems) are standardized to have a mean ofzero and standard deviation of one, so the point estimates can be interpreted asthe expected increase in the lower numeracy gap for a standard deviation increasein the respective predictor.Models M1 – M4 show that without including indicators of both dimensions ofstratification simultaneously in the regression, only the performance sorting in-dex as one of the two indicators of vertical stratification is significant—and, asexpected, higher levels of performance sorting are associated with a larger lowerskills gap (model M1). The external differentiation index also has a sizable effect inthe expected direction, but is less precisely estimated. Coefficient estimates forthe two measures of occupational specificity generally have the expected sign, butare relatively small and far from reaching statistical significance (the sole excep-tion is the difference between general system and vocational schools systemcountries in model M4).Yet, given that occupation-specificity and vertical stratification are positivelycorrelated (see Figure 1 in Section 3) and presumably have opposite effects on thelower skills gap, the expected effects might begin to show or become reinforcedonce we include measures of both dimensions in the regression. Models M5 to M8in Table 1 confirm this expectation. These models include indicators of both insti-tutional characteristics simultaneously, but differ in the combination of indicatorsincluded.The models reveal that when controlling for occupation-specificity (regardlessof which of the two indicators is used), both the performance sorting and the ex-ternal differentiation index are significant and go in the expected direction: Thelower numeracy gap is larger in countries with higher sorting education systemsand the effect sizes are substantial: According to the estimates displayed in modelM5 (and M6), a standard deviation increase in performance sorting is associatedwith a 6.2 (or 4.8) point increase in the lower numeracy gap, when occupation-specificity is controlled via the vocational orientation index (or via the typology of– 17 –upper secondary education systems). The corresponding estimates for a standarddeviation increase in the external differentiation index are 8.4 (or 5.4) points (M7and M8). These results support hypothesis 1a.Table 1.

The effect of vocational orientation is neg-ative, as expected: The more upper secondary education emphasizes occupation-specific skills, the smaller is the low-intermediate numeracy gap. This result con-firms our hypothesis 2a. There is less support for the second measurement of oc-cupation-specificity “types of upper secondary education systems,” at least if con-– 18 –ventional standards of statistical significance are applied. The indicators for thedifferent systems are insignificant in all specifications. The directions of the ef-fects are mostly as expected, suggesting that the low-intermediate numeracy gapis larger in countries with a general system (the reference category) than in coun-tries with an apprenticeship system or vocational schools. The effect of “mixedsystems” is “wrongly” (i.e., positively) signed in some specification, but tends to bevery small.Before we move on to the regression results including our control variables,model M9 displays estimation results for the Theil index on between-school dif-ferences in instructional resources. In contrast to the findings of Park and Kyei(2011), the effect size is small (1.7) and not statistically significant (standard error2.32). The picture does not change substantially if we more closely follow Park andKyei and look at literacy (rather than numeracy) gaps or and/restrict the analysisto the age range 25-34 (Park and Kyei’s study was restricted to ages 26-35, whichwe cannot replicate exactly because the PIAAC data only provide five-year agegroups; these results are available upon request). Thus, with an improved meas-urement of basic competences (in PIAAC) and a different country sample, theirfinding cannot be replicated.Table 2 summarizes the same basic specifications as Table 1, but this time withadditional country-level control variables (between-school inequality, differencein adult training participation, share of foreign-born and/or foreign-language sta-tus). These models yield quite similar results. Both measures of vertical stratifica-tion are significant in models M5 and M7, but no longer attain statistical signifi-cance in models M6 and M8 (where occupation-specificity is captured via the ty-pology). However, the effect sizes in models M6 and M8 are similar to those in Ta-ble 1: The loss of statistical significance is attributable to a loss of precision (largerstandard errors) rather than smaller effect sizes (the latter in fact increase). Inmodels M5 and M7 (where occupation-specificity is captured via the vocationalorientation index), the effects of the stratification measures are (even) more ro-bust to the inclusion of additional controls. Taken together, these results providestrong support for hypothesis 1a.The vocational orientation index is again only significant in model M7 in Table2. Coefficient estimates for the typology of upper secondary education systemsmost clearly show the pattern predicted by hypothesis 2a when the external dif-ferentiation index and the additional country-level control variables are includedin the regression (model M8 in Table 2): The smallest skills gap can be found incountries with apprenticeship systems, followed by countries with mixed and vo-cational school systems, while countries with general secondary education sys-tems have, on average, the largest low-intermediate skills gap. On the whole, theempirical evidence for hypothesis 2a is thus somewhat less conclusive than forhypothesis 1a. Overall, however, the results do lend reasonable support to the ideathat greater occupation-specificity of upper secondary education is associatedwith smaller differences in (PIAAC) skills between adults with low and intermedi-ate formal qualifications. As for the role of between-school resource inequality– 19 –(captured by the Theil index), we still find no clear evidence for a positive associa-tion with the lower skills gap.Table 2.

Moreo-ver, the two indicators of vertical stratification do almost equally well explaincountry variation in the low-intermediate skills gap and neither is clearly prefer-able to the other.Finally, we follow the suggestion of Bryan and Jenkins (2013) to look for sub-stantively interesting outliers, especially in country comparisons consisting of– 20 –M55.5+(2.93)-3.0(2.10)1.3(2.50)4.6(2.91)1.6(3.36)38.7**(2.06)210.63M65.7(3.87)-6.0(7.07)1.5(7.03)-0.5(6.02)3.2(3.24)4.2(3.10)1.9(3.40)39.3**(4.05)210.628.3*(3.35)-5.7*(2.36)1.3(2.07)3.8(2.49)3.0(3.04)38.7**(1.80)210.707.2(4.68)-11.5(8.32)-4.3(7.47)-3.7(7.53)3.0(3.18)3.7(3.54)2.9(4.01)42.5**(6.26)210.621.0(2.17)6.3*(2.25)0.4(2.65)38.6**(2.10)210.40less than 30 cases: Figure 4 plots the residual numeracy gap for each countrybased on models M5 and M7 in Tables 1 and 2.5 Subgraph I plots the residuals fromthe regressions with the vocational orientation index and the performance sortingindex (models M5 in Tables 1 and 2).

Residuals from country-level regressions of numeracy gap betweenadults with ISCED 3-4 vs. 0-2 on measures of vertical stratification,vocational orientation, and control variablesNotes. Calculations based on Tables 1 to 2. For country abbreviations see Figure 1.Source: PIAAC 2012, authors’ calculations.A first result apparent from Figure 4 (Subgraphs I and II) is that accounting forcountry differences in occupation-specificity and vertical stratification (perfor-mance sorting or external differentiation index) substantially reduces cross-national variation in the (adjusted) lower numeracy gap. Whereas adjusted lower5 More precisely, the figure displays the average residual numeracy gap across the ten imputedcountry data sets (see Section 3).– 21 –numeracy gaps span a range of 42.8 points (cf. the discussion of Figure 3 above),the residuals from the country-level regressions without additional controls(filled triangles) span ranges of 32.8 points (vocational orientation and perfor-mance sorting indices, Subgraph I) and 28.4 points (vocational orientation and ex-ternal differentiation indices, Subgraph II).Adding the country-level control variables further reduces the country varia-tion (hollow triangles), to 23.7 points (Subgraph I) and 19.4 points (Subgraph II). Alook at Table 2 suggests that this is primarily due to the control variable “percent-age point difference in training participation between adults with low and inter-mediate levels of education”, because this is the control variable that has the larg-est effect. Like Park and Kyei (2011:898), we find that lower numeracy gaps tend tobe smaller in countries that show less inequality in opportunities between lessand intermediate educated adults to receive adult education and training.Second, looking at outliers (hollow triangles including the controls), we seethat for the performance sorting index, quite large residuals (more than 5 points)can be found for Finland and Korea in negative direction and Poland, France, theCzech and Slovak Republic in positive direction. For the external differentiationindex, substantial outliners are also Finland, Korea, Poland, and the Slovak Repub-lic, and differently, Austria, Japan, the UK, and the US. The latter three countriesare interesting, because these are countries which show a much lower degree ofvertical stratification in terms of external differentiation than of performancesorting. For the majority of country cases the two indicators of vertical stratifica-tion seem to perform similarly well, however.Intermediate-high numeracy gapsWe now turn to the upper numeracy gap. Figure 5 plots the (unadjusted and ad-justed) gap between adults with high (ISCED 5-6) and intermediate (ISCED 3-4) lev-els of education. Overall, we find somewhat smaller numeracy gaps than for thelower part of the educational distribution. In contrast to the lower numeracy gap,Figure 5 shows that compositional differences between adults with intermediateand high formal qualifications tend to explain only a small part of the of the uppernumeracy gap and therefore also do not account for much of the country differ-ences. The raw and adjusted numeracy gaps are very similar in all countries. Theadjusted numeracy gap is smallest in Italy (16.8 points) and highest in the US (51.0points), implying a range of 34.2 points.– 22 –Figure 5. Numeracy gap between adults with ISCED 5-6 vs. ISCED 3-4Countries are ordered according to the size of the adjusted upper skills gap. For country abbrevia-tions see Figure 1.Source: PIAAC 2012, authors’ calculations.The results for the impact of educational stratification processes on the interme-diate-high skills gaps can be briefly summarized. They are displayed in Table 3(without control variables) and Table 4 (including the control variables). None ofthe indicators of occupation-specificity and vertical stratification reaches statisti-cal significance in any specification. Moreover, the effect sizes are much smallerthan for the low-intermediate skills gaps. The only substantial difference, alt-hough not significant, can be found for the comparison of apprenticeship systemsversus general education systems (models M6 and M8 in Table 4). As expected, theupper skills gap tends to be larger in apprenticeship systems (where the interme-diate group invests heavily in occupation-specific skills and where the tertiaryeducated presumably are a more selective, academically inclined group). Overall,however, hypothesis 2b, which predicted this pattern to hold more generally, isnot confirmed. We also expected vertical stratification to be unrelated to the upperskills gap or even slightly negatively related to the upper skills gap (hypothesis1b). The coefficient estimates on both measures of vertical stratification (perfor-mance sorting and external differentiation index) are indeed not significant andtend to very small (and negative). This result supports our hypothesis.– 23 –Table 3.

This confirms our argument that it isimportant, first, to separately investigate the lower and upper parts of the educa-tional distribution and, second, to keep in mind that PIAAC is measuring basic cog-nitive competences.Moreover, as indicated in Table 4, inequality in adult education opportunities(% point difference in adult training participation between ISCED 5-6 vs. 3-4) ismuch less important for the upper than for the lower skills gaps. A plausible in-terpretation of these results is that adults with at least upper secondary educationhave mostly acquired the basic cognitive competences measured in PIAAC during– 24 –-1.9(1.50)32.7**(1.82)210.06schooling whereas training opportunities do provide a second chance of learningfor less educated adults.Table 4.

It does seem to be somewhat more strongly related tothe upper skills gap in the specifications in Table 4 (which include the other coun-try-level controls and different combinations of the measures of vertical stratifi-cation and occupational specificity): Here, the estimates do suggest that the upperskills gap is lower in countries with higher levels of between-school resource ine-quality in lower secondary education. In two specifications (models M2 and M5)this effect is significant at the ten percent level and model M1 it even reaches sig-nificance at the 5 percent level. Nonetheless, this finding contradicts the resultsby Park and Kyei (2011), whose results suggest that there is no clear or perhaps asmall positive relationship between school-level resource inequality and the up-per skills gap. Further research is needed to reconcile these divergent findings.– 26 –5.ConclusionsThe main goal of our paper was to investigate the importance of educational strat-ification processes for the relationship between certificates and competences, op-erationalized as skills gaps by educational attainment. We have chosen to displaythe results for numeracy, but the results for literacy are very similar (availableupon request). We explored the impact of two aspects of educational stratification:vertical stratification of lower secondary education (sorting by perfor-mance/ability) and occupation-specificity of upper secondary education.Our two-step approach of accounting for country differences in skills gaps bycompositional differences (individual-level regressions, first step) and institution-al differences (country-level regressions, second step) revealed interesting differ-ences for the lower and upper part of the educational distribution for each of thetwo steps.First, whereas a high portion of the country variation in the low-intermediateskills gap could be explained by compositional differences with respect to age,gender, migration/language background, and participation in education (under age30), this was not the case for country variation in the intermediate-high skills gap.Moreover concerning the impact of educational stratification processes, theresults for country variation in the lower skills gaps (between less and intermedi-ate educated adults) confirm our hypotheses: Higher levels of vertical stratifica-tion increase the lower skills gap (hypothesis 1a) and greater horizontal stratifica-tion in terms of occupation-specificity of upper secondary education reduces it(hypothesis 2a). As for the role of vertical stratification (hypothesis 1a), we couldnot determine to what extent it is due to differences in learning opportunities andto selection on the basis of pre-existing competence/ability. Nevertheless, our re-sults would seem to support the reflected-glory story—which posits a positiveeffect of more inclusive education systems for low-achieving students—ratherthan the big-fish-little-pond effect, which assumes a positive effect of ability-sorted educational environments (see Section 2). The confirmation of hypothesis2a is consistent with the idea that occupation-specific systems devote greater re-sources to the enhancement of occupation-specific skills (especially in upper sec-ondary education). Adults who have completed such programs therefore scorelower on the kinds of non-occupational general skills assessed in PIAAC. As pre-dicted, we also found that the effects of our different indicators of vertical andhorizontal stratification on the low-intermediate numeracy gap became strongerwhen both aspects of stratification were included in the regression. Both verticaland horizontal stratification are at work, but their effects partly cancel each otherout because they tend to be positively correlated, yet influence the lower skillsgap in opposite directions.As for the intermediate-high (upper) skills gap, we found some support for hy-pothesis 1b, which expected no (or, if at all, a negative) impact of vertical stratifi-cation on the upper skills gap. Hypothesis 2b predicted a larger upper skills gap incountries with occupation-specific upper secondary education due to higher selec-– 27 –tion into tertiary education. It was not confirmed. Nevertheless, specifications in-cluding further country-level control variables (Table 4) yielded a sizeable effectfor apprenticeship systems compared to other types of upper secondary educationsystem, even though it did not reach conventional significance levels. Given thatthere are only three apprenticeship countries in the sample (which of course lim-its statistical power), this may be seen as some indication that more occupation-specific and especially in apprenticeship systems are characterized by strongerselectivity of tertiary education attendance, which presumably drives up skillsdifferentials between adults with upper secondary and tertiary education.In sum, our main result is that the lower skills gap can be explained quite wellby compositional differences and by differences in educational stratification pro-cesses. Thus, in contrast to the argument by Park and Kyei (2011, see Section 1),stratification processes do account for a substantial part of the variation in thelow-intermediate skills gap. As in the study of Park and Kyei (2011), we also foundthat participation in adult education or, more precisely, the trainings gap betweenless and intermediate educated adults is related to the lower skills gap.Park and Kyei’s (2011) result that between-school resource inequality is a ma-jor predictor of the lower skills gap received much less support, however. Onepossible explanation for these divergent findings might be differences in samplerestrictions or the type of skills studied. Yet, as mentioned already in Section 3,our results do not change substantially when we mimic Park and Kyei’s studymore closely by including only the age group 25-34 and/or focusing on literacyrather than numeracy gaps. Another explanation could be differences in dataquality. For example, Park and Kyei (2011) found Germany to have a very smalllower skills gap in IALS, whereas in PIAAC the gap in Germany is among the larg-est (cf. Figure 3). We cannot rule out the possibility that these results reflect agenuine trend. However, problems with the IALS data for Germany (and a few oth-er countries) that have only recently become obvious (cf. Section 3) render thevalidity of the IALS-based estimate dubious and we are inclined to take the PIAAC-based one more seriously. On a more substantive level, it may also be important torecognize that school-level resource inequality is an ambiguous predictor. In par-ticular, resource inequality should be most likely to enhance between-studentinequalities if schools with above-average students also tend to have above-average resources. Conversely, if extra resources are targeted at disadvantagedschools or neighborhoods with low-performing students, resource inequalitymight well have equalizing effects. In other words: the level of school-level re-source inequality per se may be less important than how it is related to school-level student composition. Future research should attempt to develop measuresthat are capable of differentiating between these scenarios—something we couldnot do in this paper where the main focus was on educational stratification.As for the upper skills gap between intermediate and tertiary educated adults,none of the indicators of educational stratification had a clear effect and neitherhad the other country-level (control) variables. At best, we got some hints thatstronger selection into tertiary education in countries with apprenticeship sys-tems plays a role. We clearly need further studies that develop and test new ideas– 28 –how education systems shape differences in basic cognitive competences betweenadults with intermediate and higher degrees of formal qualification.Labor market implicationsAs a last point, we would like to discuss the relevance of our findings for broaderdiscussions about the interpretation of labor market returns to competences andeducational certificates. Given the easy availability of competence data fromPIAAC, new empirical analyses of the impact of (basic) competences and education-al certificates on labor market outcomes can be expected to mushroom during thenext few years. But how should we interpret the effects of skills and certificatesthat will be revealed in these analyses?A long-standing debate that our analysis speaks to is whether and to what ex-tent the well-documented positive relationship between educational attainmentand labor market outcomes such as wages reflects productivity differentials orrents. According to the productivity explanation (emphasized by human capital orsignaling theory; Becker 1964; Spence 1973), individuals with higher levels of ed-ucation have better labor market outcomes because they have more job-relevantskills than workers with lower levels of education. By contrast, the rent story ar-gues that educational certificates at least partly serve as devices that artificiallyrestrict access to jobs, thereby ensuring that the holders of credentials achievebetter labor market outcomes than they would if access were unrestricted (Collins1979; Sørensen 2000). These different ideas about education have stimulated asizable literature that seeks to identify the productivity and rent components ofthe effect of education on labor market outcomes (cf. Barone and Van de Werfhorst2011; Bowles and Gintis 2000, 2002). In 2011, the journal Research in Social Strati-fication and Mobility (Bills and Brown 2011) dedicated an entire special issue to thisquestion.Confronted with a regression that uses PIAAC to simultaneously estimate theimpact of educational certificates and skills on a labor market outcome, the moststraightforward response would perhaps be to interpret the net skills effect (con-trolled for certificates) as reflecting productivity differentials and the net certifi-cate effects (controlled for skills) as reflecting rents. This would only be appropri-ate, however, if the meaning of skills (as measured in PIAAC) and of certificates didnot vary across countries. Yet our results for the lower skills gap suggest that thisis the case (see also Bills 2003: 439).The clear negative relationship between occupation-specificity of upper sec-ondary education and the lower skills gap (hypothesis 2a) is indirect evidence thatthe intermediate group in more occupation-specific countries invests in occupa-tion-specific rather than in the basic general skills that were measured in PIAAC.This suggests that controlling for measured skills does not effectively removeskills differentials between workers (with respect to occupation-specific skills),particularly in occupation-specific systems. In addition to rent effects, the net ef-fects of educational certificates would thus capture differentials with respect tooccupation-specific skills—especially in countries where upper secondary educa-tion emphasizes these kinds of skills. Other things being equal, we would there-– 29 –fore expect to find larger net certificate effects on labor market outcomes in moreoccupation-specific countries, as Van de Werfhorst (2011) already did on the basisof the IALS data. Our results corroborate his interpretation that this pattern partlyreflects skills/productivity differentials (rather than only better opportunities forgenerating rents via occupational licensing in more occupation-specific coun-tries).The finding that the lower skills gap rises with the level of vertical stratifica-tion in lower secondary education (hypothesis 1a) may also have implications forthe labor market effects of educational credentials. In particular, this finding sug-gests that having completed (at least) an intermediate-level educational programis a better predictor of an individual’s actual level of skills in countries with high-er levels of vertical stratification. Theories of job-market signaling (Spence 1973)and statistical discrimination (Aigner and Cain 1977) suggest that this may en-hance certificate effects even net of actual individual-level skills: These theoriesargue that worker’s actual levels of skills or productivity are difficult to ascertainand that prospective employer will rely on formal educational credentials as alow-cost way of screening applicants. They should be especially likely to do so ifthe credentials are highly informative with respect to the applicant’s actual levelof skills, which our findings suggest is the case in vertically stratifying countries.This should amplify labor market effects of formal credentials even after control-ling for actual individual skills or ability.Future research should use PIAAC and similar data sets to empirically investi-gate this possibility. Research along those lines should examine the lower and theupper part of the educational distribution separately, as we found the impact ofvertical and horizontal stratification to be quite different for the lower and theupper skills gap. Researchers thus need to carefully consider not only that the re-lationship between competences and certificates differs across countries, but alsothat the processes generating this relationship differ between the upper and thelower parts of the educational distribution.– 30 –ReferencesAchen, Christopher H. 2005. “Two-Step Hierarchical Estimation: Beyond Regression Analy-sis.” Political Analysis 13(4):447–56.<ref>Aigner, Dennis.
