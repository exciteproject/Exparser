Interim Governments: Short-LivedInstitutions for Long-Lasting PeaceJulia StrasheimAfter the uprising against President Yanukovych, Ukraine’s opposition convened an in-terim government to pave the way for elections in May 2014. This year also saw inter-im governments put in place in the Central African Republic and Thailand. Meanwhile,peace talks in South Sudan came to a standstill in October 2014 because parties were un-able to agree on the role of the prime minister in an interim government.AnalysisInterim governments are often installed during peace processes, and policy makerstend to portray them as magic bullets that are capable of resolving all forms of violentconflict and promoting postconflict democracy. Their record, however, is mixed. Thisis partly because policy makers focus on distributing interim government seats amongconflict parties. It is just as vital, though, to ensure that interim governments implementcrucial reforms and integrate civil society in decision-making processes. Postconflict interim governments are set up to organize elections, conduct institu-tional reforms, and facilitate conflict resolution. They are particularly common insub-Saharan Africa, where they have been installed after over 60 percent of armedconflicts. The record shows that power-sharing interim governments, such as in Liberia, andinternational interim governments, such as in Kosovo, are most successful in ad-vancing peace and democracy.Among the most vital reforms interim governments need to implement is the inte-gration of the parallel institutions that warring parties maintain during armed con-lfict. As long as parties retain control over military structures or shadow adminis-trations, they will possess the resources to return to fighting.How interim governments are perceived by the broader public is also important. In-cluding civil society in decision making, such as when drafting a new electoral law,increases the acceptance of reforms.Keywords: Interim governments, transition, democratization, peace, conflict resolutionwww.giga-hamburg.de/giga-focusNumber 92014ISSN 2196-3940INTERNATIONALEDITIONEnglishInterim Governments as Tools for ConflictResolutionWhen promoting peace and democratization insocieties marked by internal violence, the inter-national community often calls for the installationof interim governments. Interim governments areinstitutions set in place to facilitate the transitionfrom an old regime to a new one, organize dem-ocratic elections, provide venues for conflict res-olution for the warring parties, and implementcrucial institutional reforms early on in the peaceprocess. They often convene after warring partieshave signed a peace agreement, but they can al-so form while fighting is still taking place. Interimgovernments typically cease to function with theholding of elections so that a new, “permanent”government can take over. Figure 1 shows that in-terim governments were common in postconflictpeace processes all over the world between 1989and 2012. This has been particularly evident insub-Saharan Africa, where interim governmentswere installed following over 60 percent of armedconflicts, including civil wars in Burundi, Libe-ria, and the Central African Republic (CAR). In-terim governments were also set up after roughly50 percent of armed conflicts in Europe, the Mid-dle East, South America and Central America aswell as after about 25 percent of armed conflictsin Asia.Policy makers, warring parties, and the me-dia have thus recently started to increasingly por-tray interim governments as “magic bullets” ca-pable of resolving all forms of violent conflict. Forinstance, in June 2012 the then US Secretary ofState, Hillary Clinton, stressed the need to create“a fully representative and inclusive interim gov-ernment which leads to free and fair elections” inSyria (The Telegraph 2012). In the final years of SriLanka’s civil war that ended in 2009, the Libera-tion Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) demanded thecreation of an internationally backed interim self-governing authority, but the government deniedthem such a request. And recently commenting onAfghanistan’s current struggle for peace, ForeignPolicy identified a new interim government evenas “the only choice left” (Koskinas 2014) for thecountry. Such a cure-all view on interim govern-ments is, however, somewhat paradoxical. Whilethey may help to resolve conflict in some cases,they also raise questions regarding the democraticlegitimacy of and impunity for actors involved inthe conduct of war:• First, interim governments are typically un-elected and thus democratically illegitimate in-stitutions that are put in place to promote de-mocracy, a system that thrives on elections todetermine its political leaders. Interim govern-ments have hence also been called “benevolentautocrats” (Chesterman 2004).Figure 1: Intrastate Armed Conflicts and Interim Governments, 1989–2012  Source: <www.ucdp.uu.se> for conflict data; own compilation of data for interim gov ernments.GIGA Focus International Edition/English 9/2014- 2 -• Second, interim governments are also regularlyperceived as bridges to peace and conflict reso-lution, but they are usually dominated by thoseactors that started the war in the first place. Itis not rare for the warring parties’ leaders, whoare often inexperienced in governing a state, toexploit their positions in interim governmentsto enrich themselves, instead of generating col-lective goods for the benefit of all members ofsociety.Despite these paradoxes, interim governmentswere also frequently put in place in 2014. InUkraine the fall of President Viktor Yanukovych’sregime in February after prolonged protests inKiev’s Independence Square brought an interimgovernment to power that was ruled by the for-mer opposition parties. Despite being in placeuntil Petro Poroshenko was elected president inMay 2014, the interim government did not resolveUkraine’s lingering political conflict. In March2014, after an internationally unrecognized in-dependence referendum and a Russian interven-tion, Russia recognized the Crimean Peninsula asa sovereign state. Shortly thereafter, violence esca-lated into a civil war in Ukraine’s eastern oblasts.In the Central African Republic (CAR) a nation-al transitional council was installed in January2014 after a prolonged armed conflict between theSéléka coalition and supporters of former presi-dent Francois Bozizé. Catherine Samba-Panza, themayor of the capital Bangui, became interim pres-ident. These political changes did not, however,resolve the country’s conflict, and United Nations(UN) troops were required to take over the peace-keeping mission in September 2014 in an atemptto stop the continued bloodshed. In South Sudanthe May 2014 peace accord called for the creationof an interim government. But peace talks wereat a standstill as of October 2014 because warringparty leaders have been unable to agree on inter-im cabinet positions. And in Thailand the armyset up a military interim government after over-throwing Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra’sregime in May 2014. Military rulers have prom-ised political reforms and democratic elections,though they are yet to materialize.The record for all of these 2014 interim govern-ments in promoting sustainable peace and democ-racy is thus mixed at best. When are interim gov-ernments instruments for peace and democracy?And when do they fail to keep their promises?The Institutional Design of InterimGovernmentsThus far, political science has almost exclusivelyanalyzed the institutional designs of interim gov-ernments by assessing how these bodies add topostconflict peace and democracy. This is basedon an influential typology that identifies whichpolitical elite actors dominate interim govern-ments and diferentiates between four institution-al designs: caretaker, revolutionary, power-shar-ing and international.Caretaker interim governments are ruled by theincumbent regime’s authoritarian elites. This wasthe case in Angola, for instance, where the incum-bent People’s Movement for the Liberation of An-gola (MPLA) were in power during the transition-al period between the signing of the Bicesse PeaceAgreement in 1991 and presidential elections in1992. The rebels of the National Union for the To-tal Independence of Angola (UNITA) were not in-cluded.If a regime is defeated by an opposition par-ty, however, the later may install a revolutionaryinterim government – as occurred in Libya in 2011.There Muammar Gaddafi’s regime was over-thrown by the rebel-ruled National TransitionalCouncil (NTC), which organized elections for theGeneral National Congress in July 2012.In a power-sharing interim government, incum-bent and new elites join forces, as was the case af-ter Liberia’s long-lasting civil war in 2003. And inan international interim government, internationalactors (commonly through the lead of the UN) as-sume political authority for a period of time – anexample of which is the establishment of the UNInterim Administration Mission in Kosovo at theturn of the millennium (Shain and Linz 1995).The record shows that power-sharing and in-ternational forms of interim governments (suchas those in Liberia and Kosovo, respectively) aremore successful in promoting postconflict peaceand democratization than are caretaker and rev-olutionary designs (like those set up in Ango-la and Libya, respectively), which exclude one ofthe warring factions. This is because, among oth-er things, interim power sharing ofers all relevantwarring party leaders a position in political oficeand thus assures them that they will not be dom-inated or marginalized in the peace process. Fur-thermore, a seat in an interim cabinet or parlia-ment is at times viewed to be more lucrative thanGIGA Focus International Edition/English 9/2014- 3 -is continuing to fight for political power on thebatlefield. For instance, Foday Sankoh, leader ofSierra Leone’s Revolutionary United Front (RUF)rebel movement, is said to have signed the 1999Lomé Peace Agreement in exchange for the vicepresidency and control over the national diamondtrade (Binningsbø and Dupuy 2009). Interim rulein Sierra Leone ended with elections in May 2002,and civil war has not recurred. In Angola, on theother hand, UNITA received no seats in the care-taker interim government and thus had no reasonto believe that the government could deliver freeand fair elections. After UNITA’s Jonas Savimbilost to José Eduardo dos Santos of the MPLA inthe 1992 presidential elections, the rebels remobi-lized for civil war.While power-sharing interim governments canthus often lure warring factions into peace by of-fering certain benefits, international interim gov-ernments come instead with capacity or coer-cion. Due to their greater technical knowledge aswell as financial and human resources, UN inter-im governments (“transitional administrations”)are, in theory, often beter equipped than internal-ly conflictual power-sharing interim governmentsto rebuild state institutions. International interimgovernments also often possess suficient militarymanpower via peacekeeping missions to ensurewarring parties comply. For example, internation-al authority has prevented the recurrence of civilwar in Bosnia, where the Ofice of the High Rep-resentative is allowed to dismiss domestic leadersfrom political ofice if they are seen to be pursuingan ethnonationalist agenda.The Bosnian case, however, points to prob-lematic aspects of international interim rule thatare often dismissed as illegitimate, undemocraticor neocolonial forms of postconflict governance.Furthermore, UN administrations typically suferfrom operational deficiencies such as being veryslow to deploy and lacking the necessary culturaland/or linguistic skills to rule a foreign territory.Also, international interim governments are oftencriticized for imposing Western ideas of democ-racy in postconflict societies in the Global South– particularly in cases where reforms are imple-mented with low levels of local ownership overthe process. For instance, the UN administrationestablished in East Timor in 1999 did not initial-ly intend assign any executive or legislative pow-er to the East Timorese political elites. Only in Au-gust 2000, after political elites protested againstthe lack of influence they had over East Timor’stransition to independence, did the UN create theEast Timor Transitional Administration (ETTA)– a body that represented the structure of EastTimor’s government following the cessation of theinterim government.These issues already point to the many chal-lenges faced by international interim govern-ments. But power-sharing interim governmentsalso have to deal with dificulties. In fact, manypower-sharing interim regimes installed between1989 and 2012 failed to deliver sustainable peaceand democratization (e.g., the Democratic Repub-lic of the Congo [DRC] and Burundi). Althoughthere are many reasons for this, one explanationsuggests that power-sharing interim governmentsare seen to reward the use of violence with a seatin political ofice, which then motivates formerlyunarmed groups to take up arms in order to al-so receive a seat in interim government (Tull andMehler 2005).Another problem with focusing on power shar-ing and internationalization as the key reasons forinterim governments’ success or failure is thatwhile these factors may be strong explanations ofshort-term peace, they often cannot explain long-term, sustainable peace or postconflict democra-tization. For instance, if power-sharing interimgovernments contribute to peace by ofering war-ring parties interim cabinet seats, what happensonce elections take place and a new, postinterimgovernment takes over? It is likely that the for-mer interim governors will refuse to accept beingstripped of political power and relegated to theopposition, thus threatening to return to war. Thiswas, in fact, what occurred in Cambodia follow-ing the defeat of Hun Sen, the leader of the Cam-bodian People’s Party (CPP), by Prince NorodomRanariddh in the 1993 elections. After two years asprime minister of the power-sharing, interim Su-preme National Council, Hun Sen and the CPP re-fused to accept defeat and forced their way intoa coalition government with Ranariddh – a movemade possible by the fact that the CPP had neverrelinquished control of the security services andalso controlled civil administration structures inmuch of rural Cambodia.GIGA Focus International Edition/English 9/2014- 4 -Institutional Reforms in Interim GovernmentsBecause of the aforementioned issues, it would befruitful to take into account explanations of thesuccess or failure of interim governments that gobeyond the presence of power sharing or interna-tional actors. Just as important as the “static” in-stitutional design of interim governments are the“dynamic” features of these governments (i.e., thetype of reforms that they conduct). The Cambo-dia example shows how crucially important it isto address early on in a peace process the paral-lel political and military institutions that warringparties create or maintain during armed conflict.In fact, in most armed conflicts today warring fac-tions establish more or less institutionalized andmilitarized “shadow governments” in order to ac-cumulate the resources needed to engage in war.Together with nonstatutory rebel armies, theseparallel structures do not automatically disap-pear just because, for instance, a peace agreementis signed and an interim government is installed.Even in cases like Kosovo, where the mass exodusof Serbian bureaucratic personnel led to an insti-tutional vacuum in the formal state structures af-ter the end of the war, informal Albanian-run par-allel institutions had long been in place – name-ly, a shadow government run (for over a decade)by the unarmed opposition party, the Democrat-ic League of Kosovo, and a self-proclaimed inter-im government run by the Kosovo Liberation Ar-my (and set up before the UN installed its own in-terim administration in June 1999).Thus during a peace period, interim govern-ments must promptly look to integrate the parallelpolitical and military institutions of warring par-ties. These institutions enable such factions to re-main organized and tax a population, which pro-vides them with finances to purchase weapons inthe event they lose elections and decide to preventtheir political elimination by force. In the above-mentioned case of Angola, for instance, UNITAnever allowed the MPLA caretaker interim gov-ernment access to its districts, therefore prevent-ing electoral registration being carried out in theseareas. Wherever the interim government tried toexpand its territorial outreach in UNITA strong-holds, UNITA rebels atacked and/or kidnappedgovernment oficials, thus forcing them to canceltheir electoral registration eforts. When UNITA’sSavimbi lost the 1992 elections to the MPLA’s deSantos, he was able to quickly regroup his party– primarily in the communes and municipalitiesthat UNITA had never handed over to the interimgovernment. Similarly, in Cambodia the 1991 Par-is Peace Agreement did not require a strong com-mitment by the warring parties to disband theirmilitary structures, but rather only that the fac-tions agreed to disarm and demobilize before orshortly after the elections and to abide by the de-cisions of the subsequently elected government.But these terms were never strongly enforced, andthe disarmament process was never completed.Consequently, not only was Hun Sen able to forcehis way into power despite losing the 1993 elec-tion, but Khmer Rouge rebels were able to contin-ue their struggle against Hun Sen’s governmentuntil 1998.In contrast, the reforms implemented in Nepaldemonstrate how an interim government’s mo-nopolization of power can increase its impact onpostconflict peace. During Nepal’s ten-year-longcivil war, the Maoist rebels controlled up to 75percent of the national territory. They used theirstrongholds to set up people’s courts and peo-ple’s governments, to extract taxes from the ru-ral population, and to force villagers to provideinsurgents with food and accommodation. Whenthe Maoists signed Nepal’s Comprehensive PeaceAgreement in November 2006, they agreed to dis-band their parallel structures upon joining the in-terim institutions. The new inclusive interim par-liament convened in January 2007, and a completedissolution of the people’s courts and govern-ments was reported for February the same year.Although the subsequent peace process in Nepalhad and still has to overcome many obstacles (e.g.,a thorough reform of the country’s security sec-tor is necessary), the country has thus far not re-turned to civil war.Elite Afairs and More Inclusive ProcessesThe role of interim governments is not solely toafect the behavior and perceptions of the leadersof warring parties. Equally important is how theyengage the broader public, especially civil societyorganizations, in postconflict societies. The inclu-sion of the public in processes of institutional re-form (e.g., amending the constitution or draftingnew electoral laws) can widen the acceptance ofsuch reforms and increase their sustainability andlegitimacy. For those people or groups that haveGIGA Focus International Edition/English 9/2014- 5 -been excluded from a reform process conductedby an elite few or marginalized by the decisionsof interim leaders, violent revolt may become a le-gitimate strategy to stop or reverse such process-es and decisions. Therefore, interim governmentsthat consult with civil society during reform pro-cesses are likely to be more successful in contrib-uting to sustainable peace and durable democrati-zation than are interim governments that are mereelite afairs.We can see this, for example, in Afghanistan af-ter the US-led international intervention in 2001.The Afghan Interim Authority (AIA) was put inplace by the December 2001 Bonn Agreement.The AIA, under the guidance of President HamidKarzai, was charged with drafting the country’snew post-Taliban constitution and electoral law.But although the institutions of the AIA includeda broad spectrum of Afghanistan’s ethnic and so-cial groups, the lawmaking process was essential-ly closed to broader and inclusive public debate.The AIA presented the electoral law to the popu-lation largely as a done deal and was consequent-ly perceived as mostly serving the interests of theinterim power brokers. On the contrary, the 2003–2005 National Transitional Government in Liberiaallocated posts not only to the former ruling Na-tional Patriotic Party (NPP) and the rebel groupsLiberians United for Reconciliation and Democra-cy (LURD) and Movement for Democracy in Li-beria (MODEL), but also to other political partiesand civil society groups. Instead of a rebel lead-er, Gyude Bryant, a civilian and businessman, wasnamed interim president. Even though this consti-tutes a much more comprehensive and seeminglysustainable institutional reform process than thatin Afghanistan, it also proved dificult for civil so-ciety members in Liberia to serve both as formalrepresentatives in the interim bodies and to per-form their roles as watchdogs over the politicalprocess.Interim Governments and German ForeignPolicyWhat conclusions can be drawn from the abovediscussion for the interim governments installed(and those yet to be convened) in 2014? And whatrecommendations can be made for German andinternational policy makers that are likely to pro-mote interim governments to help resolve futurearmed conflicts?In Ukraine the outbreak of violence may havebeen prevented if the interim government had notbeen presented as a political “clean break” withthe former regime. An original plan for the transi-tion of Ukraine proposed by German foreign min-ister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his counter-parts from Poland and France included a power-sharing interim government of national unity thatwould have been composed of both the opposi-tion and members of Viktor Yanukovych’s regime.Instead, the regime was toppled, and the opposi-tion’s interim government (atempting to reformthe civil administration) swiftly dismissed a num-ber of long-seated bureaucrats and tried to imposea bill that aimed to make Ukrainian the sole statelanguage – threatening Russian-speaking Ukrai-nians in the country’s eastern oblasts, which wereYanukovych strongholds. A more inclusive tran-sition process that had beter taken into consid-eration voices from eastern Ukraine would haveadded to national reconciliation.The above discussion also shows that pow-er sharing alone often cannot explain the successor failure of interim governments. In South Su-dan warring party leaders signed a peace accordin May 2014. These leaders, however, continue to-day to fight over cabinet posts, with each warringfaction stressing its right to lead the interim gov-ernment. Similarly, the change in the CAR’s staf-ing policy that came with Catherine Samba-Pan-za’s appointment as interim president in January2014 did not change the situation on the ground:violence remains a daily threat in the country.Equally important to the question of who runs theinterim government is what reforms the interimgovernment implements. Both Salva Kiir, currentpresident of South Sudan, and Catherine Sam-ba-Panza addressed the UN General Assemblyin September 2014 to appeal to the member statesto strengthen the UN peacekeeping operations intheir respective countries – in part because inter-im governments require substantial internation-al support to disarm and demobilize combatants.In the CAR the interim government is becomingmeaningless outside the capital Bangui. It has nocontrol of the country’s North, where former pres-ident Michel Am-Nondokro Djotodia has formeda parallel government in the city of Birao. The ex-perience of Angola (as discussed above) rendereda reform process unlikely and impeded the hold-GIGA Focus International Edition/English 9/2014- 6 -ing of elections (as currently planned) in Febru-ary 2015, not least because electoral registrationrequires control over the national territory.Lastly, in Thailand the interim National Coun-cil for Peace and Order (NCPO) of Prime MinisterPrayuth Chan-ocha, and then head of the army,was criticized in September 2014 in an AmnestyInternational report that accused it of systematichuman rights violations. The allegations includearbitrary arrests and the restriction of freedom ofexpression and assembly. Amnesty Internation-al claims that such restrictions are unfavorable toan inclusive institutional reform process as well asnational reconciliation. The situation in Thailandis that without consulting civil society in the insti-tutional reform process, Thailand’s interim lead-ers are risking a hard landing: not only will re-forms not supported by civil society be unsustain-able, but an exclusive interim period might pro-mote further unrest in the country.In general, international actors engaged inpostconflict democracy promotion and peace-building have in the past often paid much aten-tion to distributing seats in the interim govern-ment among political leaders. This is, however, of-ten not enough to ensure that an interim govern-ment succeeds in securing long-term peace andsustainable democracy. German and internation-al policy makers should therefore strive to equipinterim governments with the capacity to com-plete much-needed reforms before elections takeplace – for instance, by supporting UN peacekeep-ing missions that can help to disarm and demobi-lize rebel groups. Furthermore, civil society actorsand unarmed opposition parties should be givenstronger roles in interim governments. The exam-ple of Liberia, however, where such actors haveeven been rewarded with seats in the interim par-liament, shows that such inclusion may not al-ways be the best approach. Instead, policy mak-ers could encourage interim governments to allowfor public debates and implement transparent re-form processes by, for example, holding referendaon newly drafted constitutions.References<ref>Binningsbø, Helga Malmin, and Kendra Dupuy(2009), Using Power-Sharing to Win a War: TheImplementation of the Lomé Agreement in Sier-ra Leone, in: Africa Spectrum, 44, 3, 87–107.</ref>Chesterman, Simon (2004), You, The People: TheUnited Nations, Transitional Administration, andState-Building, Oxford: Oxford University Press.<ref>Koskinas, Ioannis (2014), The Only Choice Left forAfghanistan, online: <htp://southasia.foreign-</ref>left_for_afghanistan> (27 October 2014).Shain, Yossi, and Juan Linz (eds) (1995), BetweenStates.
