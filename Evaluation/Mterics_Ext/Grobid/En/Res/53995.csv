Thus, this study aimed to estimating the prevalence of venous leg ulcersamong adults treated at the Victoria da Conquista Health Centre - BA and identifysociodemographic factors, health and wound characteristics and its treatment associatedwith this event.J. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. jul./set. 7(3):2659-26692660ISSN 2175-5361Oliveira SB, Soares DA, Pires PS.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2015.v7i3.2659-2669Prevalence of venous…METHODThis article comes from a larger study called the "characteristics of patients withlower limb ulcers treated at a health center in the countryside of Bahia, 2011," in whichmultiple health outcomes were investigated.There was conducted in a Health Center (CS) located in the city of Vitoria daConquista, in the Southwest of Bahia. This is the only Municipal outpatient specialized andreference to patients with chronic lesions, consisting of a multidisciplinary team, amongthem, a medical specialist, nurses and nursing technicians. There were registered in theservice during the period of data collection about 800 patients, this number refers to bothindividuals followed by the specialized service, and by individuals who perform episodiccontacts with the same for the execution of dressing less complex or withdrawal points.Health Center meets from patients with chronic ulcers or difficult treatment referred fromthe Family Health Units and other health centers, as well as patients from spontaneousdemand. Patients with higher morbidity or complications of other comorbidities such asdiabetes mellitus are referred to hospitals.The sample was non-probabilistic, random and without repetition, and for obtainingwere approached all eligible patients in the study of the occurrence period (January toMarch 2011) that met the following criteria: patients had lower limb ulcers, over 18 yearsold, in attendance in CS the dressing rooms in the period of data collection. There wereexcluded those with ulcers in another part of the body other than the lower limbs and thosewho were not in the CS to perform curative but due to other reasons.The interviews were conducted by researchers in every day and functioning of theservice hours and occurred at the time that individuals awaiting service, when theimpossibility of doing so in the same day, a new schedule is made for the nearest day forattendance at the CS, a fact that happened to one individual. Thus, all 43 individualsaddressed expressly agreed to participating in the study by signing the Informed ConsentForm (ICF) and the refusal rate was zero.Just prior to data collection a pre-test was conducted in order to verifyinginstrument feasibility and conditions for conducting research. The individuals interviewed inthis phase were not included in the final study sample.To obtaining data we used a structured form; it contained sociodemographicvariables (gender, age, education, marital status, color/race, income, living arrangementsand place of residence); health variables: (hours of sleep per night, physical mobility, pain,type 2 diabetes, hypertension and chronic venous insufficiency); and variables on thehistory and treatment of the wound: (wound start time, presence of wound recurrence,number of wounds, frequency of exchange of toppings and place of the healing).The above variables were used as potential factors associated with venous ulcers.The etiological hypothesis of the wound, the dependent variable in this study was obtainedJ. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. jul./set. 7(3):2659-26692661ISSN 2175-5361Oliveira SB, Soares DA, Pires PS.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2015.v7i3.2659-2669Prevalence of venous…through self-report and dichotomized as venous ulcers and not venous ulcers. Although somestudies have been based on clinical judgment of the lower limbs and established a set ofclinical indicators for classification of venous ulcers, we decided to using the self-reportvalidated by the diagnostics of medical records, since there was no difference between thisand the diagnosis prior.There were interviewed 43 people, and from this total there was excluded 1 (2,32%)individual who did not answer the question on the etiological hypothesis of the wound andwhich was not found diagnosis in the medical record.The analytical plan included the estimation of the prevalence of types of ulcersstratified by sex and for all individuals, using both descriptive statistical procedures. For theanalysis of associated factors (sociodemographic variables, health and variables related tothe history and treatment of the wound) the venous ulcers, the chi-square test of Pearsonor Fisher exact tests were performed. Were considered statistically significant differencesless than or equal to 5% (p = 0,05). The data collected was used Epi Info software version3.5.3 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA).The research was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Municipal HealthSecretariat of Vitoria da Conquista – BA; and by the Research Ethics Committee of the StateUniversity of Southwest Bahia (UESB), under Opinion No 199/2010 and CAAE: 0033.0.454000-10. All individuals have expressed agreement with the free and informed consent (IC) andsigned it.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA prevalence of 83,3% of venous ulcers and 17,7% of non-venous ulcers (15,3% ofneurotrophic ulcers and 2,4% of traumatic ulcers) for the general population was found.When stratified by gender, we identified a higher prevalence of venous ulcers amongwomen (95,5%) and the lowest prevalence of ulcers in this other sex too (4,5%) comparedwith men (FIGURE 1).J. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. jul./set. 7(3):2659-26692662ISSN 2175-5361Oliveira SB, Soares DA, Pires PS.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2015.v7i3.2659-2669Prevalence of venous…Figure 1- Distribution of the sample according to kinds of ulcers,according to sex and to the total population.

However, the predominance in males also have a tendency is observed in someregional studies7,9 confirming that this situation is not only characteristic of women.When analyzing the factors associated with venous ulcers, it was observed that somesociodemographic and health characteristics may be contributing to the construction ofthe profile of patients affected by this type of ulcers. Among the sociodemographicfactors, beyond sex, family arrangement was the only one that remained associated withvenous ulcers. Higher prevalence of this disease in women has also been mentioned inother studies.5,8,14 A plausible explanations for the association between living together andthe presence of venous ulcers may be related to greater responsibility in caring for thefamily and housework14, and therefore less time for self-care, however, this associationneeds further investigation.Among the surveyed morbidity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic venousinsufficiency constitute relevant associations before countless other factors that mayinfluence the onset of venous ulcers and depict the importance of both the control as thetreatment of these morbidities. Higher proportion of patients with chronic venousinsufficiency was found among those who had venous ulcers in this study, which confirmsprevious study which showed that venous ulcers match 70-90% of all leg ulcers16. Thechronic venous insufficiency can bring aesthetic and functional complications and its mostexuberant manifestation venosa6 ulcer. It is engaged with the increase in venous pressure,which damages the hair and make it more permeable, allowing the exit of severalmolecules, generating eczema caused by the degradation of hemoglobin; edema due to theaccumulation of interstitial fluid, hyperpigmentation and lipodermatosclerosis.6,15 In thosecircumstances, a venous ulcer can be developed either using a light trauma, such as due toa collision with a mobile, or even spontaneously.1,17Regarding diabetes mellitus, its absence was associated with higher prevalence ofvenous ulcers. It is important reporting that these findings are consistent with the lowfrequency of venous ulcers due to causes such as diabetes.5 This finding may also be partlyattributed due to the sample size. In line with the above, about 20% of diabetic patientsdevelop lower limb ulcers at some point in their lives and their development may beassociated with both neuropathic and vascular changes.18 Diabetic neuropathy, chroniccomplication of this disease, can lead the decrease or loss of tactile, thermal, painful,J. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. jul./set. 7(3):2659-26692665ISSN 2175-5361Oliveira SB, Soares DA, Pires PS.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2015.v7i3.2659-2669Prevalence of venous…anhidrosis and atrophy of various peripheral regions of the body, due to autonomic nervousimpairment and motor18. In vascular disorders, atherosclerosis is responsible for thepathophysiological process of obstruction and arterial ischemia.17,18The association between the occurrence of pain and the presence of venous ulcers iswell established and is in agreement with other studies.19,20 The painful component canrepresent as well as an exacerbation of the inflammatory phase and delay the healingprocess21, an important factor actor in the quality of life of individuals with venousulcers.10,16Regarding the history of the wounds, the highest prevalence of individuals withvenous ulcers were found among those who had more than 10 years of start of the first ulcerand among those who had recurrence of the wound, which denotes a situation of chronicwounds, these findings also indicated in other studies.9,22,23 This situation can still picture agreater demand for health services both with regard to the mobilization of human, materialand structural as well as the impact this has on the quality of life of individuals affected,requiring greater health care.7 Nevertheless, the fact of the individuals come from areferral center for the treatment of wounds, may represent greater complexity of thelesions, explaining in part the results.It is noteworthy that, with regard to the treatment to the healing of venous ulcersand improves venous return, it is recommended that it should be provided by doctors,nurses and other professionals with the joint participation of the patient, withcompression therapy one of the pillars,6,15 with a view to reducing edema and venousstasis.7 Yet, regarding the treatment of venous ulcers, although not statisticallysignificant, most patients reported using the Health Center and the home to carry out theroofing trade. Like most of venous ulcers can recur in up to 70% of cases3,7, and all thecases that had relapsed venous ulcers in this study, the use of the Health Center and thehousehold as care environments may reflect this need to equip the individuals’ conditionsand knowledge to receive care and self-care. However, it is known that thedecentralization of care for the individual to perform the dressing in his home, it involvesfrom the availability of staff to conduct the training of customers, to the receptivity of thesame, will, and, above all, in preparation to realize it, and also permeating the discussionson health about the cost-effectiveness of clean and sterile techniques, the use ofantiseptics and frequency of exchanges of coverage depending on the needs of each woundand their vectors.Because they are venous ulcers so prevalent in the analyzed context, they requireexpensive and prolonged treatment and have shocked the quality of life of their patients, itis urgent that health services are prepared for the effective care of this clientele and thathealth professionals are properly trained and trained to work in an interdisciplinary,competent and safe manner.J. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. jul./set. 7(3):2659-26692666ISSN 2175-5361Oliveira SB, Soares DA, Pires PS.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2015.v7i3.2659-2669Prevalence of venous…CONCLUSIONThe results showed that venous ulcers are common health problems among adults inascribed rated service and the associated factors such as gender, living arrangements, type2 diabetes mellitus, chronic venous insufficiency, pain and time of beginning of the firstulcer are consistently observed at other national-scale studies. These findings areconfigured as input for the preparation of planning, prevention and treatment relevant tothis subject in order to enhancing the chances of successful treatment, contributing to thereduction of recidivism, healing without complications, reduced spending improving thehealth and quality of life.However, a limitation highlights the difficulty of cross-sectional studies inestablishing temporal relationship, because of the exposure and the outcomes are measuredsimultaneously. The fact that the response variable have been based on self-report,although less accurate than the clinical evaluation of the ulcer, had the advantage of beinginexpensive and more likely to be replicated with large samples.In this light, there is the importance of further research in different scenarios andwith more representative samples in order to improving national records about venousulcers and other etiologies and enable strategies to ensuring better health care based onscientific evidences and substantial clinics.J. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. jul./set. 7(3):2659-26692667ISSN 2175-5361Oliveira SB, Soares DA, Pires PS.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2015.v7i3.2659-2669Prevalence of venous…REFERENCES1. <ref>Dealey C.
