IntroductionProcess-produced micro data today play an important role in research in socialscience (cf. Jacobebbinghaus 2007). They are suitable for a broad range ofresearch objects like research on organizations, administrative processes, em-ployment biographies or special sub-population in a society (cf. Scheuch 1977:22 et sqq.; Bick, Mann, Müller 1984; Schmähl, Fachinger 1994: 179 et sqq.;Bick, Müller 2002: 230; Wallgren 2007: 4). Process produced data are definedas data that are generated by diverse (administrative) processes and represent adocumentation of different actions (cf. Scheuch 1977: 25).The linkage between the administrative process and the data it generates im-plies that process-produced data necessarily are limited to a specific purpose. Inorder to overcome these natural limitations in the process generated data acombination of data from different data sources (and administrative processes)is necessary. At a first glance this data integration and consolidation processmight look similar and typical for the development of research datasets.

In the following we want to present as an example the research datagenesis of the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) data base that trans-forms and integrates data originating on the operational level of the appropriateadministrative process of the Federal Employment Agency (BA) to datasetsthat are well fitted for research.The above mentioned problems are not only technical but also methodologi-cal problems. The integration of data stemming in case of the IAB data from atleast four different fields of administrative processes, two different institutionsand, coming with that, minimum four different operational IT-systems1 requiresa dealing with inconsistencies in the data. So the methodological problem ofhow to deal with not integrated and inconsistent process generated data whencreating a integrated research data base will be discussed and two divergingsolutions will be presented.All this information high lightens the background of the IAB data base andprovides necessary knowledge for the usage of process produced data in gen-eral and especially the IAB research data, contributing to a better understandingof the data and data production process as it is proposed by Bick and Müller(1984: 145; cf. Wallgren 2007).Before describing the data generation and the resulting problems the IAB re-search data base will be presented to ensure a better understanding of the fol-lowing problems. This integrated research data base can serve as an examplefor integrated process data bases of various sources and fields.2. Data Base of the Case Study: The IAB dataThe IAB research data base consists in general of four different data sourcesand administrative processes covering the four main fields of the German labormarket. These four fields are (a) employment, (b) job-search, (c) unemploy-ment benefit recipience (unemployment insurance and basic income support)and (d) active labor market policies. The data are collected in different andautonomous operational IT-systems.1 In fact many more operational IT-systems were and currently are in use by the BA toadminister and register process data, but we use in this article only the three main ones usedfor BA-based research data.2162.1 General Problems Arising When Integrating DataIn a first step the data of each data source are consolidated and for each datasource a research data product is generated. In a second step these differentdata sources are integrated to one data set. This large and comprehensive re-search data base is called the Integrated Employment Biographies (IEB). In thelast years many analyses of a broad range of aspects of the German labor mar-ket were based on the IEB. For more details on the IEB and the access to thisdata set, see Jacobebbinghaus 2007.For a broader understanding of the presented IAB-data the four main datasources will be briefly introduced. Job-seeking data, unemployment benefitrecipient data and data on measures of active labor market policy programsstem from the Federal Employment Agency itself and its operational IT-systems. These data are produced in the appropriate administrative processes.They are registered on the operational level in the belonging IT-system andthen stored in the central pool of BA-business data. This data pool provides thedata which are transformed and integrated by the IAB in order to build up itsresearch data base.In this process a whole set of problems can arise that also can be found inmany other data integration processes. Some important problems are discussedin the following:- Inconsistent information for one person: It is important to notice that thereis nearly no cross-validation of information between the different opera-tional IT-systems during the registration process. Therefore inconsistent in-formation for one person (e.g. differences in nationality) can be registered.- Identifier (ID) of a person: A second dimension of the autonomy of thedifferent IT-systems is related to the identifier (ID) of a person. DifferentIT-systems and administrative processes do have different identifiers so thatone person may have two or more identifiers.- Data Structure: In principle the data structure in all data sources is similar.All the data are spell data. But coverage and composition of these spell datadiffers between the data sources. For example a spell in the data comingfrom the social insurance system maximal covers one year, whereas spellsstemming from the unemployment benefit recipient system might be muchlonger.- Time-Span Covered: The maximum time span covered in the data dependson the underlying administrative process. Some data sources already existfor decades, reaching back to the 1970s. This results in manifold problemsthat can cause breaches in the long time-series, like changes in legislation orthe IT-systems, etc.- Different Target Populations: The administrative processes providing thedata are focussed on their special purpose and therefore target a specificgroup of persons. This implies that only information relevant for that purpo-se are registered and even further, that the meaning of the information is col-217lected purpose-dependent. Therefore in the process generated data see-mingly similar attributes might have different, process dependent values andmeanings.2.2 Data StructureThe three BA-related data sources use the BA-client-number (KNR) as themain identifier for a person. The data consist of spell data, which means indi-vidual, daily and historical information, that show the different states of infor-mation over time. Included are client characteristics and different administra-tive purpose dependent information (e.g. target job in job-seeking information,amount of unemployment benefits per time period in unemployment benefitrecipience, etc.).In the case of job-seeking data this means individual, daily and historical in-formation covering the time period since 2000 up to today, the different statesof job-search and information about personal attributes like sex, date of birth,reasons for job-search, target job, etc.Data stemming from the administration of active labor market policy pro-grams also consist of individual, daily and historical information covering thetime period since 2000 up to today. Information about personal attributes likesex, date of birth and information about the participation in the measure ofactive labor market policy is provided (e.g. duration of participation, outcome,etc.). Nearly all existing measures of active labor market policy since 1999 arecovered in the data.A significant longer time series can be found in the unemployment benefitrecipient data. Here the spell data go back to 1975, so that more than 30 yearsare covered. The data show information about the unemployment insurancesystem. This means that only persons that were employed for a certain amountof time before becoming unemployed can be found in the data. The data showon a daily basis client characteristics, information about benefit recipience (e.g.amount of transfer per period), reasons for exiting the unemployment benefitrecipient system and much more.The youngest data source is the basic income support system data, whichwas founded by the introduction of the Social Code 2 (SGB II) in 2005. Sincethen there is a second kind of benefit recipience information coming from theadministrative procedures of the basic income support system. The informationfound here is similar to the information in the unemployment benefit recipientdata, but does have another target population and a different benefit logic – thissystem is a means-tested benefit system and in most cases it is conjointly ad-ministered by the BA and the municipalities.Beside these data coming more or less from BA related processes, there isanother large data source stemming from a completely different institution. TheIAB hosts German employment data coming from the social insurance system.218So this data shows social insured employment in Germany, but no self-employment and no civil servants. It is important to notice that these data areproduced by completely different institutions, institutions that are completelyunrelated to the BA (see also Meyer, Mika and Thorvaldsen, in this SpecialIssue). The pension and health insurance institutions therefore use their ownperson identifier, the social security number. Analog to the unemploymentbenefit recipient data, the employment data start in 1975 and today end in2007. The data consist of spell data, providing daily, historical and individualinformation about employment. Available information are personal characteris-tics, employment times, remuneration, occupation, etc.3. Data Generation and Institutional BiasAfter the brief introduction of the most important parts of the IAB researchdata base, a closer look to the data generation process is necessary. This isessential, because these data, used for social research, are produced in a “for-eign” – non scientific – context. The research data in this understanding repre-sent a secondary usage of data that are collected for administrative purposes.Therefore administrative data being used as a research data source represent adata source of unobtrusive measures (cf. Best 2003: 112). To understand theresearch potentials and risks in the data background knowledge about the datageneration process, situation and setting is required. Also important is knowl-edge about the administrative processes in which the data are collected (cf.Bick, Müller 1984: 123; cf. Wallgren 2007: 180). In order to give here a shortimpression of such background knowledge the genesis of the research datafrom the operation registration to the finished research data set will be outlined.Figure 1 shows the way from operational level to the research data using job-seeking data as example.In the first step of the process the job-seeker communicates with the BA-agent in the placement service. The job-seeker is obliged to give information tothe agent and these are only information relevant for the administrative processof job-placement. Some information are registered in the face-to-face situationof agent and client, so that the agent simultaneously has to communicate withthe client and register data in the operational IT-system - and all that possiblyunder time pressure. This stressful situation has some implications on dataquality. There might be some errors in the registered information and informa-tion more important for the placement process (e.g. occupational information)will be registered and checked priorly.22 This is a general factor in administrative data. Process produced research data always aredetermined by the specific administrative system upon there are based (cf. Wallgren 2007:176).219Figure 1: Model of Data Flow3.1 Lack of Cross-ConsolidationAnother important point to notice is, that the IT-system is directly linked to theappropriate administrative process. So information concerning job-search isregistered in the job-search IT-system (called VerBIS), information for thebenefit recipience process in the benefit recipient IT-system. As mentionedabove, there is nearly no validation of information by cross-checks between thedifferent autonomous IT-systems.After the registration and storage in the operational IT-systems some infor-mation is transferred to the central pool of BA business data. The pool centrallystores important data from the operational IT-systems and therefore includesdata from all operational IT-systems of the BA plus some more selected datalike employment data. It is important to notice, that the data are stored cen-trally, but are not integrated.This data pool provides the base data used for creating the IAB data prod-ucts. The data integration and consolidation work in order to build up the re-search data base is done by the IAB itself. The following graphic shows thisexplicitly:220Figure 2: Model of Data SourcesIn this picture the pillar principle in the BA-data is made visible. The differ-ent administrative processes have appropriate operational IT-systems that workmore or less autonomous. In the database of the BA the data are centrallystored but not integrated. This step is done by the IAB when creating an inte-grated person centered database. Some more steps in the IAB data productionprocess are not illustrated above, but it should be clear that our methodologicalproblem of dealing with inconsistent information has be solved before an inte-grated research data base can be built up.In the next part three typical data problems will be presented and some ex-amples for solutions are given:1) The problem of the identification and integration of a person in the data willbe illustrated.2) Possibilities of consolidation of inconsistent information will be presented.3) Some remarks about the problems resulting from long time series data willbe made.4. Integration and Consolidation of Data on a Single PersonAs shown above the IAB integrates data from different sources. With thatintegration comes the need for consolidating manifold inconsistencies in thedata. For example a person might have different nationalities at the same pointof time in data source A and data source B.A precondition for the dealing with inconsistent information is the identifi-cation of a comprehensive person. Only if one knows that person A in datasource A is the same person as person B in data source B a consolidation ofinformation between both data sources can be done.221So the first thing to be done is that person identification. Now why shouldthat be a problem? As already mentioned different IT-systems use differentperson identifiers. We have at least two identifiers per person – the BA-clientnumber (KNR) and the social security number (VSNR). In both cases it ispossible that one person has more than one of those identifiers.1) BA-Client Number (Kundennummer, KNR): Until 2003 the BA-client num-ber was decentrally assigned by the different BA-agencies. Each agency ofthe BA (more than 270 in Germany) assigned its own number after a personentered the administrative process. That means that after changing the agen-cy because of moving to another city a new number was assigned. A newnumber also was assigned if a client after a longer period of absence couldnot remember his old number and told the agent that he didn't have a BA-client number. Another factor is the above mentioned stressfull registrationprocedure. In this situation an already assigned BA-client number might beregistered incorrect. All these factors lead to the fact that a person might ha-ve more than one BA-client number, either historically or even at the samepoint of time. Another identification problem can be found in the historicalBA-data. Before 2005 more identifiers existed along with the BA-clientnumber. An example later on used is the BA-registration number (EGNR).2) Social Security Number (Versicherungsnummer, VSNR): The second majorperson identifier comes with the employment data. The social security num-ber is assigned by the pension insurance. For each person that enters anemployment that is covered by the social insurance system the pension insu-rance assigns a stable identifier that should not change over the life course.But here it is possible too that a person has more than one number.All these problems result in the need for a stable, consistent and comprehen-sive person identifier in the integrated IAB data. There are two possible strate-gies to create that identifier:1) Known relations between the different identifiers in the BA data can beused. By combining the already known related identifiers one person can beidentified as being one person in the different data sources.2) Known personal attributes like name, first name, date of birth and sex arematched. If that matching brings a good degree of accordance it is plausiblethat a person in two data sources actually is the same person.In the case of the IAB data both possibilities are used and will be brieflyoutlined here.4.1 Identifying and Checking ConnectionsIn a first step all the given identifiers in the data are systematically checked forconnections. This is possible because in the different IT-systems along with theprimary ID of that operational IT-system other IDs are registered as secondaryinformation. An example for this are the job-seeking data. Here the primary222identifier is the BA-client number (KNR), but during the administrative processthe social security number (VSNR) is registered as well as a secondary attrib-ute. This results in relations between the different identifiers in different datasources. By systematically checking these connected information a person andits different IDs can be identified.The second step for identifying a comprehensive person is matching fourpersonal attributes and look for the accordance in that match. The second stepis possible because of a (redundant) storage of this information in different IT-systems. The four already described personal attributes can be found in thedifferent data sources. And this step is necessary for avoiding wrong mergersof persons.The following example with fictive data in two tables makes this identifica-tion process transparent. The fictive example consists of data of two personswho are married. The data used are stored in two central table, the BA-Client-History-Table and the BA-Client-Table. The identification process uses com-bined information from both table. The example consists of three steps: Firstrelated identifiers in table 1 are combined, second the related identifiers in table1 are combined with identifiers in table 2 and third the proposed combinationof identifiers are validated by matching personal attributes. In the end the twopersons are comprehensively identified.The first table used in this example is the BA-Client-History:Table 1: Fictive BA-Client-HistoryKNR1214141517BA-Client-HistoryVSNR13111080S61113111080S61152111080S61313111080S61113111080S611SEXMMMWMDate of Birth11.10.8011.10.8011.10.8001.12.8211.10.80NameMaierMaierMaierMaierMaierFirst nameHansHansHansIngridHansThe second table to be considered is the BA-Client-Table:Table 2: Fictive BA-ClientThe identification process goes as follows:KNR12121315BA-ClientEGNR1231241241252231) In the first step the given relations between the IDs are used. Using the BA-Client-History, VSNRs 13111080S611 and 52111080S613 are allocated tothe same person via KNR 14 in BA-Client-History. KNR 12, 14 and 17 arealso assigned to that person because of having the same VSNR.2) Taking into consideration the EGNR in the BA-Client-Table KNR 13 can berelated to KNR 12 via the identical EGNR 124. Therefore KNR 13 refers tothis person too.3) Going one step further KNR 15 could also be related to this person becauseof the identical VSNR (see BA-Client-History). At this point the second i-dentification step gets important. KNR 15 has a different sex, date of birthand first name. When matching these four attributes no accordance can befound. Therefore KNR 15 is identified as being a second person. Conside-ring the BA-Client-Table EGNR 125 is allocated to that second person.So in the end, linking the different related IDs would indicate one identicalperson in all the given data, but matching the already mentioned four centralpersonal attributes result in an inconclusive match. Therefore we assume in thiscase the related IDs would wrongly be linked. This results in the identificationof two separate persons. Person 1 has four different KNRs, two differentVSNRs and two EGNRs. Person 2 has one KNR, one VSNR and one EGNR.This reduces the given five KNRs, two VSNRs and three EGNRs to two com-prehensively identified and checked person-IDs.4.2 Identifying and Handling Data Integration InconsistenciesNow that we have an integrated and comprehensive person, the integration ofthe data can begin. In this step of the data production process inconsistencies inthe data become visible. As mentioned above, there is nearly no cross-checkingof the data during the data registration process. So in the administrative processonly few of the registered information in the different IT-systems are validatedby comparing information between the different operational IT-systems. Thiscan lead to inconsistencies. For example one person can be registered as beingemployed and unemployed at the same point of time, because these two statusinformation are raised by two different administrative institutions (pensioninsurance and BA). But this also can happen in the BA data, when differentadministrative processes and IT-systems are used. The following figure, show-ing visualized spell data along the time axis from left to right, illustrates thisfact:224Figure 3: Spell dataBeH: Time of employment | ASU: Time of job-search | LeH: Time of unemploymentbenefit recipience | MTG: Time of participation in active labor market policy programsIt can be seen that different data sources and states do have overlapping timeperiods. On a first glance it is not clear which overlaps are plausible and whichare implausible. Under some premises overlapping times of employment andjob-search are allowed, but under other circumstances they are not. So legalbackground knowledge is required to decide which overlapping spells shouldbe consolidated and which have to remain overlapping. A consolidation rulewould have to account for all possible (and impossible) overlapping times andinconsistent states and information. A good example for those rules would bethe consolidation of employment times and times of unemployment benefitrecipience (SGB III). In general parallel times in this case are forbidden. But ifthe employment does not exceed a certain amount of working hours per week,parallel times of (small part time) employment and benefit recipience is al-lowed. On the other hand full time employment parallel to benefit recipience isnot allowed under any circumstances. Here the exact knowledge of the legalbackground is required to decide about the correct consolidation.33 It has to be noticed that such a combination of forbidden states might also be an indicationof benefit abuse. In any case, if data error or benefit abuse, only an exact knowledge of thebackground information together with a sound analysis of the data itself allow an adequateinterpretation and consolidation of the data.225All these sketched problems illustrate that a consolidation of data from twodifferent data sources perhaps might be possible, but developing consolidationrules for more than two or three different data sources is very fast getting toocomplex to do.4.3 Degree of ConsolidationBeside the complexity of the necessary consolidation rules a second fact has tobe taken into account. Consolidating data always means overwriting and there-fore destruction of information. This means that there are two diverging strate-gies concerning the consolidation of inconsistent data: Little consolidationversus much consolidation. The strategies have direct implications for theresearch that can be conducted with generated data base:1) Little consolidation, coming with a smaller loss of information but manyinconsistencies, generates more individual research options and more ex-penses for data preparation for the researcher. Following from this is in abroader variety of research results, but also perhaps disparate and incompa-rable findings.2) Much consolidation overwrites information and this information is lost forthe researcher. A stronger consolidation results in structured data, therebyalso structuring the research options and minimizing the expenses for the re-searcher. An error in the consolidation rules inevitably leads to misinterpre-tations of the data, therefore possibly producing false research results.One more problem in integrated administrative data will be presented here.This problem is directly related to the result of a strong consolidation strategy.Much consolidation leads to overwritten information. But in administrativedata a seemingly similar attribute can have more than one process dependentmeaning resulting in different ranges of values. Training is good example forthis problem. Information about the level of training can be found in diversedata sources. But the exact meaning of the attribute “training” changes for eachdata source because it is directly related to the appropriate administrative proc-ess. In case of employment data the information in that attribute are related toemployment, therefore more oriented on the level of education of the person. Inthe case of job-seeking data the seemingly same attribute has a different rangeof values and these values are skill-level oriented. That is the case because theadministrative purpose is job-search where the skill-level is the important in-formation. In such cases often it is impossible to correctly transcode the differ-ent information, so the process related information has to be kept in the data.4.4 Handling Long Time-SeriesThe fourth subject to be discussed here is the time dimension of the data. Asmentioned in chapter 2 the available time series of employment and benefitrecipient data starts in 1975. This means legal configurations could have226changed and in fact did change over the last 30 years, as well as the administra-tive practices, the IT-systems, etc. Even formerly forbidden states in the datatoday could be allowed or vice versa.Such long time series in process generated data provide special challenges.The mentioned changes in the legislation, changes in the administrative proc-esses and practices and changes in the operational IT-systems all result inbreaches in the time series of the historical data. Moreover the classification ofoccupation and economic sector, the range of values in attributes and the re-gional information can and will change over time. Another big challenge posesthe old documentation, that is rudimental at best. Getting background informa-tion regarding IT-systems or administrative practices from documentation fromthe 1970s or the 1980s is nearly impossible. The experts from that times areretired and therefore the knowledge is inaccessible.So, concerning historical data, there is no golden or general rule for han-dling the data.In the case of changes in legislation or changes in the IT-systems thesmoothing of the breaches depends on the dimension of the change. A breachin the time series is inevitable if an exact mapping of information from theolder data structure to the newer one is impossible. This is due to the fact thatwithout an exact mapping the transformation of older information into thenewer data structure would mean a massive and back dated overwriting ofinformation. It also would mean to inscribe data from the newer situation into adifferent historical situation. Therefore the changes in the data only can bedocumented if an exact mapping is not possible. This leaves the researcher freeto decide how he interprets and deals with the breaches.The same fact holds true for changing ranges of values in attributes. A goodexample for that is the classification of economic sectors. This classificationchanged three times in the last fifteen years. In two cases an exact one to onemapping of old classification to new classification was not possible. In the lastchange in about 30% of the old classifications the mapping to the new classifi-cations is inconclusive. This implies that there is no possibility to consolidatethe data. The solution here can only be describing and documenting thechanges. A researcher using the data can choose himself how to deal with thisbreach in the time series of the data.Another strategy is used when regional information have to be integrated,consolidated and updated. Regional information in many cases can be mappedto the newest status. This is possible because for any case of change in thedimension of the municipalities, there exists an exact mapping of old regionalinformation to new regional information. An example for this would be thereformation of the size of districts in eastern Germany in the mid-1990s or inSaxony in 2008. In each case it is clear which part of district went to whichnew district or which districts were merged. This administrative information is227available and hence can be used to consolidate the regional information whenproducing the integrated IAB data base.Summing up the remarks concerning historical data, it can be said that ingeneral a smoothing of the breaches in the long time series in the data is notpossible. Therefore the main focus lies on the exact documentation of knownfacts and eventually of background knowledge.5. ConclusionTo sum up the general guidelines, applicable for data errors stemming fromthe data registration process as well as problems in time-series, the followingfacts are consolidated:- only valid values of an attribute are used- only valid dates are used (e.g. start date < end date)- filters and default values in the operational IT-systems are documented asfar as they are known- some central personal attributes like sex and date of birth are consolidatedon the basis of the identification of a comprehensive person- background knowledge and important legal or procedural knowledge isdocumentedThis brings us to the answer of the general methodological questions askedin the introduction. There is no golden rule how to deal with inconsistencies inthe data, because each problem solving strategy has specific implications andconsequences. And these are general ones. An adequate answer to the questionof data integration und consolidation can only be an individual one and de-pends on the specific project. But the consequences of each strategy alwayshave to be kept in mind.Our philosophy emphasizes weaker consolidation rules favoring documenta-tion instead of hard data consolidation. This leaves more degrees of freedom tothe researcher, enabling him to make the necessary decisions in data cleansingby himself and fitting to his priorities. The IAB research data base therefore isbacked up by detailed and extensive documentation – a documentation that isessential to know when working with this research data base. And this strategyis applicable for other research data too.The IAB data integration and consolidation processes result in standardizedresearch data products, covering the complete targeted group with nearly noitem- or unit-nonresponse, gaps in retrospection, selective retention or recallerrors. On the other hand the data quality especially of data from the 1970s or1980s is hard to grasp and, being administrative data, the data lack informationon household, attitudes, preferences, etc.The philosophy of data preparation in this data implies that only in clearlydefined cases consolidation is done. The emphasis lies on documentation of thefacts and background information. Therefore a good knowledge of the data228generation process, its problems and framework is required and essential forusing the full potential of the data.References<ref>Bick, Wolfgang/Mann, Reinhard/Müller, Paul J.
