A survey of works councillors in over fifty mostly privatised textilefirms provided some initial indication that they have a cautious, co-operative attitudetowards management and are surely not „extended arms of management“ as hasbeen often declared in the literature. Moreover, a survey of the unionised workers inthese firms revealed an overwhelming acceptance of their works councils and aconviction that the limited effectiveness of these institutions is mainly caused by thecurrent economic constraints rather than by internal deficiencies of the newinstitutions.Dieser Artikel verfolgt zwei Zielsetzungen: Es werden die Einstellungen vonBetriebsräten zur Betriebsleitung und die Wirksamkeit ihrer Interessenvertretung inüber 50 ostdeutschen Textilunternehmen untersucht. Die Fragebogenuntersuchungder Betriebsräte zeigt eine vorsichtige, grundsätzlich kooperative Einstellung zurBetriebsleitung und widerspricht dem in der Literatur häufig dargestellten Bild desostdeutschen Betriebsrat als „wehrloses Anhängsel“ der Betriebsleitung. DieBefragung der gewerkschaftlich organisierten ArbeiterInnen in diesen Unternehmenunterstützt dieses Ergebnis und zeigt, daß der Betriebsrat mehrheitlich begrüßt undals neue institutionalisierte Interessenvertretung akzeptiert und auch aktiv unterstütztwird. Die eingeschränkten Erfolge der Betriebsräte in den letzten Jahren werden inerster Linie der schwierigen wirtschaftlichen Lage der Textilindustrie und nicht, wievielfach vermutet, Unzulänglichkeiten der Institutionen selber zugeschrieben.Introduction***1.____________________________________________________________________Carola Frege, Ph.D., 1965, Lecturer in Industrial Relations, London School of Economics andPolitical Science, Industrial Relations Department, Houghton Street, London WC2A 2AE.Research interests: industrial relations in transforming economies, comparative industrialrelations, works councils.I wish to thank Ray Richardson, John Kelly and David Marsden for their helpful commentson earlier drafts of this paper.Artikel eingegangen: 7.10.96, revidierte Fassung akzeptiert: 15.1.1997.Industrielle Beziehungen, 4. Jg., Heft 3, 1997197Works councils were forbidden during the socialist regime but have been widelyestablished following the transfer of the (West) German industrial relations system intothe East in 1990 (see Jander and Lutz 1991; Kirschner 1991).1 The development ofworks councils in East Germany after Unification has been a popular topic of industrialrelations research in the last five years (e.g. Dathe and Schreiber 1993; David 1992;Mickler and Walker 1992; Röske and Wassermann 1991; SOFI Göttingen [e.g. Bluhm,Kern and Land, Kirschner, Voßkamp and Wittke]; Berlin/Göttingen group [Kädtler,Kottwitz, Jander, Lutz, Rosenbaum, Weinert]; WISOC Chemnitz [e.g. Ermischer,Kreißig, Lungwitz, Preusche]). Although much interesting work has been done, thereare perhaps two deficiencies. The first is at the methodological level. The publishedresearch is almost entirely based on expert interviews and/or case studies of specificcompanies. More representative, quantitative studies have yet to be undertaken. Thesecond deficiency is on a contextual level. Although it has been frequently argued thatemployees are crucial actors at workplace level, there are still no broadly-based,quantitative studies of their attitudes, opinions or behaviour at this level.This paper addresses these deficiencies in a study of workplace relations in theEast German textile industry. Two main issues are discussed. Firstly, it examines thepattern of works councillor attitudes towards management through a questionnaire.Secondly and perhaps more importantly, it investigates the extent to which workscouncils are effective in representing workers interests. This will be discussed byanalysing the perceptions of unionized workers towards their own works councils.The paper starts by reviewing the relevant literature on workplace relations in EastGermany.2.Co-operative Workplace Relations or Works Councils as „Extended Armsof Management“?Research on East German workplace relations commonly distinguishes betweenthe period before and the period after privatisation of the East German enterprises,2since privatisation is seen as having a radical impact on workplace relations (e.g.Dathe and Schreiber 1993: 6; Ermischer and Preusche 1992; Hürtgen 1992). Withregard to the first period, one may distinguish two views. The first argues that therelationship between management and works council was typically essentially co-operative, whilst the second argues that it was one in which the works council wastypically subservient.12The West German Works Constitution Act (BetrVG 1972), the legal foundation of workscouncils, was introduced on June 1st 1990 before the political Unification (October 1990).The East German (state) industry was privatised through the Treuhandanstalt Berlin, the stateprivatisation agency, which started its work in 1991. The Treuhand took over the assets andliabilities (over 100 Mrd Deutsche Mark) of the East German industry (combines). In 1992the Treuhand had responsibility for over 5.100 companies (Treuhand prospectus„Entschlossen Sanieren“ 1992: 17). In the end of 1994/beginning of 1995 the Treuhand hadcompleted its work of privatising most of the firms and was dissolved.198Frege: Co-operative Workplace Relations in East Germany?Analysts in the first tradition see the enterprise as being characterized by a co-operative relationship, i.e. „co-management“ (Ermischer and Preusche 1993) or„partnership for progress/construction“ („Aufbaupartnerschaft“) (Röske and Wasser-mann 1991), and they offer three main reasons.Firstly, the legacy of former socialisation and „collective“ experiences insocialist workplaces (e.g. life-long employment in the same firm, everyone knowingeach other, and with no extreme social status differences between management andworkers) is said to enhance co-operation.Secondly, there is said to have been a particular inter-dependence betweenmanagement and works councils: both parties had an equal status in the beginning,even that management was sometimes in a weaker situation since it had to earn/regain legitimacy from the workforce (i.e. unclarified power relations, i.e. „powervacuum“ [Machtvakuum]) (e.g. Kirschner 1992: 85). Consequently, it is claimed thatmanagement was dependent on the works council to get the support of the workforcefor any restructuring. Moreover, both parties faced radical challenges from theinternal and external environments. It is argued that this worked as a force for co-operative relations in order to have at least one stabilizing factor during the difficultsurvival process. According to Ermischer and Preusche (1995: 55) „the co-operationenhanced the plant level process of transformation and helped to compensate for thelack of experience of both management and the works council with the strangeeconomic and legal system“. One should also note that the common „enemy“, theTreuhand (the state privatisation agency) arguably induced „emergency associations“(Notgemeinschaften).Thirdly, there was the particularly unifying aim of (a) preparing the enterprise forthe market economy (e.g. Dathe and Schreiber 1993: 9), and (b) of dismantling thepolitical structures, i.e. „de-ideologisation“ of the work structure and organisation (e.g.getting rid of the „red socks“). Some even argue that there has been a third unifyingaim, the development of more employee involvement (Ermischer and Preusche 1992: 2).In sum, these authors conclude that co-management generally emerged in theircase study companies because of the specific internal situations after the „Wende“(turnaround). Ermischer and Preusche's empirical investigation (interviews in 34companies of mostly the metal industry in Saxony from 1991 onwards) bases itsconclusion on the finding that in the majority of cases the management and workscouncil saw their relationship as a positive, co-operative relationship with the aim ofachieving consensus (1993: 185).It is a weakness of these studies that we are not told which interview questionswere asked, nor are important terms like „co-operation“ clearly defined. For example,the perception of „shared goals“ does not necessarily lead to an effectivecodetermination, i.e. co-operation. It is also possible that if a works council shares thesame goals as management, it does not see the need to become pro-active.This view is supported by the other school of thought on these issues who proposethat co-operative works councils in East Germany are „extended arms of management“Industrielle Beziehungen, 4. Jg., Heft 3, 1997199rather than „independent“ and effective worker institutions. Some of their argumentswill be reviewed: Jander and Lutz (1991: 411) of the Berlin/Göttingen group found intheir surveys3 that cases of pro-active works councils were the exception rather than therule, and they speculate that these were likely to have been concentrated around Leipzigand Dresden (the home of the civil movement). They also found that even in thebeginning, when works councils formally attended management meetings, they did notparticipate greatly in the decision making, but basically agreed to decisions whichsounded economically rational. For example, there was no works council in their samplewhich had developed alternatives to management's reconstruction concept. In general,works councillors were found to be very open to economic arguments because of theirbelief that economic irrationality led the former system into ruin. Economic rationalityand especially technological progress were often seen as panaceas (also Dathe andSchreiber 1993: 42; David 1992: 132-134). Mickler et al.'s case study of VW gives animpressive account of the works council's agreement to the introduction of leanproduction without any restrictions (1992: 16). Moreover, according to Jander and Lutz(ibid.) East German works councils generally did not (and still do not) mobilize againststaff reductions, because they are accepted as unavoidable, and avoid any politicisationof labour relations, since this is seen as a core reason for the old mis-management.Consequently, as Kädtler and Kottwitz (1994: 27) argue, the „works council as apartner/arm of management“ is often believed by works councillors themselves to be theideal type (see Kotthoff's typology below). Accordingly, as the authors conclude, therelationship between management and works council is not seen by the councillors asthe expression of any fundamental conflict of interest but as a „functionalcomplementary relationship“. Similarly, their study found that works councils, havingrealized that their scope for action is very limited, were persuaded that co-operation isthe best posture. The authors mention that „it is not the announcement of a third orfourth redundancy round which causes a 'hardening of the fronts' but instead the timeswhen management violates the rights of the works council or is guilty of negligence“(p.28). Thus, only when informal norms were violated, did the works council become„aggressive“.4Jander and Lutz also remark that the early attendance of the works council atboard meetings in some firms could easily be seen more as a management strategy toget the workers to accept organisational changes than as an indicator of co-management. In addition, Kädtler (1992: 8-10) cannot find any evidence to suggest that34Expert interviews and documentary work in 40 companies in Saxony and Thüringen during theunification period (1989/90) and six intensive longitudinal case studies (mainly from interviewswith works councils) in these regions, plus equivalent investigations around Berlin (22companies) till 1992/3 (see Jander and Lutz 1991; Kädtler and Kottwitz 1994) make up theirempirical underpinning. Most companies were of the metal, chemical or electronics industry.The author of the present article observed the same in a chemical company which she visitedin Bitterfeld in 1993. It experienced mass redundancies without any interference from theworks council or workforce, but when management once violated a specific legal(information) right of the works council, the works council organized an immediate walkout.200Frege: Co-operative Workplace Relations in East Germany?there were conflicts in the early period (Winter 1989) in those enterprises, which hadquite extensive rights for their works councils, over the introduction of the morerestrictive German works councils law. He goes so far as to argue that even if thebroader participation rights had been kept, the outcome of „co-management“ wouldhave been the same, largely due to the particular economic and political context.There is more agreement among analysts as the quality of workplace relationsafter privatisation. The workforce, works council and management no longer jointlyface the Treuhand in safeguarding the interests of the enterprise. It is argued that theclassic division of interests between capital and labour therefore becomes moreexplicit (Ermischer and Preusche 1995: 59; Lungwitz and Preusche 1994). Workplacerelations become characterized on the one side by management strengthening itsposition (e.g. legitimized by new owners or by a management buy-out), andfrequently reinforcing „taylorist“ control and disciplinary methods (e.g. Bluhm 1992;Lippold et al. 1992; Voskamp and Wittke 1991). On the other side the deterioratingeconomic situation is regarded as to reduce the task of works councils to that ofadministrating redundancies instead of „co-managing“ the on-going reorganisation.For example, Mickler et al.'s case study (e.g. 1992) of the new Volkswagen carfactory in Saxony showed that the informal „survival pacts“ which existed in 1990were starting to fall apart by 1992: management wanted more productivity and theworkforce wanted to keep their traditional piece rates and customs. Thus, Mickler etal. write that it is „not the democratisation of workplace relations, but company’ssurvival, massive redundancies and the securing of a minimum social standard[which] determines the daily work of the councils“ (1993: 21). Finally, it is arguedthat privatisation often leads to the employment of West German or foreign managerswho are likely to challenge the established East German community (see Aderhold etal. 1994).In sum, the literature on workplace relations in East German enterprises beforeprivatisation can be categorized into two broad camps, a positive/optimistic one (e.g.WISOC) who propose co-operative (and effective) works councils, and a negative/pessimistic one (e.g. Berlin/Göttingen). Obviously, these two groups are „idealtypes“. Both sides however agree that there has been a shift and deterioration inworks council-management relations over the years.The characterisation by some researchers of early workplace relations as co-operative would be enhanced by a precise definition of concepts such as „co-operation“ or „co-management“. Was it „real“ co-operation, say between two equallystrong partners,5 or a more one-sided acquiescence on the part of the works council?Furthermore, the argument that „co-operation“ has declined since privatisation doesnot say what it has been substituted by. Does „non-co-operation“ mean a conflictualrelationship or does it mean that the works council becomes (or continues to be) anextended arm of management, thus administering management functions, as5Co-operation is often defined differently, e.g. that people willingly co-operate because ofmutual gains (see Axelrod 1990).Industrielle Beziehungen, 4. Jg., Heft 3, 1997201Mahnkopf (1991: 280) or Jander and Lutz (1991) argue? Obviously, it is difficult atthis stage to make clear judgements about this development, so that statementsinevitably remain vague, e.g. Ermischer and Preusche's (1995: 60) conclusion thattheir case studies in 1994 show „more conflictual relations without the loss of co-operation“. In addition, the discussion on „co-management or conflict“ seems to beburdened with the problem that the authors seem to have different understandings ofwhat they mean by these terms, and that the concepts themselves are difficult tooperationalize.3.Effective Works Councils?Related to the question of co-operation is whether works councils manage torepresent workers' interests effectively or not. However, there is little West Germanresearch evaluating the quality of workplace relations and, in particular, examiningthe interrelation between the two actors in terms of effective interest representation.The only major study which focuses on the quality of interest representation isKotthoff's longitudinal case study analysis of 64 companies (1981; 1994),6 whichcreated a useful typology of works councils and distinguished between: (i) deficientforms of interest representation: „the ignored works council“; „the isolated workscouncil“; „the works council as an extended arm of management“; and (ii) effectiveforms of (autonomous) interest representation: „the respected, co-operative workscouncil“; „the respected, steadfast works council“; and „the works council as a co-operative hostile power“. There is no corresponding East German research on thisissue, which is partly explained by the fact that it is especially hard to measure theeffectiveness of interest representation during times of transformation. The mostcommon approach in the current East German literature is to outline some problemswhich works councils are currently facing and to assert (rather than to analyse) thatthese problems hinder the proper functioning of works councils. There are at leastfive problems mentioned in the literature (more by the Berlin/Göttingen group, e.g.Kädtler and Kottwitz (1993; 1994), than by WISOC) and it is difficult to disentanglethem: (i) the intensified classical dilemma facing works councils of balancing theinterests of the company and the workforce in the devastating economic situation ofEast Germany (e.g. Kottwitz 1991: 417); (ii) the unsuitability of the West Germanindustrial relations system in the East German context (one frequently given reason forwhich is the absence of prosperous companies which are said to be a precondition forthe successful functioning of the German industrial relations system) (e.g. Gut et al.1993; Kädtler and Kottwitz 1994: 19, 1992: 3; Mahnkopf 1992); (iii) problems due tothe newness of the institution, for example the fact that works councils lack tacit skillswhich are seen as necessary for the effective articulation and representation of interests(e.g. Jander and Lutz 1993; Mahnkopf 1991: 275); (iv) the problematic union-workscouncil relationship (rising „plant-egoism“ of works councils vs. collective interests of6In various industries in Baden-Würtemberg in 1974/5, and 15 years later he looked at thesame case studies again to measure possible changes in workplace relations.202Frege: Co-operative Workplace Relations in East Germany?the unions) (e.g. Lippold et al. 1992; Mahnkopf 1991: 282, 1993: 17); and (v) thesupposedly low image of the works council among the workforce, i.e. workers perceiveworks councils as ineffective (e.g. Jander et al. 1992).Kädtler and Kottwitz (1993: 4) go so far as to suggest that these deficiencies inworkplace relations have implications for the functioning of the whole industrialrelations system. According to Jander and Lutz (1993) there is the paradox thatalthough the West German industrial relations system was transferred without anyadjustments to the particular East German situation, East Germany could very wellend up not practising the same industrial relations as the West, especially because ofthe ineffective works councils (see also Jacoby 1994). For these researchers thereforethe likely scenario is of a few companies with „good“ workplace relations surroundedby a majority of companies with poor co-determination practices (see also Mahnkopf1991).However, listing possible reasons why works councils might not be effective isnot an entirely satisfactory exercise. The authors do not provide persuasive evidence asto why these problems render works councils ineffective, nor do they analyse whetherthese supposed problems are short-term (due to the novelty of the institutions) or long-term (due to the structural unsuitability of western regulations in the East).Furthermore, it has also not been tested how far these problems, rather than, forexample, unco-operative management, account for any works council ineffectiveness.There are also problems with the arguments as such. To give just one example: arguingthat the West German system is not suitable for the specific East German situation doesnot provide a convincing explanation why this should evoke a dysfunctioning of theworks council. Without wanting to go into the debate as to how far the situation in theEast today is comparable with that of West Germany after 1945 (see Jacoby 1994), itseems a dubious assertion that the West German industrial relations system only„works“ in prosperous economic situations. The system seems to have managedvarious recessions during the last few decades in West Germany.As said before most of the studies are based solely on interviews withcouncillors (and sometimes with management). Very few came from morecomprehensive case studies and none includes workers' attitudes and behaviourtowards the new institutions. This study attempts to contribute to the analysis of thequality of workplace relations in East German firms in two ways. Co-operativeworkplace relations will be investigated by focusing on one side, works councillors'attitudes towards management, only. Moreover, the study examines the „customers“of works councils, the workforce, and analyse their perceptions of the works council'seffectiveness.4.MethodThe study comprised two surveys, one of works councillors and one ofunionized workers in selected textile companies in East Germany. The purpose was toapply a quantitative method to the investigation of the workplace relations from aIndustrielle Beziehungen, 4. Jg., Heft 3, 1997203works councillors' and workers' point of view in a larger sample of workplaces(compared to the research reviewed).7The textile industry was and still is (similar to other manufacturing industries)severely affected by Unification and the subsequent exposure to the world marketwhich led to a dramatic reduction in employment8 (e.g. Küchle and Volkmann 1993).It was mainly selected because the textile industry is a sector which has not beenlooked at in the research of transformation and is largely neglected in the generalindustrial relations studies in Germany.The two surveys9 were carried out in 1994 in textile firms across the bargainingregion of the South East branch of the German textile union, GTB (Gewerkschaft fürTextil und Bekleidung). The union branch covers the largest part of East Germanyand includes the traditional textile cities in Saxony. At the time of the study (Summer1994) this union area comprised 385 textile and clothing firms with 28,070employees, of which 14,425 were union members. This results in a union density of48.2% (GTB Information 1994).The works councillor questionnaire was distributed to works councils of thatdistrict and was returned by 53 works councils.10 The questionnaire consisted of twoparts, one dealing with background information of the extent of transformation whichoccurred in the firm, the other dealing with a set of Likert-scale attitudinal questionson the workplace climate. These were adopted from Dastmalchian et al. (1991),Angle and Perry (1986) and Allen and Stephenson (1983).The union membership questionnaire was conducted in the above surveyed 53textile firms in 1994 and comprised altogether 73 questions on various issues of thetransformation of the workplaces. The questionnaire was distributed through the unionmachinery and works councils to union members. 440 completed questionnaires werereturned, which gives a response rate of approximately 40%. All questions wereanswered on 5-point Likert scales. A selection of the items which deal with workers'perception of the works council and workers' willingness to actively support the workscouncil is presented in the table of the results section. Workers' willingness to becomeactive is used as an additional, more indirect measure of people's views of theinstrumentality of works councils. A certain amount of trust in the institutions'effectiveness is assumed to be necessary for people to engage in works councils'78910It would have been too difficult to approach management in these companies, as access wassecured through the union.Between 1990 and 1993 the textile industry experienced a fall in output of 72% (StatistischesBundesamt). Of the 320.000 textile employees in 1989 only 27.000 remained in 1994 (a fallof 90%) (GTB Information).Copies are available from the author.The return rate is not known, since it was beyond the author's control to monitor the numberof firms which received the questionnaire. In the most unlikely case that all unionized workscouncils in the district (148) had received a questionnaire, the rate would be 35,8%. Thequestionnaire was to be filled out by one full-time councillor, not necessarily the chiefcouncillor. The questionnaire consists of 29 questions altogether.204Frege: Co-operative Workplace Relations in East Germany?activities. The items were taken from Deshpande and Fiorito (1989), Fiorito (1988),and Hartley et al. (1991) and were adapted to the specific context of works councils.Virtually no respondent filled out the company's name, which prevented a correlationof workers' and works councillors' questionnaires of the same company.5.Results5.1 Background Company Information of the Works Councillor SurveyFour topics were discussed, organisational changes (ownership, management,staff reductions, technology), workforce characteristics (male/female ratio), unionmembership (density), and incidents of industrial conflict. Most firms had beenprivatised (only 7 were still owned by the Treuhand) and belonged to West Germanor foreign companies or via MBO to management. Changes in management hadoccurred in most sites, yet there was a mixed picture regarding old/new managers. 22(out of 53) firms had either kept all or most former managers and 30 firms kept no oronly very few former managers. At the supervisory level nothing really had changed,with 41 firms having kept the former supervisors. T-tests11 revealed no significantdifferences between private and state ownership with regard to changes atsupervisory level and changes in management. Thus, privately owned firms had notnecessarily more „new“ supervisors and managers than Treuhand firms.With regard to staff reductions, most firms had reduced their staff by at least50%,12 which was not uncommon in other industries (e.g. Nolte and Sitte 1995). Withregard to the medium-term prospects of their firms, the respondents were split: 22 weresceptical and 20 were more optimistic. Privately owned firms were more optimisticthan Treuhand firms, and firms with new management felt more secure than those withformer managers staying.13 A majority of firms had invested in new machinery andrestructured the production process. Most works councillors perceived the work paceon the shopfloor to have increased enormously from 1989. With regard to theworkforce, in only three firms was the female rate less than 50% of the total workforce,and in 16 it was higher than 90%. This confirms the female dominance in the textileworkforce. Union density was still high: in 11 firms it was over 80% and in 20 between30 and 79% (which is roughly in line with the union density of the district: 48,2%). T-tests revealed that the density was stronger in firms with former managers and in moreunsecure firms, but not necessarily stronger in Treuhand firms compared to privateones. There were only three incidences of industrial unrest so far, which supports theidea of the textile industry as a non-militant sector, and the larger the female share inthe workforce the lower was the likelihood of industrial unrest. Finally, with regard tothe responding works councillors, over half have had been in position since 1990/91.111213T-tests are available from the author.In 1989 half of the firms employed between 200 and 1000 employees, in 1994 most of thememployed less than 100 employees.This was confirmed by t-tests.Industrielle Beziehungen, 4. Jg., Heft 3, 199720516 had been active members of the former socialist union branch (BGL =„Betriebsgewerkschaftsleitung“), and 34 had not. Thus, Martens' (1992) suggestion thatold unionists are in a majority in East German works councils could not be supportedhere. Furthermore, although this was not explicitly controlled for, one can assume thatall respondents were union members (since the GTB only distributed questionnaires tounionised works councils14).5.2Workplace Climate from the Viewpoint of the Works CouncillorsThe idea was to apply a set of previously tested questions here in order toexamine the quality of workplace relations (i.e. workplace climate) from the workscouncillors' viewpoint. It is obvious that this cannot provide a complete picture of theworkplace situation. In addition, this small-scale survey is not able to establishvarious types of works councils such as Kotthoff's detailed categorisation. However,it might be a first approach to investigate the two opposite hypotheses of theliterature, works council as „co-manager“ or as a powerless „extended arm ofmanagement“ in a relatively large sample of one industrial sector. The first eightitems of table 1 define the quality of the management–works council relations,whereas the remaining questions explore broader related topics.Three quarters of the respondents agreed on most issues, and there were virtuallyno missing answers. The first eight items were put into factor analysis and revealedtwo factors. The first factor (items 1.-4.) is concerned with the practice ofmanagement–works council relations, whereas the second factor (items 6.-8.)describes councillors' more general views on management.15Table 1:Absolute level of items of works council-management relations (N= sample size)1415Which means that at least the chief councillor is a union member.Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure = 0,6685; cumulated pct of variance = 65,6; factor 1 (items1.,2.,3.,4.): eigenvalue = 1,36214 (pct of variance = 17,0); alpha = 0,677 (standardized alpha= 0,679); factor 2 (items 6.,7.,8.): eigenvalue = 2,70014 (pct of variance = 33,8); alpha =0,598 (standardized alpha = 0,598).206Frege: Co-operative Workplace Relations in East Germany?With regard to the first factor, the workplace relationship was typicallyperceived as harmonious, the councillors were willing to do their part, and problemswere often solved informally. On the other hand, councillors felt insufficientlyinvolved in strategic planning and insufficiently informed. These might be seen as„standard“ complaints of councillors and one might conclude that in overall thepositive perception of the general relationship succeeds.There were significant correlations16 between whether the general relationshipwas perceived as positive and the number of former directors employed in thiscompany (r= .29*) and whether the councillor was a former BGL official (r= .27*):Works councillors in a company with no former directors were more likely toperceive the relationship as „good“ as in companies with former directors, and workscouncillors who were not former BGL officials were more likely to perceive therelationship as good than works councillors who were former BGL officials. This wasalso confirmed by t-tests. Thus, contrary to some suggestions in the literature (e.g.Ermischer and Preusche 1992) it may be that the old networks between directors and16Significance level: * = p<= 0,05, ** = p<= 0,01Industrielle Beziehungen, 4. Jg., Heft 3, 1997207union officials are more obstructive than helpful in creating co-operative workplacerelations in the privatised firms.Furthermore, the general perception of the workplace relations is correlated withthe following questions: the more works councils were involved in strategic planning(r= .35*) or feel sufficiently informed (r= -.38**), the more they perceived a positiverelationship with management and the less likely they described management asstrengthening its power. Moreover, companies which had not experienced industrialconflicts were more likely to have this harmonious relationship (r= .35*).Furthermore, t-tests found that the more insecure the future of the firm, the more theworks council saw the need for harmonious relationships (in the best interest of theworkforce). This is a very interesting finding. At first sight one might interpret goodrelationships with management as coming out of a weak bargaining position of theworks council. However, it seems more likely that it means that difficult times bindthe two sides together.Finally, t-tests revealed that companies with former managers were more likelyto have informal negotiations. This might indicate a legacy of former socialistworkplace relations in firms with predominantly former managerial staff, as has beensuggested in previous studies (e.g. Ermischer and Preusche 1993). Obviously it isdifficult to evaluate at this stage whether this is a temporary or a permanentphenomenon.With regard to the second factor („general views of management“) the overallresult is less positive. Management was perceived untrustful and as trying tostrengthen its power (t-tests revealed that this is more perceived in financially„secure“ than in „insecure“ firms). In addition, the councillors acknowledged theconflicting interests of employers and unions. If management was perceived to beseeking to strengthen its power, works councils were also more likely to perceiveunion–employer relations as antagonistic (r= .31*). However, t-tests did not reveal asignificant difference between private and state ownership with regard to perceptionsof different interests.In sum, it seems that although the works councillors were convinced of thedesirability of harmonious relations, and were willing to do its part, they realised thatmanagement was sometimes less willing to co-operate, and they perceived adifference of interests of both sides.Regarding the second part of the questionnaire, works councils were describedprimarily as connecting links between management and workforce, thus not as a pureinterest representation, and consequently the well-being of the company was seen asof prime importance. This is also a typical phenomenon in West German studies (e.g.Kotthoff 1994) and in line with the legislative objectives (Betriebsverfassungsgesetz).The data also adds support to the argument in the literature that „plant-level208Frege: Co-operative Workplace Relations in East Germany?egoism“17 predominates East German works councils (e.g. Lippold et al. 1992;Mahnkopf 1991: 282; 1993: 17).Furthermore, management was seen as pursuing a trustworthy relationship withthe workforce, which correlated with the general perception of good workplacerelations (r= .68**) and with works councils being described as a connecting linkbetween management and workforce (r= .32*). Interestingly, the higher the share offemales in the workforce, the more management was perceived as fostering a trustfulrelation with the workforce (r= .50**), and the works councils as a connecting link(r= .31*). However there was no significant difference between private and stateowned firms with regard to management's relationship to the workforce.Finally, the workforce was perceived as supporting the works council, especiallyin firms employing few former directors. Thus, the councillors argued that workplacerelations are generally better in firms with new management than with the olddirectors. Yet, the workforce is said to support the works council more in firms withnew management. One could follow that the works council saw privatisation and newmanagement as favourable conditions, whereas the workforce might have more them-and-us feelings towards the new management (and therefore supports their interestrepresentation stronger).5.3Union Members' Perceptions of Works CouncilsThe sample of the unionised workforce18 contained 70% females, 25% presentor past works council members, 8% union officials, 17% who declared themselves asformerly active union members, and 75% blue collar workers. The sample slightlyunderrepresents women textile workers and overrepresents works council membersand union officials. The author has no information on the representativeness of theage distribution for textile companies in this area.19 Table 2 presents the items ofworkers' perceptions of the instrumentality (effectiveness) of works councils and ofworkers' willingness to actively support works councils.The overall importance of works councils was widely acknowledged. Thecomparison between the BGL (former socialist union branch at shopfloor level) andthe works council received more divided answers, but still more than a half preferredthe works council. With regard to members' perception of works council effectivenessin dealing with specific workplace issues, the results were nearly equally split inpositive and negative perceptions, but with slightly more emphasis on the negativeside. However, one should note that people were not being asked here their overallviews on being represented by their works council. There were no significant171819Priority are company concerns rather than industry-wide concerns which chraracterize unionpolicies.Since access was secured through the union and works councils the sample was restricted tounion members only.12% are under 30 years, 37% are between 30-40 years, 25% between 41-50 years and 20%are more than 50 years old.Industrielle Beziehungen, 4.

Blue collar workers were slightly more negativeabout works councils' effectiveness than white collars.20Table 2:Level of items of instrumentality of works council and level of items of willingness toparticipate in works council activities (N= sample size)Furthermore, union members blamed the economic situation rather thanmanagement's strategies for works council's limited effectiveness. There was also astrong agreement on the need for active support of the works council. Moreover, thedata revealed a strong declared willingness to participate in time-limited, „organised“activities (i.e. activities organised by the works council) such as attending the workscouncil assemblies, but less willingness to become active in more time consuming,„self-initiated“ activities (i.e. activities where people deliberately take the initiative tobecome active). T-tests revealed no significant demographic differences.20T-tests are available from the author.2106.DiscussionFrege: Co-operative Workplace Relations in East Germany?The findings of the works councillor questionnaire contribute to twopropositions of the literature reviewed. Firstly, they cannot support the widespreadclaim of researchers that workplace relations were more antagonistic or that theworks council was pushed to the sidelines after privatisation. Clearly, this data is a„snap shot“, not longitudinal and thus does not provide information on possiblechanges before and after privatisation. Furthermore, the small sample and the limitednumber of questions do not allow a final judgement on the quality of works council-management relations. However, the data gives a first indication that the currentrelationship in these firms, which are mostly privatised, was generally harmonious.Thus, the data adds support to the argument of „co-management“ by the WISOCgroup (e.g. Ermischer and Preusche 1992). Moreover, it challenges the argument thatco-management is at risk in firms after privatisation (e.g. Ermischer and Preusche1995: 59), and that privatisation is likely to cause a polarisation between the twosides (e.g. Kern and Land 1991). In contrast, the data revealed that co-operation wasmore likely where there were „new“ managers and „new“ works councillors. A ratherstraightforward interpretation for this perhaps surprising finding is that the oldrelations between directors and worker representatives were highly distrustful andconflictual and privatisation enabled „fresh blood“ to make a new start. This assumesthat both sides perceive co-operative relations as worthwhile (the councillorsacknowledged this).Secondly, the findings oppose the fears of some researchers (especially theBerlin/Göttingen group) that works councils are powerless „extended arms ofmanagement“. Although the councillors in this sample are obviously not „conflictual,class conscious works councils“ and strongly antagonistic (see Kotthoff's typologyabove), they are very aware of the different interests of capital and labour and also ofthe power balance within the firm and do not necessarily trust management. Thus,they surely do not represent Kotthoff's „deficient“ types of works councils (isolated,ignored, extended arm of management), but more his „effective“ types, in particularthe „respected, co- operative“ works council. In other words, the data supports morethe hypothesis of co-operative relationships than that of a one-sided acquiescence onthe part of the works councils. However, the survey certainly does not allow any finalconclusion regarding the practical effectiveness of the works councils' interestrepresentation, and therefore the categorisation can be only speculative. The realeffectiveness of these councils is better to be explored by methods such as non-participative observation or interviews with the workforce or by the workforcequestionnaires. However, the finding that the works councils felt strongly supportedby the workforce might be a first indicator of the works councils' functioning andindeed its effectiveness.With regard to the membership questionnaire the three major findings are firstlythe overall acceptance of the works council as a necessary institution, and a clearpreference for the new interest institution. This also confirms the preliminaryIndustrielle Beziehungen, 4. Jg., Heft 3, 1997211suggestion in the works council questionnaire, that works councils saw themselvesbeing accepted by their workforce.The second major result refers to the divided views on the works council's actualwork. One needs to address how this finding relates to the hypothesis in the literaturethat workers are highly disillusioned over the effectiveness of works councils (withrespect to the redundancies, co-management etc.). Workers were realistic about thelimited resources of works councils in these economic circumstances. This might bedisappointing, yet it did not lead people to reject the institution as such. In short,although the findings do not suggest highly effective and powerful institutions,workers conclude that this is related more to the external conditions than to the designof the institution as such. One should add that this result might be biased by the factthat only union members were asked. However, this survey was also distributed tonon-union members in the largest firm of our sample and the results for this firm didnot reveal any significant differences between non-union members and members inthis respect (see Frege 1996a, chp. 9). In sum, the data adds support to the morepositive studies about workers' attitudes towards the works council, such as Heeringand Schroeder (1992) who found that 76% of their sample had a positive attitudetowards their works council (the precise question is however not published); andchallenges pessimistic studies such as Jander et al. (1992). Moreover, the large-scalesurvey, DGB Trendbarometer (IFEP 1994) which surveys a representative sample ofthe German working population (employed and unemployed) every other year (since1992 in the East and West), on their attitudes towards interest institutions, shows thata majority of East German employees value the works councils' work in 1994 slightlymore than in 1992, although they were still more critical than in the West: in 199432% of East Germans valued the work (46% West Germans), 30% marked itnegatively (25%). In particular, our data is more positive than the DGB results for theGTB (West and East): These were in 1992 considerably below the DGB Germanaverage with only 6% approving the works council's work (no separate data for1994). However 59% did not answer and the sample consisted of only 83 persons,which questions the data's reliability.21Finally, the third result refers to members' strong willingness to participate incertain works council activities and their conviction that workers' support is anecessary condition for works councils' effectiveness. This underlines workers'acceptance of the new institution and a conviction of its basic instrumentality.Besides, the data supports an established western theory that members are far easierto mobilize for selective collective actions than for continuous voluntarycommitments. A similar distinction has also been found in the questions on unionparticipation (see Frege 1996b) and also in West German studies. For example,Wiedenhofer (1979: 44) found 20% willing members to stand for works councilelection, the Sozialreport (1993: 30) found 23% willing to become active for „worker21Separate data of the West and East German members of the GTB is not available.212Frege: Co-operative Workplace Relations in East Germany?interests“, and Krieger et al. (1989: 165) found 36%(representative for West Germany).of their union sample7.ConclusionNeither survey can provide the in-depth analysis of workplace relations thatintensive case studies can provide. On the other hand it is rare to see relatively largesamples of works councils and unionized workers being examined together, and thisin an industrial sector which is normally neglected in such an area of research.In a nutshell the works councillor data presented co-operative attitudes towardsmanagement, in particular in firms with „new“ managers and „new“ councillors.However, the councillors were cautious in trusting management and critical aboutmanagement's willingness to co-operate. They also did not perceive themselves asextended arms of management. Overall, it seems safe to say that co-operation mightwell be founded on the new transferred industrial relations institutions rather thanbeing a legacy of the socialist times.Moreover, works councillors did not seem to neglect their representative tasks,as has been proposed in various studies (e.g. Jander and Lutz 1991; Kädtler andKottwitz 1994). This is supported by the worker survey. The data reveals that,although successes were critically evaluated, workers were aware of the desperateeconomic situation limiting works council's possibilities. Thus the limitedeffectiveness of works councils did not prejudice people's acceptance, legitimisationand support of the new institutions (contrary to Jander et al. 1992). The workscouncils were widely accepted as a necessary and important interest institution atworkplace level.In sum, both data sets support Kotthoff's category of an effective, respected andco-operative works council (which was also the major category in his West Germanstudy). This finding might stir up first doubts about the conclusion of some literature(e.g. Mense-Petermann 1996) that qualitatively different workplace relationsbecoming established in the East Germany (compared to the West). In addition, thedata also indicates a successful „institutionalisation“ of the works council. Thus, notonly were the works councils formally installed but also the „substantive“ or„normative“ establishment was successful in terms of the acceptance, legitimisationand support of the actors, i.e. workers, involved. This result stands in strong contrastto that of studies which emphasize the lack of workers' support for works councilsand which postulate that the works councils have not yet been successfullyinstitutionalised (e.g. Jander and Lutz 1993; Mahnkopf 1991: 280 pp; Lippold et al.1992: 92; Spangenberg 1993: 20). Finally, this data provides a first indication that thecurrent problems of the East German works councils are far more likely to be causedby structural factors (i.e. recession, restructuring of the industry) than by internalfactors (i.e. institutional deficiencies, lacking support of workforce) or indeedmanagement strategies.ReferencesIndustrielle Beziehungen, 4.
