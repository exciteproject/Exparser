Region and RegionalizationREGION AND REGIONALIZATIONAndrey ShastitkoCOMPETITIVENESSOF THE REGION:CONTENT, FACTORS,POLICIESThe article describes a framework concep-tion of regional competitiveness. The notion ofregional competitiveness as well as approachesto the classification of competitiveness factorsare considered in detail. The author elaboratesa set of indicators of regional competitiveness.The article also discusses three groups offactors which can influence the competitive-ness of any region.Key words: region, competition,competitiveness, location based competi-tion, exogenous factors of regional com-petitiveness, endogenous factors of re-gional competitiveness.Competitiveness is a popular term which is used by economists, offi-cials, and policy-makers to justify actions that should be implemented inorder to improve the status of an object relative to other objects having simi-lar characteristics, in terms of its performance compared to other objects ofthe same class. In particular, industrial policy is seen as a set of activitiesaimed at improving competitiveness of certain categories of producers (e. g.national producers), or goods (services)1 manufactured in the country (re-gion).However, despite the widespread use of the concept of competitivenessin general and that of competitiveness of the region in particular, there areoften quite serious difficulties with offering an operational concept of com-petitiveness, especially when it concerns the content of the term.The phenomenon of regional competitiveness implies a complex of char-acteristics, each of which is essential for understanding this phenomenon asa whole. Indeed, the phenomenon of competitiveness in the socio-economic1 We will not consider the criteria of belonging to the category of domestic produc-ers. We will only note that it is not a trivial issue, because the mere fact that goodsand services are produced on a specific territory (in this case in Russia or the terri-tory of a region) is not a sufficient reason to qualify it as a domestic or regionalproducer.10Andrey Shastitkosystem can hardly be considered outside the relevant context of interactionbetween the actors, without defining the characteristics of competitiveness,or without identification of the necessary criteria to assess the level of com-petitiveness or its modifications. These aspects are closely intertwined, thatis why an orderly presentation of their conjunction is essential for the forma-tion of a unified vision of competitiveness of any subject in general (includ-ing companies, organizations, national economy, etc.), and the region inparticular.The main goal of this article is to formulate a framework of the conceptof regional competitiveness. The “framework” of the concept implies, firstand foremost, a number of general issues of regional competitiveness, whichshould be specified in relation to a specific territory (a region or a group ofregions).Achieving the goal involves a set of tasks, including:• identification and description of the key components of the theory ofcompetition by location;• elaboration of the content of regional competitiveness as an analyticaltool necessary to define a strategy for regional development;• identification of the factors conditioning the competitiveness of a region;• elaboration of regional competitiveness indicators;• use of non-quantification characteristics of the region's competitiveness.We will assume that a region is a relatively separate area with a set ofcharacteristics significant in terms of economic exchanges in general, andentrepreneurship, in particular, but at the same time not possessing suchattributes of national sovereignty as its own currency, armed forces, foreignpolicy and, therefore, not providing services such as: national security andmacroeconomic stability. Isolation of the territory may be manifested indifferent forms, ranging from the existence of customs borders, either defacto or de jure, to simply registration of a company as a legal entity in agiven territory. It is necessary to emphasize that regions may differ in someindividual characteristics of their institutional environment, for instance thecapacity of regional authorities to establish formal rules and mechanisms andto ensure compliance with all these rules, both formal and informal.1. Location-based competitionThe understanding of the competitiveness of the region, as one of its im-portant features, is largely dependent on the content of the notion of compe-tition because competitiveness virtually refers to the subject and/or the resultof a certain activity, while competition is a situation, or a process wherethis competitiveness occurs (and/or is formed) irrespective of the categoryof subjects, which participants of competition belong to (business entities,national economies, regions, etc.)In other words, competitiveness occurs when a subject, whose competi-tiveness is being characterized, is in a privileged position vis-à-vis otheractors/ subjects or at least does not worsen its position in relation to otheractors (competitors). That is why, it is important to understand that there is a11Region and Regionalizationconjunction between the notion of competition and competitiveness, andthere is a separate issue of identification (including a quantitative one) of thedegree of preponderance through a set of indicators.That is why understanding the content and possible forms of competitioncreates an essential condition for giving a systemic definition and study ofthe problem of competitiveness. Before we touch upon various types ofcompetition, it should be noted that the understanding of competition is alsovaried. However, our task does not include a detailed analysis of the contentof competition and major consequences that the chosen definition implies.We will focus on two approaches to defining competition: the static anddynamic ones.In accordance with the static approach, competition is a situation inwhich achievement of the goal by one subject is at the same time effec-tively limited by the competitor’s desire to achieve the same goal. To putit otherwise, the key feature of static competition is inaccessibility of thesame “benefit” for several subjects simultaneously. Though availability ofthe same benefit for different subjects is possible if the benefit is public (oneof the distinguishing features is absence of competition in consumption. Forexample, the emergence of additional viewers of fireworks does not lead toinaccessibility of the fireworks as a spectacle for others2).In accordance with the dynamic approach, competition is a process ofdiscovering new opportunities for the use of the already known re-sources, as well as a process of using or creating new resources [4]. Sincethe discovery of new opportunities is often associated with the use of infor-mation and exchange of knowledge in society, competition can also be seenas a process of identifying and sharing knowledge and information aboutquality, and about alternatives to using various resources in various possiblevariants of their use [1, p. 316].Unless it is specified otherwise, in future we will use the term competi-tion in its static understanding, when dealing with the problem of competi-tiveness of the region without special emphasis on the composition andchange of structure of the political market at the regional level. We will onlynote that the functioning of the political market may lead to both wideningand narrowing of opportunities for entrepreneurial activities which are fo-cused on creating value rather than its redistribution or destruction. It doesnot follow from what has been said that the dynamic approach to the defini-tion of competition is inapplicable to the situation of interaction of economicagents on the goods and service market while determining competitivenessof the object under research.Forms of competition, in the static sense, are manifold. In particular, it iswell known that economic theory distinguishes between the following typesof competition: price and non-price competition, fair and unfair, current andintertemporal, product and location, ex ante and ex post, for the market andin the market, as well as actual and potential ones.2 Strictly speaking, this benefit can be attributed to the «transferred» to public, whenafter a certain point the marginal cost of providing this service begins growing.12Andrey ShastitkoBoth the content of competition and competitive characteristics largelydepend on the properties of the product, which is the result of performanceof a corresponding subject, a party of competition. For example, if a product(for example, a new computer programme) can easily cross the border butregistering the very fact of its production in the country requires significantcosts, then other factors of regional competitiveness such as, for example,quality of life of the product’s manufacturer will be of importance.If we regard competition between economic agents in the market as areference point and assume that the agents belong to the same market (interms of their product and geographic boundaries), which actually meansidentical location, then this factor has no independent importance from thepoint of view of competition. Weakening of this assumptions leads to thefollowing conclusions:(1) location may affect the conditions of actual competition (and, conse-quently, the competitiveness of the producer);(2) location should be taken into account when assessing potential com-petition and corresponding potential competitiveness.The second point is important in case the actors do not compete directlyas they work on different markets, but the parameters of their activities, aswell as the results, are comparable. This mechanism is known as yardstickcompetition [5].Economic activity in general and entrepreneurship in particular, occur ata certain time and in a certain place. Territorial identity, when the same en-tity can not be located in different areas, or in other words, when the samelegal entity is registered in different regions and can not simultaneouslycarry out the same activity in different regions, is very important because itis a basis of location-based competition.In its pure form, location-based competition will operate as follows.Let’s assume that there are some isolated areas among which there are somerandomly distributed economic unit creating a certain value. Each economicunit is the centre of decision-making, and the decisions reflect the interestsof the entity controlling the unit.If the terms of interaction with other economic units and between thisunit and the entity in control of the territory are less favourable than else-where, then for the decision maker in the given economic unit there emergeincentives for the relocation of its economic activity to another territory. Allother things being equal, ceteris paribus, the more favourable the conditionsof entrepreneurial activity in the region, the more entrepreneurs would runtheir business in the region. Moreover, it is important to note that this is notnecessarily true only speaking about the transfer of a business from one re-gion to another. Competition can also take place indirectly when businessdevelops as a result of decisions made by those who live in this or that re-gion and decide to set up their own business3. As a result, the number of3 It is important to make one reservation: we do not consider specific issues of spe-cialization of a territory in production of a certain class of products; the default as-sumption is that comparative advantages are important, but are not a sole determi-nant of economic profile of the territory.13Region and Regionalizationbusiness registration and the number of businesses per a fixed number ofpeople (usually per 1000) grow.It is clear that for effective location-based competition, many conditionsmust be fulfilled. But the most important one is that the expected net profitfrom the transfer from one territory to another (taking into account the dis-count) must not be less than the cost of business transfer, that is, the costs tobe paid by the specified entity to move the business from one territory toanother.The costs of business transfer are crucial to ensure the effectiveness ofcompetition ex post, i.e., for those businesses that are already operating inthe territory of one of the regions. The effectiveness of competition ex postdepends largely on the development level of the markets infrastructure, in-cluding the markets for the buying/selling of businesses (especially whenthis is a small and medium size business, which practically does not usestock exchange mechanisms [3]), housing and other real estate, and labour.The functioning of infrastructure markets involves a physical movement ofeconomic agents in territorial space (in economic theory, this kind of move-ment, in the context of competition, is called “voting with one’s feet”).In addition, consideration should be given to two more options for abusiness — switching to the shadow scheme or abandoning business all to-gether. In this case, the region's competitiveness as such should be separatedfrom the competitiveness of formal institutions, regulating the activities ofeconomic agents, and the competitiveness of similar institutions that regulatethe same activity but are outside the framework of government regulationsand security of property rights.We would also like to emphasize that at the categorial level, there shouldbe a distinction between attractiveness (competitiveness) of the region forentrepreneurship and that for living (free time consumption). The better thetransportation infrastructure, the higher the differentiation of the neighbour-ing regions in their living conditions (the cost and quality of housing, envi-ronment, etc.), the more actual the distinction becomes.2. Competitiveness of the territoryUnderstanding the notion of the competitiveness of the territory islargely dependent on the context it is used in. Obviously, while studyinginterregional links, first and foremost, there emerges a thesis of international,interregional and, in general, inter-territorial trade. From this perspective, thefundamental rationale behind the direction of the movement of goods and,respectively, specialization is comparative advantages resulting from differ-ent opportunities, alternative costs of goods production on these territories.For all the complexity of modern theory of international trade, the basicidea is simple. Territories (countries, regions) can, technically speaking,produce the same (or quite intersecting) set of goods. However, an increasein the volume of production of the same product will be directly related todifferent levels of reduction in the production of other goods for differentcountries.14Andrey ShastitkoHowever, one should take into account two important considerationswhich are crucial for understanding the content of the region's competitive-ness and conditions for its raising.Firstly, in the theoretical models comparative advantages are initial con-ditions for explaining the direction and scale of trade between territories.However, in practice, identification of these comparative advantages in acomplex, diversified economy is a separate issue. Accordingly, the moreprecise the mechanism with the help of which the comparative advantage isrevealed, the higher the competitiveness of the territory is. However, oneshould admit that in bilateral trade, inadequacy in identifying the compara-tive advantage may have a negative impact on trade partners.Secondly, one can imagine a fairly unique, but yet an important casewhen two countries' alternative costs of production of a fixed set of goodsare the same. The differences are only in the direct costs associated withproductivity factors. Does this mean that the two countries (or two regions)are equally competitive? It is clear that substantial differences in productiv-ity come from the characteristics of the regions, for example, from the regu-latory regime.Competitiveness is a relative (comparative) characteristic of the sub-ject of actual or potential competition, regardless of the characteristics ofcompetition. As can be seen from the previous statement, it is necessary todistinguish between competitiveness of an individual business entity (indus-try) and the region's competitiveness. In terms of the market functioningscheme, competitiveness of the region derives from the competitiveness ofits enterprises. The higher (lower) the competitiveness of enterprises, otherthings being equal, the higher (lower) the region's competitiveness is. In itsturn, in the first approximation, competitiveness of an enterprise is expressedin terms of how efficiently the production factors are used and what theprices of these factors are. However, it should be born in mind that compa-nies may belong to different sectors of economy; they may be different insize, and in their organizational and legal forms. That is why, the specifiedratio is more complex in its character.In addition, there is no uniform understanding of the competitiveness ofa separate business, industry or national economy in economic literature. InYassin and Yakovleva’s [7, p. 8] works there is a working definition of thecompetitiveness of goods and services, which is the “ability to sell them[goods and services — A. Sh.] at market prices getting normal profit”. Bydefault, it is assumed that the long term survival of a business in the marketis possible only if its average total costs are not lower than the market price,which corresponds to the conditions of equilibrium in a competitive market.However, as it was already indicated above, the static approach to thedefinition of competition is not the only possible one. In principle, there arefive basic approaches to resolve the issue of operationalization of the con-cept of competitiveness4:4 These results were obtained based on a study carried out by the “Bureau of Eco-nomic Analysis” Foundation in 2001.15Region and Regionalization1. A simple approach based on a comparison of certain traditional sepa-rate indirect indicators of productivity and competitiveness at the level of anindustry and national economies;2. An approach based on the M. Porter’s competitive forces model iden-tifying competitive advantages of national economies;3. An approach based on an assessment of inefficiency of the firm (com-pared with best current practices) and a construction of a regression modelso as to explain the reasons for such inefficiency (the OCRA model);4. Hypotheses about the directions of labour specialization as a factor inimproving the competitiveness of firms.5. An approach based on the calculation of competitiveness indicatorsfor the industry/company performance through the competitiveness of goods.It should be noted that the names/terms used here, are not universally ac-cepted but reflect the essence, the main characteristics of the describedmethodology.The task of elaborating the concept of the region’s competitiveness, de-spite the relative simplicity of the general idea that can be laid at the founda-tion of this concept, in fact may prove much more difficult than competitive-ness of a branch of industry or a business.Competitive location, in the first approximation, actually means that theregion is competitive; it can be viewed through the prism of contractual rela-tionship between an entrepreneur (investor) and regional authorities. Thisdoes not mean that such a contract must exist explicitly. Typically, there is ahidden, implicit contract, which, however, can be reconstructed with the helpof the tools of economic analysis.Since direct investments, if we do not take into account bank loans, aresubject to greater or lesser territorial fixedness, especially when it comes tothe construction of buildings, as well as to installing equipment which isdifficult to transport distance-wise, the principal concern for the investor isnot only the proposed conditions, but also guarantees that (a) they will notchange and (b) that the alleged conditions are consistent with the actual con-ditions (rules and mechanisms to ensure compliance with them will be con-sistent with each other). In other words, the task of regional authorities is toensure credibility of their commitments. Moreover, de facto the right to as-sess reliability of this kind of promises is granted to business community.Furthermore, this reliability consists of at least two parts. The first relatesto the reliability of the commitments of the regional authorities to createsuch conditions, whereas the second is the reliability of commitments of theauthorities at a higher level, which, in terms of the classification factors ofcompetitiveness, can be attributed to exogenous ones.However, as in any contractual relationship, the problems arising fromthe formulation of commitments and ensuring compliance with them arereciprocal. That is why the fulfilment of any agreement implies that the reli-ability of commitments concerning the proposed entrepreneurial activity iscomplemented by measures of control and effective restrictions on miscon-duct and violations of the rules likely to be committed by economic entities.16Andrey ShastitkoCompetitiveness of the region is closely intertwined with its economicdevelopment, so the relation between the two phenomena requires specialattention.If competition between regions for attracting business is aimed at creat-ing value, then economic development can be regarded as a consequence ofthis kind of competition. Consequently, competitiveness and economic de-velopment of the region are positively linked.A distinction should be drawn between economic development and eco-nomic growth, due to possible changes in the resulting macro-economic indica-tors in the first place, and the gross regional product, without innovation as a keyfeature of economic development. In other words, economic growth is onlypossible if there is an increasing the amount of resources and they are efficientlyused, while technology may remain unchanged, so may the assortment range ofproducts, acting organizational forms, a set of resources, as well as the marketcomposition of goods and services that the regions use.Competitiveness, defined as survival of a business entity on the market,is not linked explicitly to efficiency (at least in the short term perspective).This may be due to the fact that business actors, competing with each other,may have fundamentally different stocks of resources.Let us consider in more detail the relationship between competitivenessand economic development. At first glance, the relationship between com-petitiveness and economic development is simple and unambiguous: themore competitive the region is, the faster its economic development and viceversa — the faster the economic development, the higher the competitive-ness. However, when analyzing the relationship between the two phenom-ena, a number of circumstances should be taken into account.1. The definition of competitiveness, as a rule, implies a correlation ofone entity and the other at the same point of time because competition takesplace in real time. In its turn, economic development is determined by a cor-relation of successive emerging states of the same object. One exception isintertemporal competition, when a business entity actually competes withitself by supplying the market with durable goods.2. It is also possible to define competitiveness of producers outside thecontext of economic development as situations in which, according to J.Schumpeter, there are no new combinations which are being important signsof economic development. It is clear that this is only a theoretical abstractionwhich shows that one phenomenon (competitiveness) is not identical to theother (economic development).3. However, an increase of competitiveness is related in an even morecomplex way with economic development, because the way how to raisecompetitiveness is of great significance. If it involves the creation of incen-tives for economic agents to seek new ways of productive and efficient useof the existing limited resources, and/or discover new resources, in this casethe factors enhancing competitiveness also act as economic developmentfactors. But if an increase of competitiveness of business entities, as well asterritories, is due to the industrial policy, resulting in a meaningful redistri-bution of scarce resources in favour of certain categories of industries or17Region and Regionalizationproducers, then as a consequence of distortion of incentives, these factors,which are seemingly increasing the competitiveness of goods, do not createsufficient incentives for economic development.The main conclusion is that the content of economic development of theregion, considered in the context of competition between regions in the fieldof business development and focused on creating value, and the content ofcompetitiveness of the region largely overlap.3. Factors of regional competitivenessIf competitiveness of the region is a relative characteristic of a territory,defined in the context of competition as a certain process, then circum-stances, actions of people, or groups of people, who have an impact on thespecified characteristics of the region will be defined as factors of competi-tiveness.Taking into account a close interconnection and, at the same time, someambiguity in the correlation between economic development and the com-petitiveness of the region, it should be noted that the relation between them,described in the previous section, is reflected in the factors of economic de-velopment and competitiveness, respectively.The classification of economic development factors of the region wascarried out by L. A. Grigoriev and Y. Urozhaeva [2]. In accordance withtheir classification, three groups of factors are identified: “natural” (objec-tive), factors external to the region and institutional ones. Accepting the ba-sis of the proposed classification, we would like to point out, however, thatthe above mentioned classification does not meet the requirements of thetheoretical classification, since the classification grounds are not clearly de-fined and many factors within the groups may partly overlap. This fact willbe taken into account in the further discussion of the issue of the factors ofthe competitiveness of the region. Since the region’s competitiveness (itsincrease or sustaining its high level) is the goal of socio-economic policies,there is also a practical question of how this goal can be achieved.We can formulate several working criteria for a classification of the fac-tors of the region’s competitiveness:(1) the significance of the factor;(2) the dependence of the factor on decisions taken by actors in thesocio-economic policies in the region;(3) duration of the factor (short, medium and long term ones).The following sections focus on the exogenous and endogenous factorsof competitiveness, i. e. factors of the second group. That is why, in thissection we will briefly comment on two other groups as well. In terms oftheir impact on the level of competitiveness, the factors are not equal. Forexample, if one considers the change in GDP as a reflection of entrepreneu-rial activity, then among such factors as human capital, macroeconomic pol-icy, and the quality of institutions the latter is most significant5 [9]. By insti-5 Note that some researchers point to interdependence of macroeconomic policy andquality of institutions.18Andrey Shastitkotutions we mean rules (formal and informal), as well as mechanisms to en-sure compliance with them, including arrangements relating to the applica-tion of sanctions to violators. Accordingly, if one compares the relative dy-namics of the GDP during a reasonably long period of time, it will broadlyreflect the quality of institutions.Exogenous factors are such factors of regional competitiveness, anychange in which is not a direct consequence of economic decisions andactions, taken at the level of the region.Exogenous factors include, first of all, institutional conditions of eco-nomic activity reflected in the federal laws; they are connected to mecha-nisms ensuring compliance with these laws through federal institutions andtheir territorial branches. There is only one limitation: if this region is notdominant in terms of creating system rules.In this context decentralization and deregulation of economy can be im-portant factors of enhancing competitiveness of peripheral regions, when theright to make meaningful decisions and the corresponding tax sources aredelegated to the level of the region.Integration processes in economies, that create a need for decisions re-lated to business development at a larger scope than that of one particularregion, are of great importance too. First of all, it refers to large integratedbusiness groups (IBG). On the one hand, decisions concerning IBGs affectmany regions at once, so the influence on the behaviour of any IBG, whichpresupposes reaching a certain “critical mass”, involves problems of a col-lective action of the regions concerned. However, as a rule, IBGs make stra-tegic decisions without any interaction with a group of interested regions.At the same time, the number of IBGs whose interests are represented inthe region can be an important factor, just as important as the location of theheadquarters. As it was already mentioned, the presence of a large number ofIBGs in the region greatly diminishes the problem of dependence of regionaldecisions on the interests of one separate IBG, particularly if IBGs are het-erogeneous.Another group of exogenous factors is associated with the state of keyresources before business entities, operating in the region and affecting itscompetitiveness, make a decision. This is due to the fact that the history ofthe region is important; it makes an impact on the competitiveness of differ-ent forms of accumulated capital — human, physical and social, if the latterimplies a set of institutions.Finally, another group of factors involves changes which are exogenousboth, in relation to the actions of the federal government and in relation tothe business behaviour of a vast majority of IBGs.In particular, we are speaking about changes in the world commodity mar-kets, as they are an important component of production in a corresponding re-gion and export from the country in general. For Russia, this is, above all, en-ergy (oil and gas), as well as products of ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy.However, it should be understood that within a fairly narrow food segmentthere is a possibility of influence of the players’ decisions in the national econ-omy, in terms of economic exchanges across the world market, which in its turncould have the opposite effect on the competitiveness of a region.19Region and RegionalizationThus, exogenous factors include:(1) decisions of the federal government (including decision to devaluethe national currency, decision about privatization or nationalization of cer-tain objects);(2) decisions made in integrated business groups, whose activities arecarried out simultaneously in many regions;(3) accumulated characteristics of production factors (fixed capital stock,human capital, natural resources, organizational capital);(4) fluctuations in world commodity markets.All the factors listed above are not exogenous by definition if, for example, aregion itself or together with other regions can influence the decision of impor-tant issues for the region (e.g., elaboration of the regional industrial policy).Endogenous factors are such factors of regional competitiveness, thechange of value of which is a direct consequence of decisions and actionsof the economic policy at the level of the region.One of the most important endogenous factors of the competitiveness ofthe region is socio-economic policy of the authorities that affects the price,which economic agents have to pay for services provided by the regionalauthorities (institutional infrastructure, real infrastructure) and the quality ofthese services. It has to be noted that a reduction in prices in the form ofeasing the tax burden can be considered as a factor enhancing competitive-ness of the region, which, nevertheless, can be outweighed by other factors;firstly, due to poor quality of services, especially public benefits, and sec-ondly, due to diminishing competitiveness in the future (a decrease in re-gional public finance).There is another aspect of the influence of socio-economic policies on theregion's competitiveness. Most clearly it can be seen in the ratio of industrial andcompetition policies. Industrial policy is a redistribution of resources tar-geted at specific industries or groups of companies. Competition policyaims at creating incentives for economic agents in terms of generating in-novation (technological, product, and organizational) by means of creationand maintenance of competitive conditions in the target markets.Strictly speaking, the establishment of formal institutions is the onlyfactor which the authorities can control. This factor affects the competitive-ness of the region through incentives for those economic agents who makedecisions related to the creation of value, and also (if it would be preferable),redistribution of value or even its destruction. From this perspective, loca-tion competitiveness is, above all, competitiveness of institutions (na-tional and regional).In accordance with the approach proposed by Yassin and Yakovleva [7,p. 8], the competitiveness of institutions is the compliance of formal andnon-formal institutions in the country (laws, norms and traditions of behav-iour of the authorities, use of power, degree of freedom, the radius of trust)with the requirements of production of competitive goods and services. Inconnection with the given definition it is important to say the following:1. One can speak about not only the competitiveness of national institu-tions, but also regional institutions competitiveness;20Andrey Shastitko2. It is necessary to confine to formal and informal rules governing theinteraction between economic agents, as well as the interaction of economicagents with state authorities;3. Mechanisms ensuring compliance with the established rules should beregarded as a special component of institutions. Rules for permitted (or pro-hibited) actions should be consistent with best practices. But this is notenough for the elaboration of adequate incentives.4. Indicators of regional competitivenessThe effect of the factors of regional competitiveness determine the char-acteristics of the region, which were described in the second section in thecontext of determining the quality characteristics that affect the incentives ofindividuals taking economic decisions.However, in order to operationalize this conception, it is important toidentify indicators of competitiveness.As there are many factors as well indicators of competitiveness, it is nec-essary to streamline them and analyze their relation to one another. The firstsubsection deals with specific indicators of competitiveness which reflectsome aspects of the business agent’s performance. The second subsectiondeals with the problem of formulating a generalized indicator of competi-tiveness. The third subsection identifies indicators associated with competi-tiveness.Specific indicator is an indicator of the region's competitiveness,which reflects a subset of location competition aspects.In accordance with the existing standard approaches used to quantifycompetitiveness, one can single out the following indicators: (1) productivitylevel (2) labour cost per production unit, (3) the coefficient of identifiedcomparative advantages.If the theory of international trade is taken as a starting point, then thekey indicator is associated with the comparative advantages of the country(region). In research, the coefficient of identified comparative advantages isused; it is calculated as the ratio of the share of the country (region) in theworld (national) market of the product (export) to the share of the country'simports of this product (import from other regions6 [7, p. 16]).Mathematically, this coefficient can be represented as follows [8]:RCAi = (Xi /Σ Xi — Mi/Σ Mi) · 100,where RCAi is the coefficient of the identified comparative advantageswhich, theoretically, can change from -100 to 100, Xi/ΣXi is the country’sshare of world export, Mi / ΣMi is the country’s share of world import.It should be noted at once that this indicator is not practicable for regionsfor lack of adequate statistics on the movement of goods between regions(without crossing national borders).6 Adjustment to the definition of the regional component is presented by the authorof the article.21Region and RegionalizationAmong the indicators that reflect individual aspects of the region's com-petitiveness one can also take into account direct investments, changingnumbers of small enterprises per 1000 inhabitants (adjusted for the propor-tion of non-operating SMEs), actually reflecting the intensity of the businessregistration process.The greater the number of SMEs per capita, given all other conditionsbeing equal, the more competitive the region is. In this thesis, the principleof “other conditions being equal” is essential. It is clear that “traces” of re-gional competitiveness can also be found in retrospect if we assume that thedynamics of key indicators is the result of location-based competition. Thisapplies, above all, to such indicators as GRP, including GDP per capita,current investments and others.Among the most obvious indicators of competitiveness to be applied isthe amount of added value per worker. As the impact of economic activity isestimated through added value, thus the more value is added in the region,ceteris paribus, the more competitive the business operating in the region is,and, consequently, the more competitive the region is (if one uses the logicof competition by location in association with the region's competitivenesson the one hand, and the correlation between the region's competitivenessand competitiveness of the region's products, manufactured in the territory,on the other). However, in most cases data on added value is not available.Generalized indicator of competitiveness is the one that takes intoaccount all major aspects of competitiveness. The generalized indicator ofcompetitiveness is unlikely to have any dimension: it is, probably, a numeralas is, for example, the indicator of elasticity. Approaches to the calculationmechanism of this numeral may be different.1. One option: one can calculate the average fraction for the entire set ofmajor factors affecting competitiveness, assessing the significance and roleof each factor. If the value of this indicator for a particular region is aboveaverage, then the region is competitive.2. Another option: choosing, as a starting point, the best value for the en-tire set and comparing it with specific values obtained for the region. In thiscase the value can not be greater than one (1), although it is possible that thisvalue will be equal to 1 (for the leader region).3. The third option: the reference point is maximum possible values ofthe indicators, whereas the actual values for each region indicate deviationsdue to the untapped reserves. In this case, the standard value would be lessthan one (1) for all regions (including the leader region).Among important indicators and characteristics of the region (which arerelated to its competitiveness, but do not exhaust its full content, though theyare used as stand-alone characteristics of this region), one can point out in-vestment attractiveness of the region and the regional budgets reflected inthe ratings of paying capacity.In the comparative assessment of any region, various kinds of ratings are oftenused as they can help sort out the regions according to the established criteria.It should be noted that investment attractiveness ratings may indicate thespecialization of the region, if we assume that in the world markets there arerelatively stable favourable conditions for goods that are consistent with thespecialization of the region. That is why, there can be a positive correlation22Andrey Shastitkobetween the level of investment attractiveness and competitiveness of theregion but it is not as strong as it may seem at first glance.As the region is the subject of location-based competition, the state ofthe regional budget is very important, because it reflects not only the currentbut also future regime of entrepreneurial activity in the region. Indeed, if thebudget of the region is made with a significant deficit, and is financedthrough borrowings in the financial market and financing of medium-andlong-term programmes is implemented through the “short” money, then interms of attractiveness, ceteris paribus, the region will lose.5. Enhancing competitiveness of the region with the helpof measures of socioeconomic policies at the regional levelUnderstanding the content of competitiveness in positive terms is ofgreat importance for the development of socio-economic policies, both at thelevel of economy as a whole and at the level of the region, given a set ofexogenous and endogenous factors (variables). Interdependence of variousaspects of competitiveness with social and economic policy has many impor-tant aspects, two of which we will pay special attention to.There are three groups of tools, which can affect competitiveness of the re-gion. They are applicable to both national governments as well as regional ones.1. General measures to strengthen the regional economy and its positionin national and world economy, leading eventually to an increase of com-petitiveness of firms and their products. Such measures shall provide thebasis for competitiveness for national economy and that of the region. Thesegeneral measures include, first and foremost, institutional framework foreconomic activities, related to the formation of business environment, re-gardless of the expected gains of specific groups of businesses.2. State aid in the form of direct support to companies in their export ac-tivities (grants, tax incentives, exemption from import duties on raw materi-als, information support of export activities). For the regional governmentthis direction is less accessible than for the federal government (there is noway to exempt from import duties on raw materials), as well as it involvesthe risk of applying to them the norms of the federal law “On protection ofcompetition” in the event their activity restricts competition.3. Measures aimed at creating demand for regional producers in otherregions, as well as foreign markets (exhibitions, establishment abroad or inother regions trade and information centres, etc.)These measures are not completely equivalent in terms of setting appro-priate incentives. However, they form a space for choice both in normalconditions and in the conditions of a crisis. In this regard it should be notedthat the region's competitiveness will largely depend on the balance of meas-ures aimed at improving its competitiveness.Given the fact that the competitiveness of the region derives from thecompetitiveness of products manufactured in its territory, identification ofstrategies for improving the region's competitiveness in the context of im-proving the competitiveness of the industries is of vital importance. It isclear that the impact of efforts aimed at improving competitiveness of indus-23Region and Regionalizationtries will be different. Moreover, it is understandable that it is rational toresolve issues related to enhancement of competitiveness of the region, fo-cusing on enhancement of competitiveness of the industry with a biggercompetitiveness potential.In this perspective there emerges a separate issue of a group of indus-tries, both in terms of potential impact of improving competitiveness and interms of tools that can be used to enhance this competitiveness.Problems with the use of indicators of competitiveness in quality controlactually minimize the risk of manipulating them. Let's try to explain the es-sence of the problem. Let’s assume that all players use the assumption thatthe proposed indicators are adequate, in terms of comparative assessment ofthe region (its competitiveness).If the welfare of a player depends on the level or the dynamics of this indica-tor, there is a stimulus for a corresponding change of the indicator. Moreover,the actors will look for ways to achieve this goal with minimum expenditures.For example, if the dynamics of labour productivity is taken as a control indica-tor, it might, other things being equal, encourage the use of labour-saving, capi-tal-intensive technologies. However, in the circumstances where a relativelycheap labour is a competitive advantage, in terms of resources, the choice of thisindicator may lead to reduced competitiveness (at least in some areas).The assessment of competitiveness of the region involves a necessity totake into account factors which are impossible or rather difficult to quantify.This is especially true for factors that are actually very complicated, interms of structure. Among them is the quality of the institutional environ-ment at the regional level, including not only the content of laws, but alsomechanisms ensuring compliance with them.In this respect, so as to solve this issue, it is necessary to pay more atten-tion to the characteristics of the institutional framework concerning the useof limited resources, paying special attention to the significance of each ofthe identified characteristics.Understanding the above-mentioned issue will ensure more cautionwhen applying all quantitative estimates of all changes in competitivenessand, on the one hand, will encouraged seeking methods of quantification for“non-quantifiable”, for the time being, factors, on the other hand.ConclusionsThe presented material on regional competitiveness provides the follow-ing conclusions:1. Competitiveness of the region is an important component in explain-ing both the level of economic development and the living standards in theregion. That is why improving competitiveness of the region is an importanttask of economic policy at both the federal and regional levels;2. Currently there is no generally accepted, rigorous and operationaldefinition of the term “competitiveness”, applicable to all cases of empiricalresearch in this area. This concerns the definition of the term in relation tospecific products or manufacturers, as well as to individual regions.3. However, competitiveness in the long run should be consideredthrough the prism of setting incentives for decision makers to seek new ar-24Andrey Shastitkoeas, to use the already known resources, as well as to identify unknown exante resources of creating added value. This applies to business entities andto those decision makers who determine the quality of the institutional envi-ronment in the territory. This approach is based on interdependence of thenotions “competition” and “competitiveness”.4. Competitiveness of the region depends on many factors which can beclassified. In terms of decision-making process the most important groupsare endogenous and exogenous factors of competitiveness.5. In applied research a variety of techniques are used to assess competi-tiveness on the basis of designing a set of indicators, each of which has com-parative advantages and shortcomings. Among the most common are suchindicators as a comparative advantage, productivity and cost of labour perunit of output. The choice of methods for assessing competitiveness dependson the objective and accessible information. It should be born in mind thatavailable information is not always significant, and important information isnot always available. The ideal method applicable to all cases of assessmentof competitiveness has not been identified yet.6. It is necessary to distinguish between competitiveness of manufactur-ers in the industry and market. If competitiveness of manufacturers in themarket is directly linked to the level of unit costs, competitiveness within theindustry (manufacturing heterogeneous and not always easily interchange-able commodities) is linked to an additional factor — the choice of speciali-zation which adequately reflects the manufacturer’s comparative advantage.In its turn competitiveness of the region implies not only the cost factor butalso specific institutional conditions of production, which should lead todifferentiation of the producer’s costs not only because of natural compara-tive advantages or benefits in the organization, but because of differences incosts associated with compliance with the mandatory requirements estab-lished by the State (at the federal and regional levels).Bibliography1. <ref>Алчян А.
