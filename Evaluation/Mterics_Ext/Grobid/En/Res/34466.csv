The cases offer surprising evidence for the resurgence of progressive activ-ism in America, at a critical historical juncture in which contrasting perspectives contend forprominence – Washington consensus versus Seattle coalition, employer-driven de-unionization versus union-led mobilization, corporate power and corruption versus labor-inclusive social movement upsurge, and in the global arena, unilateral domination versusmultilateral negotiation. Predominantly local, the coalitions examined in this research, takentogether across the United States, amount to a substantial movement for broad economicand social policy reform, an American movement with potentially global ramifications. Theargument presented here contends that this revitalization of social forces in the U.S. is sig-nificant enough to need explanation, and presents evidence pointing toward key causalforces at work: chronic inequality, strategic leadership, and coalition building.Arbeiterbewegung und globale Gerechtigkeit.Neue Reformkoalitionen in der einzigen Supermacht der WeltThema dieses Beitrags sind neu erstarkte Arbeiter-, Umwelt- und Studentenbewegungen in denUSA, die in Fallstudien über deren Kampagnen (Lebensstandard, Anti-Sweatshop, nachhaltigeEntwicklung und Justice for Janitors) untersucht werden. Die Fallbeispiele dokumentieren überra-schende Evidenzen für die Wiederbelebung eines progressiven Aktivismus in Amerika an einerkritischen Wegscheide mit konstrastierenden Perspektiven – Washington-Konsensus versusSeattle-Koalition, kapitalgesteuerte Antigewerkschaftskampagnen versus gewerkschaftlicheMobilisierung, unternehmerische Macht und Korruption versus Arbeiter- und soziale Bewe-gung, und in der globalen Arena: unilaterale Dominanz versus multilaterale Aushandlung.Wenn die in diesem Beitrag beschriebenen Koalitionen auch vorwiegend lokalen Charakterhaben, stellen sie doch, zählt man sie zusammen, eine substanzielle Bewegung für breite öko-nomische und soziapolitische Reformen dar, eine amerikanische Bewegung mit globalen Ver-zweigungen. Vertreten wird das Argument, dass die Revitalisierung der sozialen Kräfte in denUSA bedeutsam genug ist, um nach einer Erklärung zu verlangen, und dass die Evidenzen aufdie Kausalität zentraler Kräfte verweisen: auf chronische Ungleichheit, strategische Führer-schaft und Koalitionsbildung.Key words: Unions, labor revitalization, coalition building, comparativepolitical economy, American politics___________________________________________________________________***Lowell Turner is professor of international and comparative labor at Cornell University,School of Industrial and Labor Relations, Cornell University, 296 Ives Hall, Ithaca, NY14853-3901, USA.

Jg., Heft 1+2, 200493Since the Reagan/Thatcher era, there has been an air of inevitability about the growthof corporate power, the decline of labor unions, and the expansion of global capital-ism. The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union deepenedthe sense of irreversible market triumph. The only remaining superpower has led thecharge toward an increasingly deregulated, “unleashed” global economy.Yet both organized and theoretical opposition to the dominant global vision aregrowing. In recent years an alternative vision has begun to take shape and to gain inpolitical viability. The “Battle of Seattle” in late 1999 and subsequent mass demonstra-tions through 2002 in Prague, Quebec, Genoa, Porto Alegre and Barcelona, followedby massive world-wide antiwar demonstrations on February 15, 2003, have givenvoice to the opposition. Insiders such as Nobel Prize-winning economist JosephStiglitz (2002), former chief economist at the World Bank, have deepened their criti-cism of the IMF model and Washington consensus. A corporate corruption epidemicin 2002 undermined the legitimacy of unregulated markets and corporate power.The focus of this study1 is on the labor proponents of an emerging alternate vi-sion. The focus, in other words, is on the actors rather than what they are fighting for,since the reform vision is only beginning to take shape and will mean nothing withoutthe actors (such as unions) who promote, negotiate, revise, campaign for and imple-ment the new ideas and policies.If the dominant vision can be called market globalism, the emerging alternativepoints toward a more democratic globalism. After a broad overview to highlight core de-bates, this paper focuses on key U.S. unions and their coalitions, opposing the domi-nance of currently configured global capitalism – for the most part in battles at the lo-cal level – while gradually developing an alternative view. In the U.S., the relevant so-cial actors include most prominently revitalized labor, environmental, student and an-tiwar movements, in coalition with each other and a variety of other community, reli-gious, civil rights and political groups.This coalition-based research assumes that global reform conflicts will take shapenot as North-South, rich-poor, business-labor or even Empire-multitudes (Hardt andNegri 2000), but rather in wide-ranging, shifting coalitions of a multiplicity of actors –including national governments and international agencies as well as domestic and in-ternational labor, business and other NGO’s. The focus here on labor as a social forceinside the United States also assumes that reformist movements inside the one re-maining superpower are essential for the prospects of expanded global democracy.212For suggestions, critical comments and collaborative research, the author extends heart-felt thanks to colleagues Lee Adler, Brigid Beachler, Ian Greer, Marco Hauptmeier, JulieHodek, Richard Hurd, Otto Jacobi, Ritu Jain, Nathan Lillie, Julie Sadler and Jim Shoch.Funding for the research was provided by the Ford Foundation and the School ofIndustrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University.This is not meant to devalue the role of domestic and international labor coalitions else-where throughout the global North and South. Many unions in the U.S., in fact, are in-creasingly aware of the urgent need for cross-national and global coalitions (Gordon andTurner 2000; Nissen 2002). But the primary focus here is on labor-led domestic coalitionbuilding in the U.S., in the context of an increasingly global economy.94Lowell Turner: Labor and Global JusticeExplaining growing oppositionGreatly simplified, the central conflict within the global North finds multinationalcorporations and the U.S. government (and some of its allies) on one side, promotingmarket globalism, backed by and working with existing national and global institu-tions, with groupings of organized interests, social movements and other NGO’s onthe other side, beginning to mobilize for reform. The argument examined in this paperexplains the growing significance of reform forces with reference to three variables: vast domes-tic and global inequality (highlighted by recent corporate scandals); new leadership with abroadened strategic vision at key activist groups, including the AFL-CIO and several of itsleading unions; and a growing, contagious focus among activist groups on coalitionbuilding.While these variables may best explain the current upsurge of opposition to mar-ket (or corporate) globalism, they are together not enough to produce substantial de-mocratic reform in the global economy. Also required for successful reform, evidenceconsidered here suggests, are both an expanded capacity for grassroots mobilization (rely-ing on the “people power” that affords comparative advantage to these reformgroups) and a new political opportunity structure. The latter depends upon divisions amongestablished powers, including multinational corporations and rich country govern-ments. Corporate scandals that disinherit employees and investors, the European pushtoward a “social Europe,” trade conflicts among governments, intense differencesover war in Iraq, and conflicts between governments and WTO, IMF, World Bankand other international agencies all offer potential openings in the political opportu-nity structure.Economic circumstances (such as inequality) and political opportunity structures(including corporate scandals) are thus significant in shaping the prospects for a viableopposition to the dominant market globalism. The focus of this research is nonethe-less on strategic actors and their coalitions for reform. Unlike much social scienceanalysis that emphasizes constraints, barriers and (often insurmountable) problems,the actor-based theoretical approach offered here emphasizes possibilities and poten-tial breakthroughs. While we certainly need to understand the depths of the challengesfacing democratic reform efforts in the contemporary global economy – and researchthat explores the challenges and barriers is indispensable – revitalization research isalso essential in pointing toward opportunities for reform.After the presentation of core concepts and case study research, a brief reconsid-eration of the literature highlights the potential contributions of an actor-based revi-talization approach that focuses less on problem constellations than on efforts aimedat overcoming the problems.Contending visions of a global economyIn the wake of the cold war, as we build – or fail to build – a new world order, twocore debates have emerged. The first is between those who favor and those who op-pose the development of a global economy and society. Thomas Friedman has calledIndustrielle Beziehungen, 11. Jg., Heft 1+2, 200495this the debate over whether to globalize.3 In the chart below, the forces listed underFighting the Global Economy, alone or in various combinations, seek to counter and op-pose the modern push toward globalization. In so doing, these forces campaign pri-marily against the existing dominant market globalism, yet they also undermine thepotential foundations of democratic globalism.The second core debate is between what is here called market and democraticglobalism. Friedman refers to a debate over how to globalize. In various ways, the con-stituents of these two contending camps promote a global economy and to some ex-tent a global society as well. Against the nationalists, localists and fundamentalists ofall stripes, these are the internationalists of our era.CONTENDING VISIONS FOR A GLOBAL ECONOMYBuilding the Global EconomyMARKET GLOBALISMDeregulation, free trade and capital flows, maximum business discretion,current global architecture and institutions – WTO, IMF, WashingtonconsensusKey U.S.-based proponents: Multinational corporations, U.S. govern-ment (and neoclassical economists)DEMOCRATIC GLOBALISMDebt relief, reformed global institutions, democratic voice with core labor,environmental and human rights standards in trade agreements, newmarket access in the North to support strategic development in the South,expanded trade adjustment – Seattle coalitionKey U.S.-based proponents: Labor, environmental and campus activistgroups, insider critics (and unreformed academics who came of age in the1960s)Fighting the Global EconomyNationalism – protectionism, chauvinist rivalryLocalism – deep local roots, anarchismReligious fundamentalism – of many varietiesCommunism – in decline, failed vision of the past, China joins WTONeo-naziism – militia, Oklahoma City, anti-immigrant demagoguery3Thomas L. Friedman, “Evolutionaries,” New York Times, July 20, 2001, p. A21.96Lowell Turner: Labor and Global JusticeMarket globalismMarket globalism is the dominant force shaping today’s world economy.4 The emphasisis on free markets. Multinational corporations, backed by the rich country govern-ments in which they are based, are the primary economic and political actors shapingthis global order. We used to say “what’s good for GM is good for America” (or atleast that was what the widely quoted president of GM said). Now it’s more like“what’s good for capital is good for the global economy”: trickle-down economicswrit large. The World Trade Organization and the G-7 heads of states actively andcentrally promote the interests of business – in the belief that what is good for inter-national business is good for us all.In the context of existing global institutions and architecture, this model aims tomaximize opportunities for business by expanding free trade, deregulation, and capitalflows while minimizing business risk. Property rights and investment protections intrade agreements are important, but not labor or environmental standards that raisecosts and cut down on business discretion (and thus investment, jobs and generalprosperity in this trickle-down worldview). While the primary locus of economic andpolitical power lies in the global North, the governments and large businesses of manydeveloping countries are also party to the dominant global order. From “crony capital-ism” to labor-repressive domestic policies and acceptance of the IMF model, many(but not all) governments of the South help sustain market globalism while blockingdemocratic reform both at home and in the global economy.Contemporary negotiations at the G-7, WTO, IMF and World Bank aim todeepen market globalism as an engine of prosperity and development. Markets arepowerful instruments that can and often do promote an efficient allocation of re-sources and economic growth. But free markets typically also produce great inequali-ties and environmental “externalities.” Growing social and economic polarization inthe United States is one example; by contrast, inequality is tempered in Europe bystronger social policy (Hutton 2002). Most serious is the growing divide between richand poor countries, referred to by Bruce Scott (2001) as “the great divide in the globalvillage.” A widespread concern here is that even if we don’t care about the injustice ofinequality, we will quite simply never be safe from terrorists, revolutionaries and otheranti-system forces in a vastly unequal world (see also Kapstein 1996).Democratic globalismIn response to such concerns, democratic globalism has emerged in recent years as a pow-erful yet still largely unformed alternative vision and force.5 Most participants at theSeattle demonstrations would I believe fall under this heading. American labor unions,for example, have in many (but not all) cases moved beyond national protectionism to45Alternative labels could include free market globalism, liberal globalism, global neoliberalism, corpo-rate globalism or just plain global capitalism. Theoretical justification ranges from a softer so-cial-democratic version by Thomas Friedman (1999) to the hard-core market fundamen-talist perspectives of Milton Friedman (2002) and his followers.Authors range from insiders like Joseph Stiglitz (2002) and George Soros (2002) to deepercritics such as Will Hutton (2002), Charles Derber (2002) and Naomi Klein (2002).Industrielle Beziehungen, 11. Jg., Heft 1+2, 200497advocate basic labor and socials standards in trade agreements and to demand a seatfor labor at the WTO and other corporate-dominated bodies shaping global economicrelations. Environmental groups mobilizing for Seattle and subsequent efforts (includ-ing the annual World Social Forum in Porto Alegre and the 2002 Johannesburg EarthSummit) have moved beyond species or wilderness protection to build coalitions withlabor and community groups for sustainable jobs and earth-friendly development.Human rights groups, debt relief advocates, religious organizations, consumer groupsand many more have mobilized in new coalitions, local, national and global, to ad-vance human and environmental interests in a changing world economy.Among such a wide variety of international, national and local groupings, thereare to be sure substantially diverging interests. Some World Social Forum leaders arein fact more anti-globalist than reformist. Policy proposals in areas such as immigra-tion and debt relief are highly contested within reform circles. Conflicts among envi-ronmental and poverty activists are commonplace and chronic. Overcoming suchcontradictions is an ongoing challenge for today’s activist coalition builders, from thelocal level on up (Rose 2000).While such groups and coalitions are still emerging, still working out points ofunity and disagreement, there is a common thread: a growing call for voice, for de-mocratic input, for the concerns of workers, citizens and the environment to be heardin economic and political decision-making processes. The press typically labels theprotestors “anti-globalization.” Some of them are, including many of the most visibleand violent (the ones the press itself loves to glorify). Understanding that we live in anincreasingly global society, however, most of these activist groups aim to expand de-mocratic voice at all the levels where it is now essential: local, national, regional andglobal. The democratic globalist vision, in its developing essence, aims to preserve andexpand democratic voice where it now exists at national and local levels, and to build anew global social dimension so that globalization does not overwhelm local and na-tional democracy.Democratic globalism is not for the most part a revolutionary force. On the con-trary, it is overwhelmingly reformist, seeking to reform existing market globalism tomake it more democratic, more just and green. Just as the brutalities of early capital-ism called forth both reformist and revolutionary opposition, so the brutalities ofglobal capitalism call forth many types of opposition. In the rich countries at least, andto a large extent in developing countries as well, the dominant call of the opposition isnot for overthrow of the system but for inclusion. This could change if inclusion isdenied, as the powers-that-be are often warned – from the outside by vast demonstra-tions and from the inside by analysts such as Ethan Kapstein (1996), George Soros(2002) and Joseph Stiglitz (2002). A new focus at Nike and other companies on “cor-porate social responsibility” and codes of conduct as well as the World Bank’s newsensitivity to political realities in developing countries can all be understood as re-sponses to (and attempts to co-opt) mounting pressures for reform.66See for example Michael Skapinker, “Why Nike has broken into a sweat.” Financial Ti-mes, FT.com, March 6, 2002.98Lowell Turner: Labor and Global JusticeExclusion combined with deprivation can transform reformist into revolutionaryforces, creating a fertile seedbed for extraordinary evils such as ethnic cleansing andterrorism. In short, the alternatives to a reformist democratic globalism are not pretty.Forces of reactionForces opposing the global economy vary across a wide range of strategies and world-views. What they have in common, in addition to an opposition to globalization, is atendency to look backward in time. Earlier romantics looked to a state of nature or anidyllic medieval village – one that may never have existed but has been nicely recreatedfor mass consumption at today’s Renaissance Faire. Anti-globalizers look back to theglory and security of the nation-state, the vitality of the local community, the sanctityof religious purity or the certainty of past ideologies. While the visions may be com-pelling and may even attract mass followings, each is in fundamental ways impossiblydiscordant with the modern world.Nationalism puts the interests of the nation-state above all else. Historically, thisforce is associated with the nation-building of the 19th and 20th centuries and hasbrought many gains, from national defense and prosperity to the welfare state. On thedownside, nationalism produces intolerance, narrow-mindedness and war. In theglobal economy, nationalist sentiment can choke off world trade and global solutionsto common problems. A contemporary example of shortsighted nationalism lies in theAmerican decision in 2001 to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol, a far-reaching in-ternational agreement to reduce greenhouse emissions and global warming, on thegrounds that this might hurt the American economy.Localism offers a beautiful alternative vision based on the vitality, environmentand interpersonal connections of local place and community (Mander and Goldsmith1996). Again, however, the task is to integrate communities, along with regional andnational economies, in a constructive way within the broader world economy. Local-ism that takes the form of anti-government anarchism is a utopian dead-end – orworse when it takes shape as window-smashing black shirts at otherwise non-violentmass demonstrations.If Hitler and the Holocaust were products of a vile, extreme nationalism, the ter-rorist attacks of September 11 were products of an extreme and intolerant religious fun-damentalism. While most religious fundamentalists are non-violent and many withdrawto a large extent from the modern world, uncompromising religious belief can moti-vate all kinds of horrors. Historically, wars and massacres in the name of religion havebeen particularly bloody, and in our time the targets have ranged from doctors per-forming abortions to ethnic cleansing in the Balkans to the attack on innocent civil-ians at the World Trade Center. Religious fundamentalists look backward in time toearly religious communities and saviors and forward in time to some promised landbeyond the earth. Squeezed between these idealized points of reference, an increas-ingly global society, especially a commercial, secular one, appears alien and oftenthreatening to core fundamentalist values.Communism offered an alternative global vision, one that failed long before thecollapse of the Soviet Union. Today’s communists, in places such as China and Cuba(along with significant reformed communist – now largely social-democratic – unionsIndustrielle Beziehungen, 11. Jg., Heft 1+2, 200499and parties throughout eastern and western Europe), hardly offer much threat to thenew global order. China, the one large bastion where a communist government rules,has largely abandoned any kind of Marxist economic vision in favor of the dynamismof markets – with great economic success – and has now joined the WTO.Neo-naziism is an extreme one-dimensional form of nationalism, based on racial orethnic superiority. This is also largely a failed vision of the past, with ugly present ech-oes in “skinhead” attacks on foreign workers in Germany, in anti-immigrant propa-ganda in France and many other societies, and in outrages like the Oklahoma City fed-eral building bombing. With little mass following anywhere, thoroughly discredited inthe wake of World War II, such ideologies have only minimal bearing on global de-bates yet continue to persist as dangerous, backward looking fringe forces in modernsocieties.None of the five forces fighting the global economy offer realistic solutions tocontemporary problems. All look backward in time rather than forward. While com-munism and neo-naziism offer only failed and seriously flawed visions of the past, na-tionalism and localism each offer one important building block as long as neither isreified into the sole solution. Where religious fundamentalism is non-violent, it offersa test of the capacity of modern secular societies for wide-ranging religious toleranceand freedom. A broadly acceptable global vision will surely exclude neo-naziism andterrorism while accepting reformed communism and religious freedom and buildingupon local vitality and the still important nation-state.Forces for reform: Labor, environmental and campus activismAt the dawning of a new millennium, perhaps anything is possible. How many of usdreamed in our darkest nights of passenger planes exploding into mammoth high-risebuildings? The unspeakable proved all too possible.Yet there were also signs of wonder and hope at the turning of the millennium.On November 30, 1999, sea turtles rose up on two legs and marched through thestreets of Seattle. They challenged the World Trade Organization and joined withworkers and students to protest corporate dominance of the global economy. To-gether they planted seeds of democratic globalism. The emerging vision persists, nowoffering a way beyond the horrors of September 11 and the injustice of growing ine-quality and massive corporate corruption.What American actors can promote and advocate the deepening of democracy atlocal, national and global levels? As always in such periods, multiple movements arepresent, feeding off each other, overlapping, in conflict and in coalition. As unionsmove toward new tactics of rank-and-file mobilization and broad coalition building,the labor movement is a central presence in the current upsurge, and indeed the core is-sue is economic and social polarization – in both American and global society. The en-vironmental movement, building on three decades of progress, swells in fits and starts asthe earth’s limits become increasingly clear and as former opponents such as unionscome around. “Blue-green” (labor-environmental) alliances spread, from college cam-puses where green and sweatshop activists intermingle to local coalitions for sustain-able jobs and national campaigns against fast track and the Free Trade Area of theAmericas. After decades of quiescence, campus activism is on the rise, around labor, en-100Lowell Turner: Labor and Global Justicevironmental and a variety of other issues. In addition, human rights, civil rights, thewomen’s movement, consumer protection, international solidarity, the peace and debtrelief movements, community organizing around local issues – all play a role in today’sresurgent progressive coalitions. And building on all of these is the more recent andpotentially massive antiwar movement (led by groups such as MoveOn.org, ANSWER,ATTAC, and USLAW – U.S. Labor against the War).There is also a blending of generations in these campaigns for reform and ex-panded democracy. Many of today’s labor, environmental and antiwar leaders arethemselves former activists of the sixties. Idealistic, informed by lifelong social values,they are now highly skilled organizers and competent administrators as well. Yet thedriving energy comes from a new generation, in their late teens and twenties, campus,community and workplace activists, coming of age in a churning social environmentthat kindles activist passion. From Students Against Sweatshops to “union kids” onthe front lines of organizing drives, from green-haired sea turtles in Seattle to high-school demonstrators against war in Iraq, the next generation of activists has arrived.When social movements subside (as they always do), they leave behind networksand communities of activists who defend the gains and carry on the campaigns, espe-cially at the grassroots level. This is a phenomenon well known to social movementtheorists, and this is exactly what happened in the 1970s and 1980s (Staggenborg1998; Tarrow 1994). In the absence of powerful social forces on their side – quite thecontrary in the Reagan era – veteran activists from the 1960s did more than bide theirtime. Some spread environmental consciousness and green politics (with a perfecttarget in the environmental policies of Interior Secretary James Watt), while othersdeveloped through experimentation labor’s new “organizing model.” They havefought through the system into positions of leadership and responsibility. Most im-portantly, they have kept the flame burning for a new activist generation.The evidence: Coalition buildingThis paper is intended more as a provocative research design than as the presentationof a fully formed argument. The resurgence of labor, environmental and campus activ-ism is demonstrated here in case studies of coalition building that together indicate thegrowing salience of contemporary reform movements. While labor is at the center ofthis analysis, environmental, campus, antiwar and other movements – and especiallythe growing linkages among them – are as essential for the prospects of national andglobal reform.After 40 years of declining business unionism, the American labor movement an-nounced at least the possibility of revitalization in its impressive coalition-building ef-forts for the Seattle demonstrations of 1999. Campaigns with environmentalists inbattles against NAFTA (1993) and fast track (1997-98) inspired a broad Alliance forSustainable Jobs and the Environment (Shoch 2001; Rose 2000), that itself laid thegroundwork for the demonstrations in Seattle against the policies of the WTO. Em-powered by the broad nature of this global justice coalition, activists fanned out intogrowing and often successful local coalition efforts aimed at a broad range of issues,from living wage and anti-sweatshop to peace and sustainable economic development.Industrielle Beziehungen, 11. Jg., Heft 1+2, 2004101The building of active coalitions – most of them at the local level – has been acentral component of the revitalization of the American labor movement since theearly 1990s. The Seattle coalition, which brought together 30,000 demonstrators or-ganized by labor groups with 20,000 from environmental, religious, human rights andother groups to protest World Trade Organization policies, was only the most dra-matic manifestation of the growing coalition phenomenon (Hawken 2000). Since theplant-closing coalitions of the 1980s, accelerating since the mid-1990s, key unions ha-ve moved beyond traditional bases, in some cases to build enduring alliances withhuman rights, environmental, religious, student, feminist, and other communitygroups. In response (and perhaps wisely from a political perspective), the Bush ad-ministration has attempted to break apart such coalitions, signing up several unions,for example, to support the campaign for Arctic oil drilling. The continuing revitaliza-tion of the American labor movement may well depend on the success or failure oflabor in redefining itself as a broad partisan force, in lasting national and local coali-tions with a broad range of social groups.As part of a broader picture of revitalization, coalitions have increased in impor-tance for particular activist unions, especially for those with a strong commitment toorganizing (including, for example, SEIU, HERE, CWA and UNITE). Labor-backedcoalitions cover a wide variety of local concerns, in addition to national alliances withenvironmental (and other) groups around issues such as fair trade (Rose 2000). At thesame time, the environmental movement has developed an increasingly significant“environmental justice” dimension, opening the door to expanded social coalitions(Shabecoff 2000). And a new generation of student activists has built reform coali-tions extending across campus, into the community and even into national and globalpolitics.The paradox for advocates of democratic globalism is that most of these coalitionefforts are local. Building on local groups, issues and leaders, such coalitions nonethe-less reflect the economic and social realities of a global economy. Local activists, to besure, may not “think globally” at all, even as their campaigns serve as carriers of abroader reform vision.7 But just as local coalitions laid the groundwork for the mas-sive Seattle demonstrations, such groupings increasingly and inevitably are drawn intoglobal issues and debates – from immigration and corporate accountability to invest-ment, skills training and tax policy. And some of the most promising coalition-building cases take place in so-called “global cities,” where concentrations of globalcapital collide with growing low-end service (and often largely immigrant) workforces(Sassen 1998).American unions are still far less global in orientation than they need to be. Whileinternational solidarity networks are expanding (Gordon and Turner 2000; Nissen2002), the major contribution of American unions and other interest groups and socialmovements to democratic globalism remains at the local and national levels, pushingfrom within the superpower for economic, social and environmental policy reform.7See, for example, Herod 2001; and Reynolds 2002.102Lowell Turner: Labor and Global JusticeCoalition case studiesWhile most national unions (led by the AFL-CIO) sat out the social movements of the1960s, local unions here and there, in cities such as San Francisco, Seattle and NewYork, did participate in antiwar and civil rights coalitions (Turner 2003). As thosemovements declined in the 1970s, labor’s limited participation also declined; and notcoincidentally labor’s isolation deepened and membership density dropped in the faceof growing employer opposition. In response to deep recession and plant closings inthe 1980s, labor-community coalitions finally emerged in defensive campaigns to savefactories and jobs (Brecher and Costello 1990). On that foundation, a new wave of la-bor-backed coalition efforts, some strategic and enduring, emerged in the 1990s acrossa range of issues. Of particular recent interest are the following examples of strategiccoalition building, presented here as partial findings from ongoing research.8Journalist Robert Kuttner has described the living wage movement as “the most in-teresting (and under-reported) grassroots enterprise to emerge since the civil rightsmovement” (quoted in Pollin and Luce 1998, p.1). In cities large and small across thecountry, coalitions of activists, often labor-led, campaign for local minimum wages (atleast for government-contracted or subsidized work) considerably higher than the na-tional minimum wage, with notable cases of success. Examples include the Commu-nity Labor Alliance in Connecticut (with living wage laws passed in New Haven in1997 and Hartford in 1999), the Santa Clara County Central Labor Council in alliancewith Working Partnerships USA and sixty groups (pushing the San Jose City Councilto adopt living wage policies in 1998; Brownstein 2000), and the Los Angeles LivingWage Coalition (with broad popular and deep political support resulting in victory in2000). In most cases, successful coalitions are led by local unions with active nationalunion support, with networks of overlapping activists in long-term regularized rela-tionships among a variety of community-based groups, including social movements,churches and political organizations. Broad success for the living wage movement isindicated in the spread of new legislation: over 70 American cities had passed livingwage laws by 2002 (Luce 2002; Reynolds and Kern 2001).The anti-sweatshop movement of the late 1990s and beyond offers another exampleof successful coalition building, in this case for campus-based local movements origi-nally inspired (but no longer led) by organized labor.9 UNITE has from the start beenthe key union involved. Chapters of Students Against Sweatshops (180 of them later89Findings are based on an extensive collection of coalition case studies gathered over thepast three years. Research has been supported by grants from the Ford Foundation andCornell University, with conference support from the ILO, Friedrich Ebert Stiftung andHans-Böckler-Stiftung. Graduate student research assistants who have conducted casestudies and helped develop the analysis include Ian Greer, Nathan Lillie, Julie Sadler andSarah Swider. Earlier versions of the living wage and Justice for Janitors cases appear inHurd, Milkman and Turner 2003.See, for example Steven Greenhouse, “Students Urge Colleges to Join a New Anti-Sweatshop Group,” New York Times, October 20, 1999; Victoria Griffith, “Anti-Sweatshop Campaign to be Launched,” Financial Times, October 19, 1999; and the website usasweb.org.Industrielle Beziehungen, 11. Jg., Heft 1+2, 2004103brought together in 1999 in the umbrella United Students Against Sweatshops) tookhold on American campuses after the first Union Summer in 1996. A project of thenew Sweeney-led AFL-CIO, Union Summer placed hundreds of young people insummer internships in organizing and collective bargaining campaigns, encouragingthem to build centers of labor activism on their return to the workplace or collegecampus. Inspired by these returning activists, the anti-sweatshop movement grew rap-idly and dramatically, with successful sit-ins at universities as diverse as Duke, Brown,Michigan, Wisconsin, Penn, Arizona, Georgetown and North Carolina. While UNITEand Union Summer helped to launch the movement and UNITE has underwritten thecosts of USAS national meetings, case study interviews indicate that campus-basedcoalitions are significantly autonomous. Supporting each other when possible, work-ing together loosely in USAS, activists have built distinct local coalitions with a varietyof campus, religious, community groups and local unions. Critical components of suc-cess in the growth and development of the campus anti-sweatshop movement appearto include: national union support (especially at the beginning, for resources and edu-cation, and for continuing USAS conference funding); the building of lasting local or-ganizations (SAS and related coalitions); and the capacity to mobilize thousands ofstudents for demonstrations, sit-ins and other activities.In some ways the most problematic yet at the same time most promising coali-tions are sustainability alliances, with labor and environmental groups at the core (Mo-berg 1999; Rose 2000). When these two groups – often adversaries in the past – worktogether, the potential for both national political influence and local mobilization isgreat. Recent research shows that in spite of stereotypes, relations between labor andenvironmental groups are on the whole quite positive (Obach 1999). Today there arescores of such coalitions working together on a wide variety of issues, from livingwage and anti-sweatshop campaigns to toxic waste sites, workplace health and safety,clean air and global warming. A recent potentially path-breaking example is the ApolloProject, advocating a 10-year $300 billion research plan to promote hybrid and hydro-gen cars and clean energy factories and appliances, thereby promoting manufacturingand construction jobs in the U.S. and at the same time fighting environmental pollu-tion – in a coalition effort backed by key unions (UAW, USW, IAM, UMW, IBEW,SEIU) as well as environmental groups such as the Sierra Club.10While local coalitions predominate and are generally quite autonomous, they typi-cally receive important support from national labor and environmental organizationsand sometimes as well from national umbrella groupings such as the Alliance for Sus-tainable Jobs and the Environment. The Alliance formed in the losing fight againstNAFTA in 1993, regrouped to defeat fast-track legislation in 1997 (Shoch 2001), andprovided the framework within which the Seattle demonstrations were organized inthe fall of 1999. Active members at the national level range from Steelworkers andCarpenters to Friends of the Earth and the Sierra Club. While recent tensions over10Steven Greenhouse, “Unions Back Research Plan for Energy,” New York Times, June 6,2003, p. A20. (UAW is the United Auto Workers, USW the United Steel Workers, IAMthe International Association of Machinists, IBEW the International Brotherhood ofElectrical Workers, and SEIU the Service Employees International Union.)104Lowell Turner: Labor and Global Justiceglobal warming policies, oil drilling in Alaska, and automobile mileage requirementshave made collaboration more problematic, over 200 member groups remain commit-ted to fighting anti-labor and anti-environmental legislation at national and local levels.Local coalition efforts continue to thrive in dozens of cities and regions.Observing that labor-environmental coalitions are often “cross-class alliances,”Fred Rose emphasizes the role of bridge builders – those who have been upwardly ordownwardly mobile or have social movement histories that push them across the di-vide (Rose 2000).11 Also typically present in the building of labor-environmental coali-tions are strong support from national organizations, overlapping networks of activistsin the different organizations, and an ongoing history of common effort leading toprocesses of alliance institutionalization.Closely related to living wage and anti-sweatshop campaigns are union-initiatedcoalitions conceived in support of labor campaigns that develop long-term strategicpotential. One example is SEIU’s Justice for Janitors, essentially a national effort to reor-ganize urban building services after a period of de-unionization. Faced with the loss ofmembers as building owners eliminated jobs and turned to janitorial service contrac-tors in the 1980s, SEIU developed a combined organizing, bargaining and civil rightsstrategy based on the corporate campaign model with special attention to buildingcoalitions in specific communities. This has been a national effort based on the mobi-lization of local union activists in coalition with local churches, community organiza-tions, and labor-friendly elected officials. In some cities the coalitions have been tem-porary or sporadic, but in other cities they have endured. Perhaps the best example isLos Angeles where thousands of largely Hispanic janitors have been organized andwon major contract improvements in a series of successive campaigns from the early1990s through a dramatic strike victory in 2000, each campaign building a broader anddeeper level of community support (Erickson et. al. 2001; Milkman and Wong 2001).12In spite of these promising examples, the reality is that most American unionscontinue to think about coalitions in more narrow, defensive terms. This is true evenwhere unions have relied on comprehensive campaigns as a source of leverage duringcontract negotiations and organizing drives. Outreach to potential allies for support inpressuring employers tends to be on union terms, and typically dissolves when thecampaign ends. Although such outreach may help in the effort to reconstruct labor asa broad partisan force, sustainable momentum requires more lasting relationships.Increasingly indispensable for organizing, political action and international soli-darity, coalition building is critical to the current revitalization of the American labormovement. Moving beyond the “special interest group” mentality of business uniontraditions, coalition-building unions seek to broaden community bases while expand-ing political influence.1112Note the parallel here to the finding by Kim Voss and Rachel Sherman (2000) that localunions shifting focus toward external organizing require activists with experience in othercommunity or social movements.And Los Angeles is a good example of the “global city” – a critical arena for labor mo-vement revitalization – where great concentrations of corporate wealth depend on newinflows of low-paid migrant and immigrant labor (Sassen 1998).Industrielle Beziehungen, 11. Jg., Heft 1+2, 2004105The argument summarizedFor the cases presented above and many more, progressive coalitions including laborhave developed and deepened across the United States over the past decade. In citiessuch as Los Angeles, the result has been the wholesale transformation of local poli-tics.13 Coalition case studies offer preliminary but important evidence pointing towardkey causal factors at work in the emergence of contemporary forces for political, eco-nomic and social reform.Expanded coalition building among revitalized activist groups appears to be a drivingforce and necessary condition for the growing significance of reform forces and theirbudding alternative vision (itself local and national as well as global). While the othertwo necessary conditions, inequality and strategic leadership, cannot be fully devel-oped here, their importance is demonstrated in processes of labor-led coalition build-ing, presented above and summarized as follows.Growing inequality is clearly an important underlying economic condition pushinglabor toward coalitions such as living wage, anti-sweatshop and Justice for Janitors.Economic and social polarization, seen for example in the decay of inner cities, hasalso inspired the emergence within the environmental movement of a new focus onenvironmental justice, opening the possibility of broadened coalition efforts with la-bor, human rights, religious and community groups. And contemporary campus is-sues, from USAS to solidarity with university workers and their collective bargainingcampaigns, are in many cases driven by a passionate outrage at the massive inequalitiesof global, national and local economies. Corporate corruption scandals have onlymagnified the awareness and readiness for protest action, especially of an increasinglyactivist young generation.Strategic leadership appears to be the third necessary condition for the growing sig-nificance of contemporary reform forces. Most obviously, the election of an insurgentslate at the AFL-CIO in 1995 has expanded the strategic vision of a considerable“vanguard” (if still a minority) of American unions, shifting emphasis toward organiz-ing and rank-and-file mobilization and encouraging progressive coalition building(Bronfenbrenner et al. 1998; Turner, Katz and Hurd 2001). In a parallel development,the movement for environmental justice has transformed the thinking of key envi-ronmental leaders, moving the focus beyond wilderness preservation to urban revitali-zation and sustainable development coalitions (Rose 2000; Shabecoff 2000). OnAmerican college campuses, a new generation of activist leadership has emerged, withan expansive view of coalition building and reform possibilities.14 Strategic leadership1314This is particularly striking for a native Angeleno returning to visit. The Los Angeles Igrew up in was largely Republican and non-union. L.A. today has a plausible claim as oneof the country’s strongest union towns, and the latest mayoral runoff election (2001) wasbetween two pro-labor Democrats. The transformation has been driven by the expansionof the Hispanic community and its political and economic mobilization, along with thecoalition building of a revitalized local labor movement (Milkman 2002).The most visible national manifestation of new strategic campus leadership has been thefounding of United Students Against Sweatshops, referred to by one student activist in-106Lowell Turner: Labor and Global Justiceappears to be important both at high levels of organizations – John Sweeney andDavid Brower, for example, each played key roles in bringing together the Alliance forSustainable Jobs and the Environment and the subsequent Seattle coalition – and atlocal levels, where bridge builders with cross-movement experiences or perspectivesare especially important.15In addition to coalition building, inequality and strategic leadership, two morefactors appear to matter in explaining the growing strength of reform forces. One isthe political opportunity structure. Clearly, corporate scandals open the door for reform ef-forts. Yet the breadth of successful living wage and anti-sweatshop campaigns in agreat variety of American cities and universities (pre-dating the corporate corruptionepidemic of 2002) suggests that other factors – strategic leadership, coalition building,chronic inequality – may be more important, something for future research to con-sider. The other significant factor is grassroots mobilization, present to a significant extentin all of our successful coalition campaign cases. How and why such mobilization, par-ticipatory politics at its best, becomes possible is also a question for future research. Ismobilization a causal factor in itself, making everything else possible, or is mobiliza-tion a sort of “natural force” that occurs spontaneously when the door is opened (andwhen other factors such as inequality, strategic leadership and coalition building are inplace)?The literature reconsideredFindings presented here challenge various perspectives in comparative industrial rela-tions, political economy and sociology. This can be illustrated through a focus on con-trasting analyses of labor.Postwar industrial relations analysis in the U.S. operated within a dominantAmerican-centered, pluralist perspective, assuming a stable social system and wellfunctioning sub-systems such as industrial relations, with a focus on institutions andthe details and effects of policies such as collective bargaining (Dunlop, 1958;Dahrendorf 1959; Kerr, Dunlop, Harbison and Myers 1960; Slichter, Livermore andNash 1960). The mutual recognition of the two major actors, business and labor, en-sured stability of the industrial relations system. According to this perspective, mutualrecognition was itself the consequence of the withering away of class conflict acrossthe advanced world and its substitution with the joint search for technocratic solu-tions to the problems of industrialism (Dunlop, 1958; Kerr, Dunlop, Harbirson andMyers, 1960).This perspective reflected postwar growth and stability through the mid-1960s, aswell as the cold war dominance of the American mass production economy. Consis-15terviewed for this research as his generation’s Port Huron (the founding of Students for aDemocratic Society in 1962).Examples include Miguel Contreras, head of the L.A. County Federation of Labor, whoearlier worked with Cesar Chavez in the social movement-oriented United Farm Workers;and Ron Judd, who helped develop the Seattle blue-green alliance prior to 1999, as headof the King County Central Labor Council (and is now Director of the Western Regionfor the AFL-CIO).Industrielle Beziehungen, 11. Jg., Heft 1+2, 2004107tent with apparently stable business unionism, this literature was challenged from acomparative perspective in the 1970s and 1980s by a new European-based literatureon democratic corporatism (Schmitter and Lehmbruch 1979; Berger, 1981;Lehmbruch and Schmitter, 1982; Goldthorpe 1984). While the new literature broad-ened the scope of analysis, moving labor and business out of the sub-system and intomore central positions in the political economy in line with their place in most westernEuropean societies, the focus remained on institutions and policies. Each of thesecontending perspectives, pluralism and corporatism, served as precursors for the newinstitutionalism of the 1980s and 1990s (Hall 1986; March and Olsen 1989; Steinmo,Thelen and Longstreth 1992).In the meantime, social and economic stability in North America and westernEurope came undone with the war in Vietnam and the social movements of the 1960sand early 1970s. A new literature appeared, seeking to understand and explain the riseand fall of social movements. Although the late 1960s and early 1970s were marked bystrike waves (legal and wildcat) across western Europe and North America, the socialmovement literature focused largely on movements such as civil rights, anti-war,women’s and environmental. While a few studies brought labor and social movementstogether in a limited way (Crouch and Pizzorno 1978; Sabel 1982), analytical currentsmoved significantly apart. While labor was viewed for the most part as an establishedforce with institutional support (and perhaps thus even part of the problem ratherthan the solution), social movements were seen as fresh, insurgent, and fighting forspace within the political economy and society (Offe, 1985; Habermas, 1989).In other words, just as American labor largely failed to ride the social movementwave of the 1960s (Turner 2003), so too did the literatures on industrial relations andpolitical economy fail to incorporate the insights of a rich, new social movement lit-erature. And with the decline of the social movements of the 1960s, the narrow focuspersisted. By the 1980s, however, it was impossible to ignore the increasing effects ofglobal economic pressure as well as the newly aggressive posture on the part of manyfirms and states.While the literature on corporatism challenged American pluralist thought from acomparative perspective (e.g., labor plays a very different role in different societies),the next wave of American literature accepted pluralist assumptions but challengedconventional industrial relations views based on sub-system stability (Kochan, Katzand McKersie 1986). In a context of economic crisis in the 1970s and 1980s, this newperspective emphasized the strategic choice of employers in the U.S., who increasinglyopposed unions and undermined traditional collective bargaining arrangements intheir response to competitive world markets (Piore and Sabel 1984). Dynamic marketsand employer opposition (often backed by government policy) resulted in serious andaccelerating union decline in the U.S., destabilizing and in some cases marginalizingthe traditional industrial relations sub-system while offering little hope for unions be-yond concession bargaining and the acceptance of new employer-led flexibility and la-bor-management cooperation. Labor’s decline in the U.S. and U.K. together with thehegemony of Reagan/Thatcher free-market policies would have far reaching effectson unions and workforces everywhere in an increasingly global economy.108Lowell Turner: Labor and Global JusticeWhile the labor literature of the 1990s was dominated by strategic choice on theone hand and institutionalism on the other, a new mobilization perspective emergedhand-in-hand with the revitalization of labor movements, especially in the U.S. andU.K. (Johnston 1994; Bronfenbrenner et al. 1998; Hurd 1998; Heery 1998; Kelly 1998;Milkman and Wong 2001; Turner, Katz and Hurd 2001). In contrast to earlier litera-ture, revitalization research emphasized the key role of union strategies, of unions andworkers as actors with choices that matter. Early postwar theorists (industrial relationsscholars, political scientists, sociologists) had seen unions as integrated, stable partiesto enduring bargaining arrangements, with rank-and-file participation largely unneces-sary (except in political elections and every once in a great while in the event of astrike). Workforce demobilization was an assumption common to theorists of Ameri-can business unionism and European corporatism alike. Kochan, Katz and McKersie,by contrast, reflected the break-up of postwar stability and viewed unions to a largeextent as victims of global markets, employer opposition and state policy. While un-ions did have choices, none were very promising, with options limited by employer at-titudes and competitive markets: cooperation and limited participation seemed tosome the best route but offered little hope for turning around the protracted declineof the American labor movement (cf. Kochan 1995; Kochan and Osterman, 1994).The new institutionalism also emphasized unions, employers and government asactors integrated into a more or less stable framework of laws, organizations and regu-larized relationships. With behavior shaped by institutional and political constraints,however, labor was largely marginalized in the U.S. and U.K. in the 1980s and early1990s, with little hope for any fundamental change.16 In all of these earlier perspec-tives, whether unions were nicely integrated or unfortunate victims, there was littleroom for labor as a movement, for coalition building, for expanded rank-and-file ac-tivism, for activist leadership committed to reform, for an expansion of democracy inthe workplace and beyond.The latest wave of labor scholarship, by contrast, examines the potential for un-ions to serve as pro-active organizers, system builders, grappling with and shaping thechallenges they face, to a large extent through coalition building and the mobilizationof participation (Bronfenbrenner et al. 1998; Kelly 1998; Turner, Katz and Hurd2001). This latest literature thus brings together insights from the long neglected (orpigeon-holed) social movement literature with strategic choice from industrial rela-tions and the new or historical institutionalism from comparative political economy.Strategic choice and institutional literatures offered important breakthroughs, inparticular regarding concepts such as actor choice, strategic alternatives, transforma-tion, and the powerful shaping influence of existing institutions. But both perspectivesare also flawed. None of their conceptual frameworks, for example, could have pre-dicted the AFL-CIO turn toward organizing, coalition building, and local mobilization16See, for example, Thelen 2001. The most recent incarnation of the comparative institu-tional perspective, to which Thelen’s work contributes, is the “varieties of capitalism” lit-erature (Hall and Soskice 2001). In this view, labor is for the most part either nicely inte-grated in the “coordinated market economies” or hopelessly marginalized in the “liberalmarket economies.”Industrielle Beziehungen, 11. Jg., Heft 1+2, 2004109and the very real possibility of labor movement revitalization. Both postwar industrialrelations and new institutional perspectives favor system stability, taking institutionsand bargaining arrangements as given. Strategic choice with its focus on transforma-tion is more dynamic, reflecting changing world markets and power relations; yet theemphasis is still on shoring up collective bargaining and shifting toward labor-management cooperation. Current revitalization literature, by contrast, seeks to inte-grate institutions, global markets and debates, coalition building and rank-and-file mo-bilization into a comprehensive actor-based framework, with a focus on describingand explaining contemporary activism, its presence or absence, successes and failures,effects both narrow and broad.Rejuvenated labor, environmental and campus movements in the U.S., as indi-cated in living-wage, anti-sweatshop, sustainable development and Justice for Janitorscampaigns (and much more), offer surprising evidence for the resurgence of progres-sive activism in America, at a critical historical juncture in which contrasting global vi-sions are just beginning to contend for prominence.Concluding remarksThere is no reason to believe that the global economy cannot be constructively re-formed in a contemporary, coalition-led push toward democratic globalism. To besure, the barriers are high, but new possibilities are also present. While we can onlyspeculate at this point about the institutions and policies that would predominate in ademocratic globalist world (and the typical safe academic approach by contrast is togive all the reasons why the current one-sided and corrupt market globalism will con-tinue to dominate), we can point to some of the essential social forces coalescingaround reform efforts. Here in the world’s only remaining superpower, revitalized la-bor, environmental and campus groups have been critical actors in promoting reformaimed at local, national and global conditions. Predominantly local, such coalitions,taken together across the United States, amount to a substantial movement for broadeconomic and social policy reform, an American movement with potentially globalramifications.The argument presented here first contends that this revitalization of social forcesin the U.S. is significant enough to need explanation, and, second, presents evidencepointing toward key causal forces at work: chronic inequality, strategic leadership, andmost importantly coalition building. Because inequality is increasingly highlighted incontemporary corporate scandals, because labor, environmental and campus move-ments now offer strategic leadership with a greatly expanded perspective, and becausecoalition building among these and other groups is rampant across a range of issues,especially at the local level but increasingly at national and global levels as well, there isreason to hope for the expansion of substantial ongoing reform efforts, right here inthe so-called “belly of the beast.”ReferencesBerger, Suzanne (ed.)
