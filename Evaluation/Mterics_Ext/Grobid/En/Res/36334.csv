For most sociologists the func-tioning of markets is closely connected to the moral conduct of economic actors. Thisposition is expressed, for instance, by the French sociologist Émile Durkheim (1984)who argued that purely self-interested behavior cannot produce stable exchange rela-tions. Only through the “non contractual conditions of contract” do actors feel effec-tively bound to the contractual obligations they have agreed to. The moral code stopsactors from exploiting their exchange partners through opportunistic behavior. Thisway morality supports the functioning of markets by reducing transaction costs. An-other sociological classic, Max Weber (1984), made morality a cornerstone in his ex-planation of macroeconomic development: For him the emergence of modern west-ern capitalism had an indispensable basis in the moral doctrines of Protestantism.Wolfgang Streeck (1997: 198) followed this idea by introducing the notion of “benefi-cial constraints,” meaning that the performance of an economy “may be improved bythe surrounding society retaining and exercising a right for itself to interfere with thechoice and pursuit of individual preferences.”However, the conviction that markets need a moral basis has not gone undisputed insociology (Luhmann 1986, 1988). But more than sociologists, economists have chal-lenged this position. Most famously the model of the “invisible hand” expresses theconnection of public virtue to private vices and thereby disconnects market outcomesfrom morally motivated action.It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our din-ner but from their regard to their self-interest. (Smith 1976: 18)1A famous contemporary expression of the unwanted consequences of morally moti-vated behavior in markets is Milton Friedman’s (1973) dictum that “the social re-sponsibility of business is to make profits.” According to Friedman, any deviationfrom profit maximization is itself morally problematic since the moral task of eco-nomic actors is to maximize economic welfare.While economists standing in the neo-classical tradition see moral action orientationsas blocking economically efficient outcomes, economists from other theoretical tradi-tions presume that the logic of self-interest must be moderated by morality in order toallow for the “common good” or even for the functioning of markets itself. The insti-tutionalist tradition, and also the new microeconomics, see norms, values and trust as1This reading of Adam Smith reflects the interpretation of his work by proponents of the neo-classical tradition in economics. Smith scholars have argued pervasively that this is a flawedinterpretation of the Scottish enlightenment philosopher (Wight: 2002). The purpose here,however, is to present an analytical position that plays an important role in economic think-ing.6MPIfG Discussion Paper 05 / 6indispensable elements of the functioning of markets (Arrow 1973). There are situa-tions where selfishness should be held back by moral principles to achieve superioroutcomes. The reason is that markets themselves are “morally unreliable” (Offe 1989).Morality is certainly not the only mechanism by which market failure can be cor-rected. Morality does play, however, an important role for overcoming free-riding andfor solving principal-agent problems.These brief remarks give an impression on the essentially contested role of moralityfor market outcomes. The conflict is not one that separates academic disciplines; itruns through disciplinary lines. My intention in this paper is to critically examinethese positions: Does morality hinder economic efficiency or is morality a necessarycondition for markets to operate? Which problems exactly can be resolved throughmorally motivated behavior? And which limitations to economic efficiency are causedby morality?2The question of the effects of morality on markets is not only of academic interest. Itis also from the background of recent corporate scandals that morality in business –or the lack thereof – has become a pressing issue in public debate. Have corporatemanagers become more selfish? What institutional or moral safeguards are needed toprevent the excesses that brought companies like Enron and Worldcom to bank-ruptcy?What I will argue in this paper is that the contested role of morality has its causes inthe indeed profoundly ambivalent consequences that morality has on market out-comes. Morality allows for the emergence and stabilization of market exchange, but itis also an action orientation that can block exchange relations that are economicallybeneficial. I intend to contribute to a better understanding of this ambivalence byintroducing a taxonomy that distinguishes four different forms of morality-based2In focusing on the economic effects of morality on market outcomes, I will not deal with threeother questions related to morality in the economy. First, I will not discuss the question of theconsequences for economic theory that derive from the inclusion of morality. Amartya Sen(1977), among others, has shown that morally motivated behavior demands profoundchanges of neoclassic economic models since it involves “in a very real sense, counterpreferen-tial choice, destroying the crucial assumption that a chosen alternative must be better than (orat least as good as) the others for the person choosing it” (Sen 1977: 33). The notion of meta-preferences is one well known suggestion to include morality into economic theory (Sen 1977;Hirschman 1986; Etzioni 1988). Secondly, I will deal only marginally with the question ofnon-economic justifications for “moral systems of exchange” (Biggart / Delbridge 2004). Eco-nomic efficiency cannot provide by itself justification for certain behaviors or institutionalregulations. To submerge normative questions under the logic of efficiency would be a cate-gorical mistake. A third question connected to the issue of morality and markets that is notdealt with here refers to the relationship of morality and institutions. What institutional sup-port do actors need in order to make it more likely that they will actually act in accordancewith the moral convictions they hold (Hirschman 1986; Offe 1989)?Beckert: The Moral Embeddedness of Markets7behavior and try to understand what consequences derive from these types of morallymotivated action. The four forms I will discuss I call “cooperation,” “group solidar-ity,” “blocked exchange” and “altruism.” There is a fifth – parasitic – type that I willcall “Trojan altruism.”By morality I mean that actors act in accordance with some principle which is ori-ented (also) toward the well-being of others or the common good and is followedeven if it demands to forgo additional personal profit or utility. Amartya Sen (1977)has called this action orientation “commitment.” With reference to the terminologyintroduced by Robert Frank (1990), one can formulate: to act morally, an actor mustbe willing to engage in “irrational behavior without regret.” “Irrational behavior” re-fers to decisions that deviate from individual utility maximization. The “lack of re-gret” implies that the behavior was chosen not simply by miscalculation of outcomesbut by a deliberate choice.My argument is not that the observation of inefficiencies due to moral orientations ofactors gives justifications to change these expressions of value rationality. Instead theargument is that economies operate within the context of a moral universe that resiststhe logic of economic efficiency and that at times this resistance is itself a preconditionfor market exchange, while at others it produces inefficiencies.A typology of moral behavior in market exchangeMorality can enter into market exchange in four different forms. It can enter by takingone’s own well-being and the well-being of others into consideration. This I will call“cooperation.” An important special case of cooperation will be discussed under theheading of “group solidarity.” The third typological form in which morality can enterinto market exchange is by an action orientation that is entirely non-consequentialist,i.e. which disregards the welfare effects for ego and alter-ego. This comes closest toWeber’s (1985) notion of value rationality. I will refer to this as “blocked exchange”(Walzer 1983). Morality can also enter the decision-making process in the typologicalform of ignoring consequences for one’s own well-being but having the well-being ofothers in mind. This I will call “altruism.” Finally, the last form is a parasitic way formorality to enter a decision-making situation. It indicates an action that appears to bebeneficial to others but is in fact primarily advantageous to the actor himself. Thisbehavior, which is actually immoral, I will call “Trojan altruism.”MPIfG Discussion Paper 05 / 6Table 1Typology of moral action in market exchangeEgoNon-beneficialBeneficialNon-beneficialBlocked exchanges(Trojan altruism)Alter egoGroupsolidarityBeneficialAltruismCooperation834CooperationBy cooperation I refer to a set of reciprocal promises and expectations that guide ex-change relationships in a mutually beneficial way. Such promises and expectations canbecome effective through an intersubjectively shared moral code that binds the behav-ior of the parties to the exchange. Based on this moral code, market participants willfulfill their contractual obligations even if it would be advantageous for them not todo so. They will also disclose relevant information accurately.3 Morality in “coopera-tion” can contribute to the solution of prisoner-dilemma situations and principal-agent problems.4 In the prisoner dilemma, all players will achieve a superior outcomeif they cooperate. Effective ethical codes can help to induce cooperative behavior andthereby contribute to resolve endemic free-rider problems (Arrow 1973; Beckert2002a). The significance of morality in principal-agent situations is no less important.It has already been described by Max Weber (1984) in his treatment of the role ofProtestant sects in American business life. Weber observed that sect members aretrusted in business relations disembedded from the local community due to an effec-tive ethical code that will bind the behavior of the sect member even when conductingbusiness with complete strangers. Hence the ethical code allows actors to engage inAn increasingly relevant counter-example is fake medication. Particularly in Third Worldcountries, patients are increasingly confronted with bogus medications that either contain noactive ingredients or even include substances that are poisonous. Pharmaceutical companiesare not only worried about this tendency because it effects their business through a loss inshort term sales, but also because it can lead to market failure due to a loss in customer confi-dence in the effectiveness of medications.Granovetter (1985) has made an important point that the effectiveness of behavioral normsdepends not only on value convictions, but especially on the concrete structures of social rela-tions.Beckert: The Moral Embeddedness of Markets9mutually beneficial transactions that are otherwise considered too risky and wouldnot take place. Both parties in the exchange profit. In other words, morality can helpto prevent market failure and thereby increases the efficiency of the system.Prisoner dilemma situations and principal-agent problems both show little ambiva-lence with regard to the consequences of commitment-guided behavior for marketoutcomes – morality has almost exclusively positive effects. If the logic described byGeorge Akerlof (1970) for the used car market holds true, then not only the principal(the buyer of the car) is better off if he or she can rely on the accuracy and complete-ness of the information revealed, but also the agent himself is better off. Otherwise themarket would fail to come into existence or more costly monitoring devices wouldneed to be introduced. The same holds true for labor relations where a lack of anyother motives besides personal gain will have negative effects for productivity (Akerlof1984). A similar argument can be made with regard to professional ethics that are acoordinating force in the exchange relations between laypeople and expert systems.5Group solidarityA closely related type of morally guided behavior affecting markets is “group solidar-ity.” It is based on the pooling of resources. Group solidarity differs from “coopera-tion” by drawing a boundary between those actors covered by the moral obligationsand those not covered by these obligations. Through this boundary of exclusion – ornetwork closure (Coleman 1990) – group solidarity achieves an ambivalent status asthe moral principles are only coordinating behavior within the group. Behavior can benon-moralistic, purely self-interested with regard to the consequences of decisions foroutsiders. Solidarity is a non-universalistic ethic (Bayertz 1998).Looking at social relations within the group, “group solidarity” has characteristicssimilar to “cooperation.” It is a mechanism for improvement of one’s own situationand that of other group members by overcoming free-riding. Solving free-rider prob-lems is a precondition for the effective pooling of resources. In modern capitalist5The only ambiguity arising in the prisoner dilemma and in principal-agent situations is withregard to the trust-taker or agent. Particularly when the behavior of the agent cannot be com-pletely observed by the principals, it might be a more profitable strategy for him or her to al-ternate between moral (cooperation) and immoral (defection) strategies. Such mixed strate-gies do not necessarily lead to market failure, in part, because the exchange partner does nothave the information to know which strategy the agent actually follows. As experimental stud-ies in game theory show, there are other strategies besides unconditional cooperation thathave superior pay-offs for the trust-taker (agent) compared to unconditional cooperation. Forthe agent it may be sufficient to act partially morally to earn the full benefits of morality. Ho-wever, this behavior would not be covered by the notion of morality applied in this paper ac-cording to which moral behavior reflects counter-preferential choices.10MPIfG Discussion Paper 05 / 6economies the union movement is probably the most relevant empirical form ofgroup solidarity. Unions enhance the workers’ power positions in the industrial con-flict by credibly threatening to withdraw a significant amount of labor from the pro-duction process that cannot be substituted for in the short run. Unions do have theinstrumental goals of negotiating better wage settlements, working conditions orgreater job security. However, as Claus Offe and Helmut Wiesenthal (1985) haveshown, membership mobilization by unions cannot rely exclusively on rational in-strumental motivations, but it must also appeal to a moral obligation to participate,even if unions want to serve nothing “but the member’s individual utilitarian inter-ests” (Offe / Wiesenthal 1985: 183).Commitment-based behavior leading to the pooling of resources can have positiveconsequences for the instrumental goals of the group members. Its role in market effi-ciency, however, is highly contested. From a market-liberal perspective union solidar-ity amounts to a cartel that increases prices for labor and thereby leads to inefficientequilibria. Based on this claim, unions are seen as being responsible for unemploy-ment. This argument, however, does not go unchallenged. According to institutional-ist approaches in economics (and sociology), unions do play a constructive role inmarkets and general economic welfare by helping to institutionalize industrial con-flict, forcing companies to invest into their competitiveness and increasing consumerpurchasing power (e.g. Streeck / Schmitter 1985).The positive role of group solidarity has also been demonstrated in research on ethniceconomies (Portes / Sensenbrenner 1993). Here network closure can help overcomemarket failures that arise through discrimination. This can be exemplified by ethniceconomies in the U.S. In order to be able to start a company, some immigrant groups,who do not have access to American capital markets, come together in rotating creditassociations, pooling their assets and using them in turn to finance their individualbusinesses. This makes it possible to create firms, which otherwise would not havebeen established. Though these associations rely on intense reciprocal monitoring ofits members, they are also based on the moral implications of belonging to the sameethnic group.6 At the same time, non-members of the ethnic group are excluded fromthe benefits and thereby discriminated against through ascriptive criteria. This showsthe purely self-interested side of group solidarity with regard to non-members.Community or family based network closure is, however, by no means unequivocallypositive for the economic well-being of the members of the solidaristic community. Ifmoral codes demand that economically successful family (or community) memberssupport less successful members by transferring resources, these resources are notavailable for individual business investments. As observed by anthropologists, this caninhibit economic development and gives rise to avoidance strategies by which success-6The closure of the community was also a precondition for effective monitoring.Beckert: The Moral Embeddedness of Markets11ful entrepreneurs try to circumvent family obligations. One interesting strategy hasbeen observed in indigenous villages in Ecuador. Male owners of garment and leatherartisan shops convert to Protestantism. By doing so the entrepreneurs “remove them-selves from the host of social obligations for male family heads associated with theCatholic Church and its local organization” (Portes / Sensenbrenner 1993: 1339). Inmore general terms, this supports Max Weber’s claim that one of the chief causes forthe success of modern Western capitalism was that Protestantism guided economicexchange away from the close connectedness of economic affairs to social obligations.Weber (1986) alluded also to a further problematic consequence of distinguishingbetween a morality within the group and an external morality that is characterized bypure utilitarianism. He found this type of particularism in societies adhering to Con-fucianism and saw in it the reason for general mistrust becoming a dominant featurein all business relations reaching beyond the group’s boundaries. Not morality as suchbut a morality that is only valid for the family and the clan was a factor that preventedthe development of extensive exchange relations.Blocked exchangeThe third type of morally guided behavior in markets I will call – using a term intro-duced by Michael Walzer (1983) – “blocked exchange.” Blocked exchange refers tothe prohibition or restriction of the monetary exchange of certain objects or servicesbased on moral codes. It is the opposite of cooperation where the function of moralityis to enable market transactions. Blocked exchanges prevent the market exchange ofcertain goods and services by keeping them outside the market realm.7Which transactions are blocked changes historically and differs between societies.Therefore it is not possible to make a finite list of goods and services to which ex-change restrictions apply. Two economically crucial fields where such changes haveoccurred are the limitations of charging interest for lending money and the abolitionof slavery. Cultural differences can be seen in religiously motivated taboos on the con-sumption of certain food products like pork.Despite historical and social variance it is possible to list categories of goods that arelikely to be restricted from monetary exchange in modern societies. One category areexchanges that affect the human body. It is prohibited to buy another person (slavery7Societies may succeed only incompletely in the enforcement of such blockages. This does not,however, invalidate the claim that certain exchanges are morally rejected and that subsequentrestrictions do have effects on the way these goods and services are exchanged.12MPIfG Discussion Paper 05 / 6and adoption).8 The commercial sale of body parts for medical reasons is mostly for-bidden (organ markets); in many countries women are prohibited from carrying achild to term for another, infertile woman (reproductive medicine); and the sale ofsexual services is restricted and even prohibited in many countries (prostitution). Asecond realm is the market exchange of political influence and offices. The purchaseof political decisions is called corruption and as such illegal. The third realm are legalclaims and obligations that cannot be purchased or sold. There is no market for trad-ing criminal punishment. The rights to vote, to freedom of expression or to freelyexercise one’s religious beliefs are all non-marketable.9In general terms, blocked exchanges are characterized by the separation of the goodsor services that are connected to “sacred” (Durkheim) social values from the “pro-fane” sphere of the market. It is not instrumental rationality that motivates exchangeblockages but rather value rationality (Weber), i.e., the belief in the value of an actionindependent of its consequences for oneself or for others. As Durkheim has argued,the act of establishing such taboos is an important aspect of the identity of a socialgroup. This implies that blocked exchanges cannot be explained by their contributionto economic efficiency. The idea that political decisions and human beings cannot bebought might have positive economic consequences. Nevertheless, the justification forprohibiting corruption or abolishing slavery is not based on an economic rationalebut rooted in social values which discredit corruption and slavery on moral grounds.Even if norms cannot be explained functionally, it is possible to ask for economic con-sequences of restrictions on specific exchanges since they do not have merely moralrelevance, but have functional consequences for the economic system as well. Accord-ing to Max Weber’s theory of rationalization the (originally religiously motivated)decoupling of exchange from moral obligations was one of the crucial preconditionsfor the development of a modern, functionally differentiated economy. The dissolu-tion of religious restrictions on money lending, the decoupling of exchange from par-ticularistic privileges and the development of modern labor markets were among themost important developments in this process. A case for positive economic effectsstimulated by the decoupling of economic exchange from moral restrictions has beenanalyzed by Viviana Zelizer (1979) in her research on the development of the life in-surance industry in nineteenth-century America. This industry was originally blockedby moral objections, primarily expressed by women, who refused to receive a “pre-mium” for their husband’s death. For many years this moral conviction blocked thedevelopment of an effective financial instrument for the economic protection of wid-ows.89Labor markets have the characteristic that not the person itself is bought but rather his or herlabor power.A much more complete list of blocked exchanges is provided in Walzer (1983).Beckert: The Moral Embeddedness of Markets13It is not possible here to show the consequences of blocked exchanges in detail. Thiswould demand a close discussion of each morally motivated restriction on marketexchange. What I want to illustrate briefly, however, is that the economic effects ofblocked exchanges show profound ambivalences with regard to individual welfare andmacroeconomic efficiency. While the aforementioned examples point to negativeeconomic consequences, examples for positive economic effects from restrictions ofmarket exchange come easily to mind. Such effects can be attributed to the blockageof the purchasing of political decisions, as can be seen from the examples in corrup-tion-ridden countries. Also, the restrictions on the use of labor power – for instancethe prohibition of child labor – have positive economic implications regarding thefuture productivity of children.One complication with regard to welfare effects derives from the following paradoxi-cal effect that has been observed in the market for blood (Titmuss 1971). The bloodmarket – and possibly other markets for goods taken from the human body as well –has an untypical supply curve. The introduction of an exchange market for blood doesnot leave the supply of voluntary blood donations unaffected; where blood supplybecomes a commercial activity, donors feel less responsibility to continue donating it.Hence, monetary compensation leads to a reduction in voluntary supply. This result,which contradicts economic reasoning, cites economic reasons for organizing blooddonations as a gift.Finally, the prohibition of markets for moral reasons might have unintended side ef-fects that must be examined. One important aspect is that the prevention of marketsgives way to the emergence of illegal markets that have consequences usually seen associally and individually negative. Such markets emerge when not all actors submit tothe morally demanded behavior. This can be observed not only in the case of (illegal)markets for organs. The prohibition of prostitution undermines the protection ofillegal sex industry workers and makes them especially vulnerable; the prohibition ofcertain narcotics leads to the emergence of drug dealers, crime and serious problemsfor public health. Through these effects, the morally motivated prohibition of marketsshows profound moral and economic dilemmas.AltruismThe fourth type of morally motivated behavior relevant for markets is “altruism.”Altruism is defined by a voluntary self-commitment to behavior based on value thatinflicts costs on oneself for the benefit of others. Altruism has several forms. The mosteconomically significant one is the voluntary inclusion of otherwise externalized costs.This is the core arena of business ethics, fair trade and socially conscientious con-sumer choices. If companies voluntarily abstain from hiring child labor, pay livingwages and protect the natural environment in which they operate their plants, they14MPIfG Discussion Paper 05 / 6increase their costs (i.e., their shareholder’s or customer’s costs) for the benefit ofstakeholders like their employees and neighborhood communities. By now, voluntarycodes of conduct have led to the establishment of an international standard on socialaccountability (SA 8000). Some large retailers purchase only from manufacturers thatcomply with the SA 8000 standard (Biggart / Delbridge 2004). This can be seen as anindicator for an increasing “moralization of markets.”It is, however, debatable to what extent compliance with standards of social or envi-ronmental accountability does indeed reflect altruism. Companies might simply at-tempt to avoid conflicts with important stakeholders by complying with social ac-countability standards or create an image as socially conscientious businesses as aneffective argument in their marketing strategies. If profit strategies motivate the com-pliance of companies to standards of social and environmental accountability, theirbehavior is not covered by the notion of altruism. While the significance of altruismin business behavior is ultimately an empirical question, two theoretical points can bemade. First, the market mechanism limits the possibility of altruistic choices that can-not be turned into increased revenues. Managers in a market economy are structurallyforced to orient their decisions towards profit making. Any other behavior will lead toa loss in profits and a reduction in market share. Second, the role of the marketmechanism does not imply that decisions are determined by the market. Most organi-zations do have significant slack that allows for inefficient decisions without jeopard-izing the survival of the company. Moreover, if one assumes that, under conditions ofcomplexity and fundamental uncertainty of outcomes, managers cannot identify op-timal strategies, the perspective of market determination of business decisions isflawed. Under such conditions managers will base their decisions on culturally legiti-mated conceptualizations of rationality. This constitutive role of culture allows for theintroduction of ethically motivated decisions into firm behavior despite market pres-sures towards efficiency (Beckert 2002b).Regardless of whether it reflects genuine altruism or not, the addition of moral con-siderations into the market does change the way business is conducted. Pressure tofind ethically reflective strategies develops mostly as a result of investor and consumerchoices. Investment fund managers might invest only in companies that have progres-sive policies towards gays and lesbians or that comply with standards of social ac-countability. An interesting example is also the rising field of Islamic banking. Hereinvestments are only made to companies that comply with “Islamic values” (Biggart/Delbridge 2004: 39). This is a form of altruism on the investor’s side if the investormust assume that his investment will have a lower return because he or she forgoesmore lucrative alternative investment opportunities. Consumers show altruistic actionorientations, for instance, by buying more expensive goods from a neighborhoodstore, instead of purchasing from Wal-Mart, because they believe in the value of hav-Beckert: The Moral Embeddedness of Markets15ing neighborhood stores. Consumer boycotts on the other hand express condemna-tion of certain business practices by consumers. Consumers are willing to avoid aproduct or store in order to support practices that comply with their values.10But what are the economic consequences of such altruistic, value directed allocationsof capital and consumer purchasing power? They are costly for the investor or theconsumer in monetary terms. One pays a higher price for bread in the local grocerystore compared to purchasing it from Wal-Mart. One does without apples from SouthAfrica if they are produced under Apartheid conditions, even if they are a better eco-nomic value. One invests in certain mutual funds even though one expects a lowerrate of return compared to alternative investment opportunities. These are counter-preferential choices if one assumes selfishness is the standard for economic choices.11The story becomes more complicated once attention is shifted to the producing firms,countries and traders that are subject to the value based consumer and investorchoices. A shift in allocation of investment capital and consumer purchasing powerdue to altruistic decision-making is beneficial only to those companies, industries orcountries that are favored by the social values. It is economically detrimental to thoseparties which are negatively discriminated against. Looking at macroeconomic conse-quences, the loading of economic exchange relations with value orientations that arefollowed through altruistic decisions may be problematic as well. They might lead to aparticularization of exchange which undermines competition. It contradicts the func-tional differentiation of the economy, i.e., its detachment from substantial value con-victions that makes economic exchange non-discriminatory and inclusive. If decisionsare based on altruism, capital is not allocated exclusively under criteria of economicefficiency. Moreover, any judgment of altruism must consider that, given the complexinterrelations within the economy, effects may be highly unspecific and contaminatedby unintended consequences that may outweigh their positive intentions (Luhmann1993: 136). Boycotts may also hurt those actors whose interests shall be protected.12Altruism can have similar non-intended effects as the blockage of exchange does.10 Despite these costs, it is debatable to what extent socially conscientious consumer behaviorqualifies as altruism. Though its declared intention is the principle-based increase of the wel-fare of others, this does not exclude the maximization of one’s own utility. This is the case ifthe well-being of alter ego forms part of the utility function of ego. This assumes, however,contrary to standard economic models, that utility functions are not independent. FollowingAmartya Sen (1977), such choices can nevertheless be characterized as moral behavior as longas the personal utility is not the reason for them.11 These value-oriented allocations of money can be integrated into an economic decision-making model that demands only coherence of choices.12 Boycotts are morally ambivalent. They might be seen as positive by society if values are ex-pressed that find widespread acceptance. The act of boycotting products from South Africaduring the Apartheid regime found broad social support. But what if investment is directed tocompanies upon the condition that they avoid hiring foreigners or Jews? What about boycott-ing Korean groceries in black neighborhoods of Los Angeles? For the moral evaluation of al-16Trojan altruismMPIfG Discussion Paper 05 / 6A further way in which “morality” can enter markets I want to call “Trojan altruism.”This is not a type of moral behavior, but refers to the strategic use of substantial valueorientations for one’s own benefit and at the cost of others. Trojan altruism is deceit-ful. There are several examples that stand at least under suspicion to form cases ofTrojan altruism. The first one is food aid to Third World countries. Food aid increasessupply in local markets, causes the depreciation of prices and thereby drives local pro-ducers out of the market. It can also contribute to a change in demand by influencingthe taste of consumers and thereby decrease demand for local crops. The dependencycreated through the destruction of local agricultural production is at the same timebeneficial to food exporting countries in the developed world.The suspicion of Trojan altruism also plays a role in current political discourse aboutstandards of social and environmental accountability in global production systems.Codes of social accountability are increasingly honored in business transactions withThird World suppliers. Prison labor, child labor, sweatshop working conditions andpollution of the environment are prime issues. The definition of the codes of conducttakes place mostly in the North. This opens the possibility that the enforcement of aseemingly morality based standard – for instance the policy not to buy products madethrough the use of child labor – is in fact a hidden enforcement of a competitive dis-advantage for Third World countries, implying additional hardship for the poor. Inmany countries, child labor is a crucial source of family income and low wages are oneof the few competitive advantages of the economies of the South. The same argumentcan be made with regard to standards of environmental protection. To make thispoint more systematically: Altruism might reflect a paternalistic definition of interestsof the South13 by people in the North that have little to do with the interests people ofthe South actually have. This suspicion of paternalistic definition of interests becamean important dispute between NGOs from the North and the South in the anti-globalization movement in recent years.ConclusionWhat can we learn from the proposed distinction of types of moral behavior in mar-kets? The argument pursued in this paper was that the role of morality for marketoutcomes is deeply ambivalent. Market-liberal objections to any type of coordinationtruism, the concrete values at stake must be considered. This presupposes a principle for theregulation of value conflicts.13 This is parallel to Lukes (1974) third face of power.Beckert: The Moral Embeddedness of Markets17devices but self-interest don’t do justice to the problems emerging from unequal ini-tial endowments, monopolistic market structures, external effects, free-riding andprincipal-agent problems. This, on the other hand, does not imply that morality baseddecision-making can be seen as unequivocally positive for the efficiency of marketoutcomes. Morality might be discriminatory to outsiders, hinder the functional dif-ferentiation of the economy and block markets that would be beneficial for at leastsome market participants.These profound ambivalences disqualify all positions of unqualified rejection of mo-rality as an action orientation of market participants. However, they also pinpoint tobenefits of demoralization of market exchange. The typology introduced identifiesdifferent implications of morality for the efficiency of market outcomes for the differ-ent types. Mostly positive effects can be attributed to cooperation, i.e., moral behaviorin the context of problems associated with free-riding and principal-agent situations.In these situations, ethical codes are one mechanism by which market failure can beavoided and more efficient outcomes achieved. By contrast, exchange blockages ap-pear profoundly ambiguous, as they represent values in a society. As an ideal type,their enforcement is independent from their consequences for personal utility andmacroeconomic welfare effects. They can nevertheless contribute to economic well-being, for instance by blocking the purchase of political decisions (corruption). Theycan, on the other hand, prevent the functional differentiation of the economy andmight result in unintended consequences like the emergence of illegal markets. Whileit might be politically decided to reduce the scope of markets by legally blocking theexchange of certain goods and services, these non-intended consequences must bereflected in any consequentialist moral judgment of such restrictions. Altruism trans-ports substantial value orientations into the realm of the economy as well. Its evalua-tion depends on the values that are enacted but also on the unintended effects itcauses. Altruism can give moral justification to redistributive policies and therebyhelp to integrate the issue of equity into a market economy. Group solidarity has am-bivalent consequences too. It can lead to the cartelization of market exchange and itexcludes outsiders. On the other hand, it can also help stabilize markets, reduce powerdifferentials between different social groups and help to pool resources for invest-ments that would otherwise be unobtainable. Finally, Trojan altruism is a parasitic useof morality that does not find moral legitimation. Its effects are clearly negative, basedon the criterion of Pareto efficiency, since it aims at gaining advantages at the cost ofthe other side of the exchange.While the typology does not lead to unambiguous distinctions with regard to the wel-fare effects of the four specific forms of commitment based behavior, it does provideinsights into the specific problems which are characteristic for the different types.Moreover, it indicates that the moral embeddedness of the economy is not a dysfunc-tional relic from premodern times but rather an integral part of the efficient function-ing of markets. At the same time, the role of morality in the market cannot be reducedto its economic functions. The observation of inefficiencies due to moral orientations18MPIfG Discussion Paper 05 / 6of actors does not itself give justification to condemn these expressions of value ra-tionality. Instead, they demonstrate that economies work within the context of amoral universe that itself cannot be reduced to criteria of economic efficiency. Theambivalence of morality for market outcomes is due to the fact that markets necessar-ily operate within a social field in which economic and non-economic values merge.This can be beneficial to economic outcomes or inhibit economic efficiency. Thetheoretical insight emerging from the ambivalent role of morality on markets is thatno economy will ever be “only economic” even if this inhibits some of its economicfunctions.Beckert: The Moral Embeddedness of Markets19References<ref>Akerlof, George A., 1970: The Market for “Lemons”: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mecha-nism.
