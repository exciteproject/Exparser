It shows that although radical right parties represent a sourceof opposition to the EU, within the EP they express their dissent making use of the rules ofthe game, voting with the opposition more than the other forces do, but voting almost asmuch with the majority. The party public office in the EP is inserted in the legislative processand even more collusive with the other parties of both sides of the political spectrum than theEurosceptical rhetoric and statements of central office makes the public believe.KeywordsRadical right parties, attitudes, EU, Euromanifestos, MEPs.General note on contentThe opinions expressed in this paper are those of the author and not necessarily those of the IHSContentsI.

It is a theme that has acquired greater salience within the political discourse of thisarea, to the point that these parties have become the main stronghold of EU-pessimism(Mudde 2007). Particularly, their political discourse has largely internalized the EU issue,making the radical right the political area where this issue has become more salient (Kriesi2007). In this paper, I analyze the radical right‘s attitudes toward the EU focusing in particularon the level of congruence between the programmatic statements and the voting behavior oftheir MEPs. Notably, the aim of the paper is to describe the problem along the followinglines:1) an analysis of the level of congruence of party positions within the programmaticsupply of these parties, as well as within the voting behavior of their MEPs;2) an analysis of the level of congruence between the political discourse of the partycentral office and the voting behavior of the party in public office.It is an approach that aims at integrating several dimensions of party attitudes toward the EUexamined by earlier studies, such as the dimension of the political discourse that wasexamined through the party manifestos for the European elections (Gabel & Hix 2004), andof the institutional behavior of politicians that was examined through the voting behavior ofMEPs (Hix et al. 2007). In sum, through the analysis of party Euromanifestos and roll-callvotes in the European Parliament, I will produce a description of what radical right partiessay about Europe, what their MEPs do in order to translate the party rhetoric into concretepolitical action, and how congruent these two dimensions of the party stance on the EU are.From the theoretical point of view, the paper will contribute to understanding politics and thebehavior of the radical right in different ways. Firstly, the results of the comparative analysiswill allow us to determine whether the radical right behaves cohesively enough to present thecharacter of a real party family. Or, alternatively, it will determine whether the empiricalevidence supports the argument – maintained by the founder of the German RepublicansFranz Schönhuber among others (in Mudde 2007: 159) – that a genuine European radicalright does not really exist.Secondly, assessing the level of congruence between the attitudes of different faces of partyorganization is a relevant problem that current research has just started to address (Conti, Cotta &Tavares de Almeida 2010). Particularly, assessing the extent to which the official party stance on theEU overlaps with that of party officials holding public office is meaningful for a comprehensiveunderstanding of the broad phenomenon of party attitudes toward the EU. Recent research shows thatcitizens are way less pro-European than politicians (Best, Lengyel & Verzichelli forthcoming). Given thegap in the support for the EU between citizens and politicians, it is particularly relevant to study2 — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — I H Swhether the party central office pools together with the party in public office or whether it takes morecautious positions. In other words, does the stance of the MEPs within the European Parliament (EP)reflect the party discourse on the EU developed for usage in the electoral market? The comparisonbetween the attitudes of the party central office and those of the MEPs presented in this paper willallow us to answer this question.I H S — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — 3II. The Contents of Euroscepticism:Right Says About the EUWhat theRadicalIn order to analyze the attitudes of radical right parties toward the EU and to describe themain components of these attitudes (dissatisfaction with the defense of national interests,opposition to EU policies, protest against loss of sovereignty) I will examine the partypositions on a set of specific issues. I will start my analysis with a study of partyEuromanifestos, the programs that the national parties present for the EP elections. Thesedocuments provide a useful representation of the ideological structure and of the policypreferences of parties. Radical parties tend to have a particularly good electoral performanceat the EP elections given the second-order nature of the scrutiny, and thanks to the PRnature of the electoral system. Their visibility in these elections tends to be high and theirprogrammatic assertiveness is consequently also high. It is important to note thatEuromanifestos are usually issued by the party central office and they present the overallparty line for use with the party rank and file and with the electorate. Thus, these documentsreflect a unitary vision of the party and do not offer much evidence of any eventual intra-partydivision. This limitation that is intrinsic to any manifesto analysis is also the starting point foran interesting research question: Is a party cohesive enough in its stance on the EU? As wasmentioned in the introduction, this paper begins to address the problem by means of acomparison between the analysis of party manifestos that I present in this section, and thatof the voting behavior of the MEPs in the following section.Given the level of complexity and the increasing number of policy areas where the EU is involved, itseems useful to break-down party attitudes across many aspects of European integration. This attemptallows for a disentanglement of party attitudes across different dimensions of the EU process and adetermination whether the same stance is confirmed across such dimensions. For this purpose, I willfocus the analysis in particular on the dimensions of representation and policy. It is a research strategythat aims at including several functional aspects of supranational integration in the analysis. In therecent past, the theoretical debate (Bartolini 2007; Benhabib 2002; Cotta e Isernia 2009) as well assome empirical studies (Conti & Memoli 2010; Hooghe, Marks & Wilson 2004; Hubé & Rambour 2010;Gabel & Hix 2004) have defined these dimensions as relevant for the analysis of the EU impact onmember states and of the response of political actors to such an impact.4 — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — I H STable 1 – The coding scheme: dimensions, themes and positions in the analysisDimensionRepresen-tationThemeMembershipPosition (short)Position (extended)FavourableopportunitiesNational action in Leadershipthe EUPolicyForeign policyDefense policyImmigration pol.Negative constraintsMixedNo referenceCooperationDefense/rejectionMixedNo referenceSupranational onlyNational onlySub-national onlySupranat. + nationalSupranat. + sub-nat.Supra. + nat. + sub-nat.National + sub-nat.No referenceEurope has mainly brought benefitsand improvements to the country.European integration has mainlyproduced good results for thecountry.

On the contrary, radical parties are not inclined tochange their attitudes on the EU, they tend instead to be rather stable in their opposition(Szcerbiack & Taggart 2003, 2008) that, over time, has only become more salient, especiallyin the case of the radical right (Kriesi 2007). We expect, therefore, variations across time tobe quite limited in scope, but I will report them anyway when they are deemed relevant.The analysis starts with an examination of the level of occurrence of the selected themeswithin the Euromanifestos. In table 2, we find evidence of the fact that, in their documentsradical parties generally refer to such themes as often as (or even more often than)mainstream parties do. Certainly, the table does not contain any information about thedirection of the positions expressed on the specific issues in the documents. However, it wasrelevant to find confirmation that the analyzed themes do play an important role in the partydiscourse on the EU. They are important components of the party stance on the EU.Although across parties some differences can be found in terms of frequency of occurrence,overall, the selected themes recurred frequently in the Euromanifestos (in between 51.7 and88.8 per cent of Euromanifestos, depending on the theme). Hence, we can be confident thatthey represent good empirical referents for the analysis of party attitudes toward the EU asthey really structured the programmatic supply provided in the Euromanifestos.1 INTUNE (Integrated and United: A quest for Citizenship in an an ever closer Europe), an Integrated Projectfinanced by the VI Framework Programme of the European Union (CIT3-CT-2005-513421). The research in thispaper was also supported by the Italian National project ―Il processo di integrazione europea in una fase di stalloistituzionale: mutamenti nelle sfere della rappresentanza politica, dei processi decisionali e della cittadinanzasociale‖ financed by the Ministery of Education (PRIN 2007).2 Among these documents there are thirty Euromanifestos of the radical right.3 The countries included in the analysis were the following ones: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, France,Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain and United Kingdom.4 In particular, only two Euromanifestos of the radical right date from 1989, the other Euromanifestos date from1994-2004.6 — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — I H STable 2 – Euromanifestos that mention the analyzed themes (percentages)ThemeMembershipNational action in EuropeForeign policyDefense policyImmigration policyMentioned in % of EuromanifestosAll partiesMainstream parties88.877.271.371.451.7877771.773.550Radicalparties95.378.169.864.157.8Source: INTUNE project, University of Siena, CircapThe analysis moves now to a more in-depth examination of the direction of party positions.For this purpose, I applied multinomial logistic regression models for the analysis of thecontent analytic variables drawn from the Euromanifestos. This technique allowed me toestimate the likelihood for radical parties to express Eurosceptical positions as compared tomainstream parties. Subsequently, within the radical party category I separated left fromright. The comparison of attitudes between parties of different ideological orientations allowsus to understand the phenomenon of Euroscepticism comparatively and to insert theseattitudes within the broader context of inter-party competition and of contestation of the EUissue. Precisely, multinomial logistic regression models estimate the likelihood of differentcases to belong to each category of the dependent variable when compared to a referencecategory. For example, in table 3, the ExpB coefficient estimates the likelihood of eachcategory of the dependent variable ‗membership‘ to occur compared to the referencecategory ‗favourable opportunities‘. In other words, the model estimates how likely it is to findin the Euromanifestos (of the mainstream and radical parties respectively) ‗no reference‘, a‗mixed‘ or a ‗negative‘ evaluation of the country membership, compared to the referencecategory ‗favourable opportunities‘. I found that in their Euromanifestos, radical parties havealmost eleven times (ExpB=10.75) greater a likelihood to represent membership as anegative constraint than to represent it as a positive opportunity. On the contrary, suchlikelihood is almost null (ExpB=0.2) for mainstream parties.5 In particular, I found that 70% ofthe Euromanifestos of the radical right (and 64.7% of those of the radical left) expressed anegative evaluation of the country membership. Consequently, the expectation of a broadEurosceptism rooted in the radical parties is confirmed by the data.5 I considered mainstream parties to be those belonging to the following party families: Christian democrats,socialists, liberals, conservatives, regionalists (with the exception of the Northern League), greens and some othermoderate parties on indication of the national experts involved in the research. I categorized Communists, extremeleft, nationalists and the extreme right as radical parties.I H S — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — 7Table 3 – Party positions on membershipEU Membership evaluated asMixed favourable/negativeNo referenceNegative constraintsReference category: favourableopportunities2 148.222SRi2g. ..04020N 298Note: *** significant at 0.001 level ** significant at 0.01 levelSource: INTUNE project, University of Siena, CircapMainstream partiesRadical partiesMainstream partiesRadical partiesMainstream partiesRadical partiesB-.811.25-1.38-.28-1.492.37Std.

In order to find evidence of this, I analyzed how parties think the nationalgovernment should behave in the EU arena. In table 4, ‗defence/rejection‘ is the reference category. Ifound that mainstream parties are eight times (ExpB=8.18) more likely to express a preference for acooperative behavior, thus for an acquiescent conduct of the national government. Furthermore, theyare over five times more likely (ExpB=5.63) to prefer the leadership of the national government withinthe EU arena, hence to be in favor of a voice option. In the end, as it was easy to predict, mainstreamparties are divided on the assertiveness and the role that the national government should have withinthe EU. On the contrary, the category of radical parties is more focused on the ‗defence/rejection‘solution, while the likelihood for the Euromanifestos of these parties to fall in any other category is notsignificant.6 However, it is important to highlight the differences in the attitudes of the two extremes.The ‗defence/rejection‘ category occurs in 43.3% of Euromanifestos of radical right parties ascompared to 6.7% of those of the radical left whose most recurrent category (38.2%) is instead that ofcooperation7 (occurring in only 6.7% of Euromanifestos of the radical right). These results show that,although Euroscepticism is deeply rooted in the radical parties under the form of a broad attitude, forinstance when they evaluate country membership, when we break-down the broad stance into morespecific attitudes we find that Euroscepticism is definitely more pronounced in the radical right.6 Changing the reference category does not change the result, as radical parties have a tendency to concentratetheir preference in the ‗defence/rejection‘ category.7 In particular, Izquierda Unida and Synaspimos are the main advocate of this solution within the radical left.8 — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — I H STable 4 – Party positions on national action in the EUThe national government shouldprioritizeNo referenceLeadershipCooperationMixedReference category: defense/rejection2 207.827SRi2g. ..50200N 298Note: *** significant at 0.001 level * significant at 0.05 levelSource: INTUNE project, University of Siena, CircapMainstream partiesRadical partiesMainstream partiesRadical partiesMainstream partiesRadical partiesMainstream partiesRadical partiesB1.57-.401.72-.742.10-.33-.09-3,04Std.

In particular, we findthe same tendency for attitudes toward foreign and defense policy. In table 5, mainstreamparties show 9.9 and 9.2 times greater likelihood respectively for the exclusive EUcompetence and a shared EU-national competence, as compared to the reference categoryof the exclusive national competence. So, mainstream parties are rather divided in terms ofdegree of involvement of the EU in foreign policy, something that could explain the difficultiesin integrating the ex-Second Pillar of the EU. However, they agree overwhelmingly on somekind of involvement of the EU, while they voice a preference for the exclusive nationalcompetence only very rarely. The same tendency can be found for defense policy (tab. 6) asthe preference of mainstream parties for the exclusive European competence and for theshared EU-national competence is 12.3 and 10.3 times greater than for the referencecategory of exclusive national competence. For both policies, values for the radical partiesare instead not significant. The reason can be found in the dispersion of their preferencesacross different categories. Dispersion occurs between radical left and radical right, as wellas across countries. Overall, the preference of radical parties for the exclusive nationalcompetence exceeds that for any other option. They voice this sovereignist stance in foreignand defense policy in 27% and 25% of their Euromanifestos respectively, without anyparticular distinction between left and right. However, somewhat unexpectedly, the share forthe other categories is also similar. Notably, over time the radical left – but not the radicalright – becomes more supportive of the EU competence, until a peak in 2004 when 66.6% ofI H S — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — 9the Euromanifestos of the radical left supports the EU competence (either exclusive orshared) in foreign policy and 53.9% in defense policy8.In sum, differences between mainstream and radical parties are remarkable since the EU involvementin these two policy areas is much less popular with radical parties. However, only a minority of radicalparties rejects the EU involvement in principle, while on this issue the radical left has becomeincreasingly aligned with mainstream parties over time. In the end, the radical right is the mainstronghold of opposition against the communitarisation of foreign and defense policy. However, evenfor these parties, Euroscepticism is not absolute. Although integration of these policies deeplychallenges one of the core values of the radical right, namely the defense of national sovereignty, itsnational components are divided on what is the best level of competence. In some countries, radicalright parties support some EU competence in foreign and defense policy9 as they see the EU as apotential barrier against globalization and U.S dominance that they oppose more fiercely: against bothforces, any national scale action would be powerless, especially from countries of small size orreduced strategic power. Ultimately, although at various degrees and certainly more to the left than tothe right, the EU has acquired some legitimacy as a level of governance even within the programmaticsupply of radical parties. Euroscepticism in this sphere prevails in the radical right, but as we haveseen, not unanimously.Table 5 – Party positions on foreign policyFavorite level of competenceNo referenceExclusive EuropeanShared European/nationalReference category: exclusivenational2 285.127SRi2g. ..06040N 298Note: *** significant at 0.001 levelSource: INTUNE project, University of Siena, CircapMainstream partiesRadical partiesMainstream partiesRadical partiesMainstream partiesRadical partiesB2.09.112.29-.262.22-.19Std.

On the one hand, the likelihood of apreference for the exclusive EU competence or the shared EU-national competence on theside of mainstream parties is almost eight (ExpB=7.75) and five (ExpB=5.13) times greaterthan it is for exclusive national competence (reference category). However, a lack ofreference to immigration issues is the most likely possibility for mainstream parties(ExpB=14.38). On the other hand, the preferences of radical parties are again dispersedamong different categories. Even more than for foreign and defense policy, such dispersionis to be attributed mainly to the radical left. As a matter of fact, the position of radical rightparties is more univocal as 42.9% of their Euromanfestos support the exclusive nationalcompetence in immigration policy. It is evidence of the fact that radical right parties maketheir programmatic supply on this issue very distinctive from that of the other parties andcharacterize their stance along the lines of a more openly nationalistic posture. Although lessthan half of the Euromanifestos of the radical right really favor the most nationalistic solution,the other more recurrent category is the no reference one, especially in the new memberstates10, while a preference for the EU involvement in the immigration policy is only residualamong radical right parties.1110 For example, in 2004, the Lithuanian National Centre Party and Party of National Progress, and the League ofPolish Families did not make any reference to the issue of the favourite level of competence in immigration policy.11 Only the Italian MSI-National Alliance in 1994 and the German Republicans in 1999-2004 supported theinvolvement of the EU in this policy.I H S — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — 11Table 7 – Party positions on immigration policyFavorite level of competenceNo referenceExclusive EuropeanShared European/nationalReference category: exclusivenational2 219.542PR-2value ..05040N 298Note: *** significant at 0.001 levelSource: INTUNE project, University of Siena, CircapMainstream partiesRadical partiesMainstream partiesRadical partiesMainstream partiesRadical partiesB2.670.522.05-0.471.63-0.58Std.

However, thisattitude is broad more than it is absolute, and most importantly, it is not univocal across theEuropean countries. Although still very criticized, the EU has acquired legitimacy by radicalright parties in some member states where its role as a policy-maker is relatively welcome.The very existence of the EU is therefore not questioned by these parties. TheEuroscepticism of the radical right is still quite strident, especially if one compares theirattitudes to those of mainstream parties and even of radical left parties whose oppositionagainst the EU has become more nuanced over time. Still, it would be difficult to talk about aprincipled opposition of the radical right against the EU when parties are so divided about therole the EU should play in the European system of governance.12 — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — I H SIII. HowParliamentRadicalRightPartiesVoteintheEuropeanThe paper now moves to the analysis of the institutional behavior of the MEPs of the radicalright. Specifically, I will examine whether they vote cohesively within the EP. As a matter offact, in the previous section it has already been shown that the programmatic supply of theradical right is characterized by some common positions, as well as by some importantdifferences. We now investigate whether these differences also translate into a diversebehavior of radical right MEPs within the EP. In addition, this part of the analysis allows us toshed a light on the problem of the level of coherence existing between the protest-basedrhetoric of radical right parties in the election campaign (however mitigated by specific policypositions that, as we have seen, are not so much opposed to the EU) and their institutionalbehavior after the elections.For the analysis, I have selected the EP group ‗Independence/Democracy‘ (IND/DEM) of the2004-2009 legislature. The group was created in 2004, when parties from the Eurosceptical‗Europe of Democracy and Diversities‘ group made an alliance with some parties from thenew member states. The most important parties of IND/DEM were the following12: the UKIndependence Party (UKIP), the League of Polish Families, the Italian Northern League(suspended in 2006 and then expelled from the group after the scandal of the t-shirt worn bythe party member Calderoli showing anti-Islamic cartoons), and the Movement for France.Additionally, some MEPs from Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Netherlands andSweden also took part in the group. However, other important radical right parties such asthe French Front National and the Vlaams Belang did not join IND/DEM and decided insteadto belong to the ‗Non Attached‘ group. By the end of the legislature, especially after theexpulsion of the Northern League, the group could rely on just 2.8 per cent of the seats in theEP. Definitely, this lack of unity within the EP of radical right parties gives evidence of a lackof cohesion of their intents and strategy. So the argument of whether they could beconsidered a genuine party family finds negative evidence here. At least, these parties arenot transnationally organized as most other party families are and this, in turn, creates animpediment for the establishment of greater coherence of action within this political area.This lack of transnational organization also creates a problem for the analysis carried in thispaper: due to dispersion of the radical right MEPs in various groups, any result on IND/DEMonly partially represents the radical right as a whole. Furthermore, the empirical referentconsidered in the two parts of the analysis is not identical, as the Euromanifesto dataexamined in the previous section referred to a larger number of radical right parties than thedata on the voting behavior of the MEPs of Independence/Democracy. However, I will showthat in spite of these limitations, it is still possible to produce some considerations and toadvance some tentative conclusions about the phenomena under analysis.12 The group ceased to exist in 2009 when some of its components united with the remnants of the ‗Union for aEurope of Nations‘ group to create a new group called ‗Europe of Freedom and Democracy‘.I H S — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — 13The first problem that I am going to explore concerns the internal cohesion within IND/DEM.For this purpose, in table 8 I have reported a measurement elaborated by Hix and Noury ofthe internal cohesion of the EP groups in the period 2004-2009 based on the roll-call votes(all data in this section are available on-line at http://www.votewatch.eu).13 It clearly emergedthat within the EP context, IND/DEM was the group with lower internal cohesion,comparatively as low as the Non-Attached group. To be more precise, their level of cohesionwas about half the average level (0.8) of all party groups with the exclusion of IND/DEM andthe Non-Attached. On the other extreme of the political spectrum, the European UnitedLeft/Nordic Green Left group (GUE-NGL) showed a level of internal cohesion in line with theabove mentioned average. Hence, the radical right was internally divided along its nationalcomponents much more than any other group of the EP was. Indeed, we only need to recallthat some ideological diversity also emerged in the Euromanifesto analysis, but strikinglywide divisions emerged in the way the radical right MEPs voted in the EP. It is interesting tonote that the low level of internal cohesion of the IND/DEM is also confirmed when wedisaggregate votes by policy areas, as scores tend to be close to the overall cohesion rate:0.5 for budgetary policy, economics, foreign and defense policy, culture andeducation;0.4 for justice and home affairs, unemployment, social policy, development,transportation, tourism, fishery, equal opportunities;0.3 for agriculture, environment, industry, energy, research, internal market.Precisely, among the parties in this group, the UKIP voted against the party line one out ofthree times and the League of Polish Families one out of five.14 Hence, among the largerparties that formed the group, the latter was the one that contributed more to determine theparty line. However, its defection rate of one fifth should not be ignored and it is the sign of arather undisciplined conduct and lack of leadership within the political group. Since weregistered an extremely low level of internal cohesion, this could not be explained by thedefections of the British and the Polish MEPS alone. It follows that the other MEPs of thegroup representing even smaller parties have all together defected the party line morefrequently.13For each vote, the group cohesion was calculated using the index of Rice: (Y-N)/(Y+N+A), where Y = nr. of votesin favour, N = nr. of votes against and A = nr. of abstentions. The cohesion rate of each group is the mean score ofall roll-call votes.14The other parties of IND/DEM have less than five representatives in the group. It is not possible to calculateloyalty scores for national groups with less than five MEPs. A national group is made up by MEPs from the samemember state who join the same European Political Group.14 — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — I H STable 8 – Cohesion index of the EP political groups (2004-2009)Cohesion indexEPP0.88PSE0.91ALDE0.89UEN0.76Greens0.91GUE-NGL0.85IND/DEM0.47NA0.44Source: http://www.votewatch.euHaving established that radical right parties within the EP are not cohesive, it is nowinteresting to analyze how they behave vis a vis the other parties. One underlyingcharacteristic of radical right parties is indeed their anti-system rhetoric. For this reason, theyhave alternatively been labeled as populist, extreme right, fascist, or protest-basedorganizations (Mudde 2007, 29). Indeed, at the national level, they often reject the systemfrom its constitutional foundations. At the same time, the system tends to exclude them; atthe national level several institutional barriers such as those coming from the electoral ruleshave been built in order to marginalize these parties. So, with only some exceptions andcontrary to mainstream parties, radical right parties are usually rooted on the ground of thesociety more than they are in public office. As a consequence, they are also largely excludedfrom public resources - consisting mostly of state financing - that are instead largelyavailable to cartel parties (Katz & Mair1995). Hence, at the national level radical right partiescan successfully represent themselves as separate from the system and their distinctivenessas a form of non-collusion and disinterestedness. They can do so especially when theycriticize the state elites, one of the main arguments in their rhetoric. What happens thenwhen we shift the focus of the analysis to the EU system? Is their anti-system protest alsotransferred to the EU level? We found that the Euromanfestos are rich in criticisms to thecountry membership in the EU. (table 3). Now we analyze whether such a broad stance alsocorresponds to an institutional practice of outsiders within the EP.In reality, the tendency of IND/DEM, as well as of the radical left, to a participatory and evencollusive behavior within the EP should not be underestimated (table 9). Although thenumber of times this group was part of a majority in the EP was the lowest among all partygroups, the total rate (46.2 per cent) is still considerable and certainly higher than we couldexpect from any anti-system force. Hence, in almost half of the cases, IND/DEM was part ofa parliamentary majority. To be sure, their votes only converged with large majoritiescomposed of at least two large parties (the European People‘s Party [EPP], the EuropeanSocialist Party [PSE], or the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe [ALDE]).Therefore, their vote was not necessary to build minimum winning coalitions, andconsequently their blackmail potential and coalition power remained very limited even whenthey joined a majority. Just as at the national level (where only few exceptions can be foundin countries such as Austria and Italy), also in the EP the radical right is largely non-influentfor the formation of coalitions. For this reason, it is surprising that they voted along the linesof a parliamentary majority so many times. Especially when we consider that only a fractionI H S — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — 15of the votes of IND/DEM converged with those of parliamentary majorities of centre-rightleaning parties (either EPP, ALDE or Union for the Europe of Nations [UEN]) and couldtherefore be justified on the bases of some common ideological inclinations. In most cases,the majority also included (to a greater or lesser degree) the PSE, the Greens, and the GUE-NGL. An in-depth analysis of the contents of the bills passed with the support of IND/DEMwould be necessary in order to discover the motivations for their institutional behavior – onethat could certainly not be labeled as the behavior of outsiders. It is, however, a researchgoal that goes beyond the scope of the analysis presented in this paper, but one that futureresearch should consider in order to shed light on this interesting phenomenon concerningthe institutional behavior of the public office of radical right parties.Table 9 – Times when EP political groups were part of a winning majority(percentages)Part of a winningmajorityPPE86PSE81.2ALDE85.7UEN75.3Greens60.2GUE-NGL51.9IND/DEM46.2Source: http://www.votewatch.euCertainly, convergence with the EP majority is also due to the consensual nature of the EPwhere decisions are often lowest common denominator agreements among the differentforces that are represented in this assembly. However, even from this perspective, we couldnot avoid defining the strategy of the radical right in the EP as either one of voice, or one ofacquiescence. Being that their votes converged with those of large coalitions and weretherefore not necessary to form a majority, we can hypothesize that the blackmail potential ofIND/DEM was really limited on those occasions, as well as their capacity to influence thefinal outcome in the decision-making process. Hence, their strategy should really becharacterized by acquiescence more than by a real capacity to voice their preferences andforce the other parties to compromise with them. In the end, it seems that radical right partiesare rather maximalists on the EU in their rhetoric (although even in this respect the analysisof Euromanifestos has shown that in some countries they accept the EU as a level ofgovernance) but they tend to exclude the most maximalist option of exit when they operatewithin the EU institutions. This result is also confirmed by the attendance rate (82.5%) to theplenary sessions of the EP by the MEPs of IND/DEM, a rate that is very close to the averageof the other (mostly mainstream) groups (84.6%). As we have seen, a vote with the majoritycorresponds to this high attendance rate in almost half of the cases and a vote against (orabstention) in the remaining part. Only when they vote against the majority do they expresstheir protest against the main groups, usually by voting with parties on the extremes of bothleft and right (Hagemann 2009). It is evident that radical right parties collect votes in the16 — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — I H SEuropean elections based on a broad Eurosceptical stance (with policy specific positionsthat are sometimes not as much Eurosceptical). However, once in the EP, it is important tonote that they express their dissent making use of the rules of the game, voting with theopposition more than the other forces do, but voting almost as much with the majority. Ifthese figures were known by the larger public, it would not be surprising if the protest-basedelectorate of these parties felt dissatisfied with their institutional conduct.It seems that the public office of these parties is way less anti-EU than the political discourseof their central office. There may be several explanations for this behavior. On the one hand,there might be a search for legitimacy on the part of these parties. They want to participate inthe decision-making process and they want to be considered credible coalition partners. Thiscould be achieved more easily in an assembly such as the EP where coalitions are formedon an issue-by-issue basis, rather than following pre-arranged coalition agreements betweeneither the groups or the national delegations. On the other hand, radical right parties mightbe aware of the advantages which come with representation in the EP. They can have apublic office that is often lacking at the national level where they are frequently excludedfrom institutional representation due to electoral rules, the impact of strategic voting in firstorder elections, or the marginalization by mainstream parties. The advantages ofrepresentation in the EP are not negligible, especially for small radical parties. Notably, froma financial point of view, parties represented in the EP have access to public financing, whichhas become so relevant for the survival of parties in contemporary times (Katz & Mair 1995,Aucante & Dézé 2008). Such funds come directly from the EU budget, in order to allow theorganizational functioning of the EP. As well, they come from the national budget under theform of ordinary contributions or reimbursements of the electoral expenses. Ultimately, eitherdirectly or indirectly, the EP is doing a lot for the financial and organizational survival of smallradical parties. Alternatively, we could look for other non-strategic explanations of theinstitutional behavior of radical right MEPs. Just like any other actor who is inserted in theEuropean decision-making system, they become gradually socialized to the practices andprinciples of the EU governance, through forms of interaction oriented toward consensualismthat in the long term create a sense of trust and identification with the institution and with thesystem at large (Schimmelfennig 2000). This could also explain why the radical right oftentakes a more pragmatic stance in the EP than the rhetoric of their central office wouldanticipate. None of these potential explanations can be examined in-depth in this paper, butcertainly knowledge on the radical right, as well as on EU politics, would greatly benefit fromthe analysis of these possible determinants of the party conduct in the EP. In the meanwhile,although it is not yet possible to talk about a radical right in the EU that is anti-establishmentbut open to government it seems there is already enough evidence to talk about a radicalright that is anti-establishment and part of the system.I H S — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — 17IV.ConclusionThe analysis that was carried out in this paper shows that the radical right is the party blockcharacterized by the lowest levels of internal cohesion in the whole context of the Europeanparty families. This finding holds true both in the analysis of ideology that was examinedthrough party Euromanifestos, and in that of institutional behavior shown by the data on theroll-call votes of the MEPs. The Euroscepticism of the radical right is well-known, howeverafter an accurate analysis, it showed that it is discontinuous and lacks a common visionacross its national party components. If this diversity was verified not only with respect to theEuropean issue but to other issues as well, there would be reason to question whether theradical right could be defined as a party family, or if it should instead be considered adisordered aggregation of national parties of erratic ideological positions.The analysis of two different arenas, namely a second-order national electoral arena and theEP institutional arena, very clearly show that the radical right in Europe is divided into aplethora of stances and policy preferences and by reciprocal enmities and politicalantagonism. From the analyses, it emerged that their ideological foundations, programmaticsupply and organizational features are so diverse that it even seems hard to group themunder a distinctive party family name. This finding reinforces Mudde‘s (2007) argument aboutthe necessity to classify parties that common wisdom tends to pinpoint within the radical rightwith more accuracy. Certainly, this paper shows that in Europe, a famille spirituelle groupingthe main parties of this political area is, in reality, hardly discernible and even the use of theconcept of party family could be incorrect when referring to the radical right.At the same time, a clear tendency toward a greater pragmatism and moderation of theMEPs of the radical right emerged in the paper as compared to the party programmaticannouncements. Although radical right parties represent a source of opposition within theEP, some of them also take part in parliamentary majorities in almost the same proportion.This phenomenon shows that there is a remarkable distance between the central office andthe public office of these parties, at least in terms of coherence between the statements ofthe former and the institutional conduct of the latter. Whether this is a conscious, or even astrategic game played by these parties, is a question that this paper has not addressed.Certainly, their conduct raises many questions that future research may address. Overall, theparty public office in the EP is more institutionalized, more inserted in the legislative processand even more collusive with the other parties of both sides of the political spectrum than therhetoric and statements of central office makes the public believe. The paper documentedthe ambivalence between a more Eurosceptical party central office and a more collusive EPpublic office. This conflicting valence between central office and public office could be a signof difficulty for these parties in playing the role of legislators and, at the same time, representa protest-based electorate. Especially in an assembly like the EP where there is not a cleargovernment to oppose and so the temptation to collude with the other parties can be18 — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — I H Samplified. Whether or not this phenomenon limits the capacity of radical right parties in theEP to represent their electorate - as they fail to deliver firm opposition against themainstream parties - is an interesting problem. At the same time, however, the level ofinformation of citizens about the activities in the EP is so low that a disappointing behavior ofthe MEPs would hardly result in a sanction vote in the following elections. So, it wasinteresting to document that in an assembly characterized by limited popular scrutiny as isthe EP, the conduct of some radical right parties is not one of principled opposition, it isactually less extreme than many would expect.I H S — Conti / The Radical Right in Europe — 19V.ReferencesAucante, Y. and A.
