Equality among Animals and Religious SlaughterFederico Zuolo ∗Abstract: »Gleichberechtigung unter Tieren und religiöse Schlachtung«. Currentlaws on the treatment of animals in all liberal countries demand that animalsbe stunned before being slaughtered in order to prevent their suffering. This isderived from a widely-shared concern for animal welfare. However, in manyWestern countries, exemptions from this legal requirement have been granted toJewish and Muslim communities so that they can continue to perform ritualslaughter. Hence, there seems to be a clash between the right to religious free-dom and the duty to minimize animal suffering during slaughter. In this paper, Iwant to propose a solution to this seemingly irreconcilable clash. To understandwhether these two principles are really incompatible, we need to establish exactlywhat they demand of us. I argue that there is no convincing reason to take thesuffering involved in the killing of animals more seriously than the suffering ex-perienced by animals during their lives (on farms). If so, we might demand thatritually slaughtered animals be “compensated” for their experiencing a morepainful death by raising these animals in better conditions than others.Keywords: Animal welfare, freedom of religion, non-discrimination, ritualslaughter.1.Introduction1Current laws on the treatment of animals in all liberal countries demand thatanimals be stunned before being slaughtered in order to prevent their suffering.In many Western countries, exemptions from this legal requirement have beengranted to Jewish and Muslim communities (Haupt 2007).2 But Muslim and∗ Federico Zuolo, Department of Political and Social Sciences, Free University of Berlin, Ih-nestrasse 22, 14195 Berlin, Germany; federico.zuolo@unipv.it.1 The research for this paper was carried out within the project ‘Feeding’ Respect.

Switzerland, Norway,Sweden, and Latvia have not admitted such exemptions, thus affirming the priority of ani-mal welfare over the right to freedom of religion. The Polish constitutional court recentlyoverturned a ban on ritual slaughter.

Indeed, ritual methods ofslaughtering require that animals be slaughtered without having been stunned,thus causing significant pain during their slaughter.3On the one hand, ritual slaughter seems to be unacceptable not only to thoseconcerned with animal rights, who reject any kind of killing of animals, butalso to those with more moderate worries for the welfare of animals, who mightallow the killing of animals but are concerned with their suffering. On the otherhand, ritual slaughter seems to be justified insofar as it is an expression of theright to freedom of religion. Hence, there seems to be a clash between the rightto religious freedom and the widespread concern for animal welfare.In this paper I propose a conditional solution to this clash between values.Before presenting my argument, I want to emphasize that I will not argue forthe overall admissibility of ritual slaughter. My claim will be more limited: Iwill try to see whether ritual slaughter can be made compatible with a generalconcern for animal welfare. In a sense my claim will rest within the boundariesof non-ideal theory, because I will accept most of the current rules and practic-es surrounding the relation between humans and animals. In other words, I willpropose an improvement of the current system of raising animals that does notchallenge its justification.To do this, I will start from the uncontroversial assumption that qua generalprinciples both the right to freedom of religion and the concern for animalwelfare are sound and justified. I will also assume that neither animal welfarenor religious freedom have priority; rather, I will assume that they are on anequal footing. This does not mean that I am subscribing to a form of metaethi-cal pluralism. I will simply take their clash at face value. To argue for the prior-ity of one over the other we would need a complete and substantive theory ofjustice. In this paper my aim is obviously much more modest. Indeed I willonly discuss whether they can be made compatible without arguing for thepriority of one over the other.To understand whether they can be made compatible in the case of ritualslaughter we need to establish what exactly they demand of us. In the light ofthis, I will argue that there is no convincing reason to consider the sufferinginvolved in the killing of animals more important than other types of sufferingthey face during their lives (on farms). If so, to make ritual slaughter compati-ble, at least in principle, with concerns for animal welfare, I will argue that wemight demand that ritually slaughtered animals be “compensated” for their3 Although some people claim that, if the slaughter is performed appropriately, the sufferingof ritually slaughtered animals is not significantly greater than that suffered by animalsfacing standard slaughter methods, for the sake of simplicity I will not call into question thestandard assumption that ritual slaughter involves some significant amount of pain which isgreater than the pain involved in non-ritual slaughter.HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 111more painful death. Such compensation might be made by raising these animalsin better conditions than those who will be stunned before slaughter. I willconclude by defending this proposal against some standard objections andargue it is only convincing if ritual slaughter is really essential to the mainte-nance of religious tradition.2.A Clash of Values?The case of ritual slaughter seems to involve a clash between concerns aboutanimal welfare and those about religious freedom. The right to freedom ofreligion is undoubtedly one of the fundamental liberal rights. Respecting thisright does not consist of the mere protection of a person’s inner sphere of beliefand faith. Rather, it includes a number of more specific rights, such as the rightto gather and pray in public. Among these rights we can include the right to eatand follow the dietary prescriptions of one’s religion. Accordingly, ritualslaughter is an expression of this general right. But there seems to be a case forits limitation. Religious freedom is thought to be inviolable to the extent that itsexercise does not infringe upon other rights and the fundamental interests ofothers. One might say that ritual slaughter is wrong precisely because it in-fringes upon the rights of animals. However, it is not clear whether animalshold rights. The least we can say is that this is a controversial claim and there isa deep disagreement about this issue.4 Irrespective of whether animals holdrights, however, most Western legislation displays a concern for animal welfarethat seems to be related to duties on the part of human beings. However, it isnot clear what justification might ground such a concern. Is it couched on arights-based view or on utilitarian grounds?On the one hand, it certainly cannot be defended on a standard rights-basedview, because current rights-based views do not only demand that we takeanimal welfare and suffering into account; they also argue that animals have aninviolable right to life. On the other hand, one might think that an interest inanimal welfare and suffering is typically utilitarian. However, we might askwhether such a utilitarian view should be applied only to animals or also in otherdomains. But, since utilitarianism is an all-encompassing and monist theory, itcannot only be applied to one domain (viz. animals) and not to other relevantlysimilar domains (namely all sentient beings including human beings). In a word,the principle that Nozick (1974, 41) called “utilitarianism for animals, Kantian-ism for people” cannot be squared with utilitarian monism. Justifying this dis-crimination is not only at odds with utilitarian monism but also with the commit-4 The importance of and the commitment to realizable institutional principles in a politicaltheory of human-animal relations is stressed also in Ahlhaus and Niesen (2015, in this HSRForum).HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 112ment to anti-speciesism held by many utilitarians. Thus, if we want a utilitarianjustification of the treatment of animals, we must also be prepared to accept autilitarian justification in other fields of public ethics. But this would be quiteunpalatable for many of us. Thus, although certain types of utilitarianism couldendorse the idea that we have duties towards animals, this would be at the priceof an endorsement of overall utilitarian principles, which would also requiresignificant changes to current laws and principles. Given the non-ideal premis-es of this paper, the thorough utilitarian option seems unfeasible.There may be other contending moral theories, but it is not clear whichgrounds the current protection of animal welfare. In general, approaches to theprotection of animal welfare can be indirect and direct. An indirect approachwould justify concern for animal welfare through a duty to respect human atti-tudes, beliefs, or commitment towards animals. In indirect approaches animalsare beneficiaries of certain kinds of treatment, but human beings are the ad-dressees of the direct obligations as well as the bearers of moral status. Forinstance, some Italian laws concerning the prohibition of killing of and crueltyto animals (articles 544-bis to 544-sexies of the Penal Code) are grouped in achapter devoted to the “offences against human sensitivity towards animals.”5Direct approaches to the protection of animals, by contrast, ground dutiestowards animals in the interests that animals have autonomously and inde-pendently of human attitudes towards them. An example of this direct approachcan be found in the European Council Regulation on the protection of animalsat the time of killing (1099/2009 of 24 September 2009), which asserts that“animal welfare is a Community value” (preamble 4). The scope of its applica-tion is based not on our relation to animals but on “scientific evidence” demon-strating that “vertebrate animals are sentient beings” (preamble 19).6However, it must be emphasized that there seems to be an ambiguity inmany current legal systems regarding whether the protection of animals isgrounded in direct or indirect duties towards animals.7 Diverse pieces of legis-5 However, there is no coherent application of the indirect approach because such articles, aswell as article 727, which prohibits keeping animals in conditions that are incompatible withtheir nature and that cause great suffering, point also at a direct approach. The reference toanimals’ ethological nature and specific needs is interpreted in the jurisprudence as a clearrecognition of animals’ subjective interest and humans’ corresponding direct duties.6 An even clearer example of the direct approach is the Swiss Federal Law (455, 16 December2005). In art. 1 the law states that the safeguarding of animal dignity is the overall aim ofthe law.7 One prominent case is the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz), which demands that animals beprotected, as should nature, in virtue of the responsibility we have towards future genera-tions (article 20a). Despite the prominence given to animals in legislation at the constitu-tional level, this seems to be an indirect approach in virtue of its being grounded in thewell-being of future generations of human beings. On the contrary, the law on animal pro-tection (Tierschutzgesetz, § 1) demands that human beings should be responsible for ani-HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 113lation take different approaches or can be interpreted in both ways. Such anambiguity may be a legacy of past views that have not been amended, since afull recognition of human direct duties towards animals would demand moreextensive (and unwanted) legal protection of animals. Hence, we cannot saythat all the relevant laws on animal welfare are based on a direct approach. Onthe other hand, if we take the indirect approach seriously, it is difficult to un-derstand what good is protected by laws aiming at animal welfare. Is it onlyhuman sensitivity towards animal suffering that is protected? That is possible.However, this would make it difficult to argue that the suffering of animalsshould be prevented even when no human being would be offended. After all,our sensitivity is not likely to be affected by hidden slaughter houses that donot expose animal suffering to the public.These are very intricate questions that cannot be settled here. In what fol-lows I will discuss only direct approaches toward the protection of animalwelfare.8 This does not mean that we should disregard the indirect elements,and nor does it mean that the conclusion I will draw is not valid for an indirectapproach. It means, rather, that the kinds of reasons we will consider, unlessotherwise specified, will regard the duties – if any exist – that we have directlytowards animals, not the duties we have towards the attitudes and beliefs ofother human beings towards animals. After all, although legal systems andcultural practices are not immune to inconsistencies and ambiguities, a directapproach towards animal welfare seems capable of capturing the widespreadidea that causing unnecessary suffering to a sentient being is intrinsicallywrong. This is why adopting a perspective based on direct duties seems aworthwhile enterprise. One may object that such a direct approach is too mini-mal if it can permit the killing of animals. That may be true. However, as Ihave said, here my aim is not to ask whether the principles underlying currentlegislation on animals are the most convincing. I simply start there in order toask whether and how we may reconcile the duty to care for animals and theright to religious freedom that allows ritual slaughter.As a preliminary remark, we should bear in mind that ritual slaughter wasoriginally intended to cause the quickest and least painful death to animals,according to Jewish and Muslim traditions (Lerner and Rabello 2006/7). Such abelief should not be discarded as mere self-deceit, because this might havebeen the case at the time of its origination, according to the scientificmals qua “fellow creatures” (Mitgeschöpf). And this seems to point at a direct concern foranimals.8 I have provided an alternative account based on an indirect view on the protection ofanimals in Zuolo (2014). Although I think the indirect approach has the advantage of beingmore clearly compatible with a number of admitted practices and with ritual slaughter inparticular, in this paper I assume that the account underlying current laws may be justifiedas a set of direct duties. I cannot establish here which account is more convincing all thingsconsidered.HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 114knowledge and the tools available. The religious grounds of the practice mayhave been that pain minimization was a way to respect the sacred nature of thedivine gift of creation.Hence, we may say that Jewish and Muslim religious traditions have alsobeen committed to the minimization of animal suffering, despite the fact thattheir understanding of this requirement is based upon religious rather thancontemporary scientific ideas. This means that if we take this idea at face val-ue, as the grounding principle of the practice of ritual slaughter, there would,strictly speaking, be no contradiction between religious freedom and animalwelfare – only a clash between two different understandings of the same prin-ciple regarding animal welfare when it is applied to slaughter: one informed bycontemporary practices and science, and the other informed by traditionalreligious techniques.9 This picture, which reinterprets a clash of values as a clashof methods for reducing animal suffering, seems plausible. However, in the end,the reason to consider the traditional practice of ritual slaughter so important isthat it seems to be at the core of Jewish and Muslim communities, touching upona fundamental part of these religions, namely eating10 in a way that is consistentwith one’s most important beliefs. Hence, the clash of values resurfaces again.This qualification is important in order to prevent a further objection. If Jews andMuslims should in principle eat only kosher and halal meat, whose productionseems to be at odds with other legal and moral requirements, why cannot we saythat Jews and Muslims ought to forsake meat eating and become vegetarian?After all, this same choice is made by many people on moral grounds. If thereasons for forbidding non-halal and non-kosher meat are so important, whyshouldn’t believers be willing and committed not to eating meat at all where itdoes not comply with their religious requirements? This is a serious questionbecause we cannot take it for granted that any kind of practice that is typical ofa certain cultural and religious tradition is worthy, per se, of defense and spe-cial treatment. I shall leave discussion of this issue to the final section. Here itsuffices to say that, whatever our response to the question of whether ritualslaughter is fundamental to Jewish and Muslim traditions, we have anotherreason for taking the practice of religious slaughter seriously. This is the rea-sonable presumption that prohibiting halal and kosher meat would cause furtherdisadvantage to Muslims and Jews – two communities that have already suf-fered extensive discrimination. Hence, we might say that whatever our position9 This is at least partially shown by the fact that some Jewish and Muslim theorists claim thatritual killing is still the least painful way of slaughtering because, if the method is properlyperformed, the animal loses consciousness immediately. However, the factual validity of thisclaim is at least doubtful and discussing it would lead us astray.10 I focus only on meat eating, thus leaving aside the problem of the use of leather becauseMuslim and Jewish communities seem to have divergent prescriptions on this, and becausewearing leather clothes does not seem to be an uncontroversially fundamental human need.HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 115on ritual slaughter is, banning it would create further disadvantage (whetherjustified or not) for two communities that already face discrimination.3.What Does a Concern for Animal Welfare Require of Us?This paper, in short, confronts the following question: What is so special aboutslaughter? If we are really concerned with animal welfare, while still admittingthe permissibility of raising and killing animals for the sake of human nourish-ment, why is the way in which they are killed so important? This is not to un-derestimate the suffering involved in ritual slaughter. My point, rather, is toargue that there seems to be a sort of hypocrisy or incoherent attitude regardinganimal suffering. If a concern for animal welfare requires the minimization ofsuffering, why should this minimization of suffering specifically target thekilling of animals, rather than being more extensively applied to the whole lifeof the raised animal? Anticipating a possible objection, one might say that con-cern with animal suffering during slaughter is more feasible and realistic becausethe alternative, namely providing better care during animals’ lives, would be toocostly. Cost is certainly a problem, in that more extensive care for animals duringtheir lives is certainly more costly than simply being concerned about their suffer-ing at the very end of their lives. The former would require us to ban industrialfarming, or at least to raise animals using different methods, leaving them withmore space to move, more possibilities for interaction with other animals, moretime to spend with their offspring, and so on. It seems clear that much more canbe done to promote the welfare of farmed animals. A number of recent studiesshow that farmed animals suffer even when there is no direct evidence of thissuffering (as there is during slaughter) (Aaltola 2012, 1-67). However, if wefocus on the suffering involved in slaughter rather than in an animal’s life simplyon the basis of cost, the normative grounding of our argument is both weak andunclear. The only plausible way to defend the current focus on animal sufferingduring slaughter is to claim that suffering during slaughter is different from –and/or not reducible to – other types of suffering. Such a difference would justifygiving priority to suffering during slaughter, rather than other forms of suffer-ing, and would ground the legal and moral obligation to stun animals. Let ussee what theories in animal ethics have to say about this issue.We could give priority to the suffering caused by slaughter either becausewe consider it to be of greater magnitude or because we have independentreasons to prevent this type of suffering. The former holds true only if we sub-scribe to a position that explains why suffering during slaughter is more weightythan countless other minor types of suffering. If we look at this from a broadlyconsequentialist perspective, it seems difficult to justify, because it either under-estimates how much animals can suffer in industrial farming or overestimateshow seriously we ought to take the pain experienced by animals during the finalHSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 116moments of their lives. Even if we do not subscribe to a thoroughly utilitarianposition, we can nevertheless frame the issue in terms of a measure of badness.All sufferings derive from an aversive state or stimulus (pain, fear, anxiety,discomfort) that should be assessed with respect to two fundamental dimen-sions: intensity and duration.11 We may think that the suffering caused byslaughter is far more intense than other kinds of suffering, but its duration iscertainly shorter than others, which are typically repeated many times. Unlesswe take intensity more seriously than duration, which we have no obviousreason to do, the two dimensions seem to be equally important in a determina-tion of the respective amount of suffering. Hence, the suffering involved inslaughter should be weighted through these two dimensions in the same way asother types of suffering. And if so, it seems hard to justify the idea that thesuffering involved in slaughter has any kind of priority over that involved inother parts of an animal’s life.The alternative to placing more importance on the suffering caused byslaughter is to see the types of activities involved in ritual slaughter (and inother types of slaughter without stunning) as wrong in themselves, irrespectiveof whether the suffering involved during slaughter is quantitatively greater thanthat experienced in industrial farming. On this view, it is the very mode ofkilling without stunning that gives us a reason to forbid such an action. Thiscan be done either by adopting a virtue-based account or a Kantian view. First,on a virtue-based account, it is intrinsically wrong to kill an animal without stun-ning it insofar as this is a form of cruelty, which is per se intrinsically wrong. Butthis claim seems to bear the burden of proof in showing why ritual slaughter isintrinsically wrong while standard slaughter is not. To prove that it is intrinsicallywrong, we should consider only the intrinsic features of the act of killing irre-spective of the type of consequences it involves. To do this, we have to show thatritual killing is necessarily motivated by a vicious intention and/or that it neces-sarily fosters vicious traits of character. But this seems particularly difficult toshow if we consider, as seen above, that ritual slaughter was introduced in thebeginning as a way of minimizing animal suffering. This means that the stand-ard religious motivation for ritual slaughter may not stem from a desire to becruel but rather from a desire to minimize animal suffering. Hence, there seemsto be no cruel motivation involved in, and a virtue-based account would haveno reason to reject the practice.The second way in which this perspective may be justified is the Kantianview. As we know, according to Kant (1997), causing unnecessary pain toanimals is wrong, not in virtue of their direct interest in not suffering, but be-cause cruel actions disrespect our humanity and are conducive to the develop-ment of a cruel attitude towards other human beings. To assess this alternative,11 As is well-known, the origin of this approach to measuring value (and disvalue) dates backto Bentham (1996, ch. 4). For a more recent version see Rowan (2012, 210).HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 117let us put aside the fact that we are considering only justifications for animalwelfare based on direct duties towards animals, and that this concern for thedevelopment of wrongful and vicious attitudes seems at odds with the overalllegal principle that laws should be concerned with behaviors, not intentions.First, the idea that (ritual) slaughtering is more conducive to developing viciousattitudes and behaviors is factually dubious. If this were the case, one mightalso argue that people who perform slaughter according to the ritual method orwitness such slaughter are more likely to be cruel towards other human beings.But there does not seem to be any evidence supporting this claim. And theburden of proof is borne by those who make it. Moreover, besides the dubiousfactual reliability of this statement, it also has an unpalatable moral implication.Indeed, it would amount to saying that in Jewish and Muslim communitiespeople are more likely to have cruel attitudes than in other religious communi-ties. But this claim is disrespectful, to say the least.There are other possible reasons for giving more weight to the suffering in-volved in the killing of an animal rather than that experienced in the animal’slife. Let us review them in brief. First, recall that in general animal rights viewscannot uphold this point because they wholeheartedly reject the idea that thelife of an animal is at human disposal (Regan 1983; Francione 2008; Don-aldson and Kymlicka 2011). An animal’s right to life forbids the kind of prin-ciple we are discussing here.12A further possibility is to take a relational approach. Under the umbrella of“relational approaches” I include diverse theories: feminist care-based ap-proaches (Noddings 1984; Donovan 1999), associative accounts (Valentini2014), and pluralist positions (Anderson 2004; Scruton 2000). Needless to saythis is a very sketchy categorization. These theories differ in many relevantrespects, but for the purposes of this paper they can safely be discussed togeth-er. Indeed, all these theories share the idea that, unlike utilitarianism and ani-mal rights theories, the moral treatment we owe to animals cannot be estab-lished a priori only on the basis of a natural property that animals have (meresentience in utilitarianism, or the capacity of being the subject-of-a-life forRegan). Indeed, the treatment we owe to animals depends on the type of rela-tions we have with them.These approaches do not provide a univocal normative response to our prob-lem. Some do not accept the killing of animals at all. Others hold that it is notin principle wrong to kill animals provided that it is done in the proper way.13However, it would seem odd to include among admissible methods, that is,12 Perhaps it is not in principle impossible to outline a rights-based approach that does notnecessarily include a right to life. However, this possibility is not considered by current pro-ponents of standard rights-based views.13 On this remark see Donovan (1999), who supports feminist vegetarianism, and PaxtonGeorge (1994), who argues against this duty, also on feminist grounds.HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 118among those that are more respectful of animal nature and the expression ofcare towards them, those that involve more suffering. Moreover, caring morefor an animal’s death than for an animal’s life would be utterly inconsistentwith the ideas grounding care-based theories.Hence, upon reviewing consequentialist, virtue-based, Kantian, rights-based,and care-based views, there seems to be no defensible argument for givingpriority to the suffering involved in slaughter rather than in the life of a raisedanimal. The only remaining view that could justify giving priority to the suffer-ing involved in slaughter would have to prioritize the final condition of anindividual’s life, giving it a special if not fundamental significance, perhapsbecause the very final moments in an individual life constitute the truth ofone’s life. However, this view is deeply suspicious because it seems to dependon religious and theological presuppositions that are controversial in them-selves, and even more dubious when applied to animals. It seems more plausi-ble, in sum, to suppose that if we are concerned with the suffering of animals,we ought to estimate their suffering based on magnitude and frequency throughthe whole of a life, without giving priority to its end. After all, giving priorityto the moment of death seems unwarranted and even based upon an anthropo-centric bias. Accordingly, if we were to calculate the pains and sufferings in thelife of an animal that had been raised using standard methods on a typical in-dustrial farm, it would almost certainly turn out that the suffering and paininduced would outweigh the pain and suffering caused by ritual slaughter.4.Suffering, Stunning, and Non-DiscriminationBuilding on this, I want to argue that there is a flaw both in legislation prohibit-ing ritual slaughter and in that allowing it. First, prohibiting ritual slaughterdoes not seem fully justified because, as seen, there is nothing special about thepain inflicted during death in relation to the pain experienced by an animalduring its life. Second, allowing ritual slaughter might discriminate againstritually slaughtered animals. This is so because both ritually slaughtered andnon-ritually slaughtered animals are raised in the same conditions (typically onindustrial farms), but the former experience the pain of ritual slaughter. While,as seen, there is nothing special about this pain, the amount of suffering in-volved tilts the balance of suffering in a way that is, quantitatively, unfair toritually slaughtered animals. Indeed, it seems fair to say that, whatever theassessment of death to which one subscribes, ritually slaughtered animals suf-fer more than non-ritually slaughtered animals. Hence, we seem to discriminateagainst ritually slaughtered animals. And, if we ought to be concerned with thesuffering of animals because suffering is intrinsically wrong, and in virtue ofthe fact that we have some direct duties to animals, this discriminatory treat-ment is unjustified.HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 119At this point, we may wonder why we should be concerned with the principleof non-discrimination between types of animals if we are ready to kill them.14After all, non-discrimination might derive from the principle of equal treatment,and theories that invoke the principle of equal treatment of animals, whether inthe form of equal status for individuals or the principle of equal consideration ofinterests, would not allow the killing and exploitation of animals for the purposeof human nourishment.15 Put this way, the idea of equality or non-discriminationseems to be either misplaced or the kind of concern that should be taken intoaccount only after considering a more fundamental normative principle, that is,respect for animal life and the minimization of animal suffering. Furthermore,one may think that the broad welfarist position discussed here resembles utilitari-anism in certain respects. And, as we have seen, utilitarianism is not committed tonon-discrimination per se, unless it can be demonstrated to be conducive to agreater aggregate well-being. Indeed, one may say that in a version of act utilitar-ianism that is not committed to Singer’s inter-specific egalitarianism of interests,my worry regarding non-discrimination would not be warranted. After all, onsuch a view, discriminating against the interests of a class of human or non-human individuals might in principle be justified if such discrimination wouldbring about a better aggregate outcome for all.16 In sum, it is not clear that we canjustify the duty not to discriminate between types of animals if we do not accept aproper form of egalitarianism for animals.While these objections are interesting, I submit that there are reasons fortaking the non-discrimination of animals seriously even from the welfaristperspective discussed here. This can be proved without making reference to theegalitarian principles embraced by some rights-based theories. The advantageof this strategy is that the resulting argument will be more acceptable from anumber of perspectives, including those that are at odds with inter-specific egali-tarianism. To prove this, I will proceed, first, by advancing a positive argument infavor of my proposal and, second, by calling the tenability of the alternative viewinto question. In other words, I will first sketch the idea that a direct-duty per-spective implicitly commits us to the principle of non-discrimination. Second, Iwill argue that the alternative, namely of discriminating between ritually and non-ritually slaughtered animals, has a bigger burden of proof and that the reasonsavailable to ground such a discrimination are unconvincing.14 I am grateful to Peter Niesen and Svenja Ahlhaus for pressing me to respond to this question.15 For the former category, see Regan (1983) and Francione (2008), for the latter, see Singer(1993).16 If so, however, it is not clear how such a non-egalitarian act utilitarianism could justify thediscriminatory treatment of ritually slaughtered animals with respect to non-rituallyslaughtered ones. Certainly, this measure is more beneficial to the non-ritually slaughteredanimals, but it would be preferable to benefit both categories provided that such equaltreatment is not disadvantageous in other respects. In sum, this discrimination is sub-optimal on utilitarian grounds.HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 120We should recall that here I am discussing views endorsing a direct obliga-tion toward animal welfare. There are diverse ways to ground an obligationtowards animal welfare. Whatever we think regarding the alleged animal rightto life, respect for animal welfare might be grounded in the idea that we oughtto respect animals’ sentience and natural dispositions. This holds true in gen-eral, irrespective of whether we subscribe to a rights-based approach, utilitari-anism, feminism, or welfarism. As I stated at the beginning of this paper, I donot defend any of these views. Instead, I am interested in understanding theimplications of a direct approach towards animal welfare for the issue of ritualslaughter. I simply assume that any of these views could reasonably be defend-ed. What all of these views, and others, have in common is the idea that if weowe a direct duty to an individual, that individual is supposed to have a featurejustifying our direct duties. In other words, the individual is recognized ashaving an autonomous interest in not being harmed or in being benefited. Thisobviously puts direct views in opposition to indirect views, according to which– for instance, in the Kantian version – we ought not to cause unnecessarysuffering to a being because we ought to respect humanity (not “animality”).This is to say that whatever theory we adopt in support of direct duties to ani-mals, by adopting a direct view we implicitly assume that the individuals towhom we owe such duties have subjective interests that merit consideration intheir own right and not (only) in virtue of other kinds of considerations, wheth-er indirect or instrumental. In virtue of this feature of owing something to abeing that subjectively merits such a duty, it would be strange to assume thatother typical general meta-normative principles do not apply. If we assume, aswe do here, that we have direct duties towards animals and a responsibility tomaintain animal welfare, it would seem odd if we did not apply the principle ofnon-discrimination toward the beings meriting our direct duties. The oppositeclaim would certainly bear a bigger burden of proof. The burden is to explainwhy we should treat some categories of animals differently.To justify such a discrimination, it is worth remarking that in direct views abeing is entitled to certain treatment in virtue of its intrinsic features, not invirtue of the dispositions regarding animals that the person who is under thatduty possesses. As such, we must ask what distinguishes ritually slaughteredanimals from non-ritually slaughtered animals, and whether such a difference issufficient to justify this discrimination. The only reason for this discriminationis that animals are slaughtered ritually to respect the religious identity of Mus-lims and Jews. However, there are two considerations that weaken this point innormative terms. First, we may say that what distinguishes ritually slaughteredanimals from non-ritually slaughtered animals is not an intrinsic feature ofthose animals, because they are ritually slaughtered only in virtue of the inde-pendent choice of a human being. There is no intrinsic and specific feature ofanimals that individually or collectively determines the fact that they meritsuch slaughter and that might provide a reason for grounding this discrimina-HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 121tion. Second, the normative reason for this discrimination is respect for theright to religious freedom of Jews and Muslims. However, what this right de-mands of us is not to discriminate a category of animals with respect to anothercategory; rather, it simply demands that such a right be respected. That certainanimals are discriminated against because of this religious need is an unfortu-nate, but by no means necessary, consequence of the fact that there are differentreligious doctrines and techniques for slaughtering animals. This means that thereligious difference is not a reason to discriminate against a category of animalswhen there are alternatives available (and we will see in the next section whatthe alternative is), because Jewish and Muslim practices do not demand thatritually slaughtered animals suffer more than other animals. On the contrary, aswe have seen, ritual slaughter was probably devised as a practice for minimiz-ing animal suffering according to the technological knowledge of the age inwhich the practice was adopted.17Now we can respond to the non-egalitarian utilitarian objection raisedabove. Although it is true that the welfarist approach I propose here would notbe vindicated by this form of utilitarianism, it is not clear in our case how such anon-egalitarian act utilitarianism could justify the unequal treatment of rituallyslaughtered animals with respect to non-ritually slaughtered ones. Certainly, thismeasure is more beneficial to the non-ritually slaughtered animals, but it wouldbe preferable to benefit both categories provided that the equal treatment is notdisadvantageous in other respects. And the only way to argue against this non-discrimination would be to point at the major costs incurred in granting bettertreatment to ritually slaughtered animals. Although this is certainly a seriousargument, it is doubtful that even from this perspective the mere matter of costswould outweigh the interests of ritually slaughtered animals in suffering less.Hence, in virtue of the implicit commitment to non-discrimination of the di-rect view and the lack of justification for discrimination, there seems no reasonnot to uphold the principle of non-discrimination when it comes to animals, atleast with respect to their overall welfare and suffering.5.A Possible Solution and a Modest, Though Provocative,ProposalTo remedy the discrimination suffered by ritually slaughtered animals, one mayargue that we ought to abandon ritual slaughter altogether. This is one plausiblesolution. But the more radical solution of banning the raising and killing of17 The same holds true at the legal level. In other words, even if the argument I propose herewas not a morally conclusive argument, it would be strange in a legal sense to treat ritually-and non-ritually slaughtered animals differently.HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 122animals seems to result from the same premises. However, if we want to makesense of current legislation and if we take the right to freedom of religiousexpression seriously, perhaps we can devise another way out of this unsettlingsituation.If we are concerned with animal welfare, but consider the killing of animalsacceptable, and if we want to respect the right to religious freedom, but areworried about discriminating between ritually slaughtered and non-rituallyslaughtered animals, perhaps we could demand that the two categories of ani-mal are given equal prospects of sufficiently high well-being in terms of theamount of pain suffered throughout their whole lives. This means that we eitherforbid ritual slaughter – but hold independent reasons for admitting it –, or wedemand that ritually slaughtered animals be treated better during their lives thanthose that are not ritually slaughtered, so as to compensate for the pain they sufferat the point of death. How this compensation should be realized depends on sometechnical issues and on the relative costs, which I cannot discuss here. Moreover,it depends on an estimation of an animal’s prospects of suffering, which seemvery difficult to calculate individually and comparatively.18 Despite problemswith putting this idea into practice, doing so would certainly be feasible withrelatively minor changes to current methods of animal farming. To give an ex-ample and a thumbnail criterion, it might be that ritually slaughtered animalsought to be raised in larger pens or enjoy more freedom to roam.Needless to say, the justification of this proposal depends on the suppositionthat ritual slaughter is a necessary component of religious freedom and that wecannot simply tell Muslims and Jews not to eat meat. In other words, this solu-tion is acceptable only if ritual slaughter is necessary for the religious identityof Jews and Muslims and if we are committed to an equal recognition of reli-gious identities. If this condition does not obtain, we may simply require Mus-lims and Jews to abandon the practice of ritual slaughter.To meet this condition, it must be shown that religious identity and the in-tegrity of believers would be violated if ritual slaughter were banned. But thisclaim has to be justified, because religiously informed practices, as well asother cultural practices, can change, and it is notoriously difficult and contro-versial to distinguish between features of a cultural tradition that are essentialto it and other features whose suppression or change would not endanger itscontinuation. Here I cannot discuss whether ritual slaughter is necessary for theintegrity and existence of Jewish and Muslim communities. Suffice it to saythat Muslim and Jewish communities bear at least a minimal burden of proof todemonstrate this, in virtue of the fact that some Muslim communities seem to18 Although they concern the case of research on animals, the considerations provided by Bass(2012, 93-6), pointing out the structural indeterminacy of such comparisons of utility func-tions between humans and animals and among animals themselves, seem applicable hereand very convincing.HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 123accept the religious validity of the requirement to stun animals before slaugh-ter.19 This means that the overall permissibility of religious slaughter is subjectto an important condition, irrespective of whether we approve the idea of com-pensating ritually slaughtered animals that I put forward. This conditionalqualification is important because it shows that the expression of religiousfreedom needs to be balanced with other values too.If we apply the principle of non-discrimination to animals and we overcomethe unjustified assumption that the method of killing is more important than themethod of raising animals, many objections to ritual slaughter may be lessenedor put aside. This is particularly the case for Paula Casal’s argument rejectingthe admissibility of exemptions from the ban on cruelty to animals on thegrounds of cultural and religious practices. Casal’s starting assumption is asfollows:I shall avoid reliance on any extravagant assumptions concerning the moral sta-tus of animals, nor shall I argue that animals have rights or that their suffering isof equal moral importance to ours. […] I merely rely upon the modest assump-tion, widely accepted by Western governments and citizens, that the existence ofanti-cruelty legislation is desirable. Such laws are not based on sectarian views,but on the reasonable grounds that it is wrong to kill animals in painful wayswhen alternative less painful methods are available, and that there are soundmoral reasons to enforce such a prohibition (Casal 2003, 2).In general, Casal contends that there is no sufficiently weighty or importantinterest that is capable of justifying cruelty to animals, even a need to protectcertain cultural practices. I do not want to reject her substantive claim, whichmight of course be true. In general, however, it seems to me that her argumentwould be at least displaced, if not rebutted, if ritually slaughtered animals weretreated better than non-ritually slaughtered animals, thus being compensated forthe extra suffering involved during their slaughter. In this way, a standard cri-tique leveled against claims for cultural accommodation and differential treat-ment would be neutralized. Indeed, one of the most troubling objections toculturally-based differential treatment is that the beneficiaries of an exemptionor a special treatment seem to be advantaged with respect to those who arecompelled to abide by standard legal requirements.20 But, if animals sufferingmore during slaughter are compensated, and no overall deviation from thegeneral concern for animal suffering is involved, the idea that ritual slaughterentails a special treatment disappears. Thus, if ritually slaughtered animals are19 This is the case in Malaysia. See Department of Islamic Development Malaysia. 2011.

Its justification is deeply conditional on its necessityfor religious identities and on our commitment to the protection of religiousfreedom. My aim in this paper, rather, was to show that it is possible to recon-cile a concern for animal welfare and the right to freedom of religious expres-sion by compensating the pain caused to ritually slaughtered animals withbetter conditions during their lives. The advantage of this solution is that itemploys a principle of fairness towards animals as well as towards humanbeings. It applies a principle of fairness to animals themselves because it com-pensates the discrimination imposed by ritual slaughter. And it is also fair withrespect to human beings because it does not simply concede an exemption froma general principle to two religious communities, but it also demands that theytreat the ritually slaughtered animals better, without asking them to changetheir religious practice. Hence, such a solution seems to address the problemsfaced by contemporary societies regarding the difficult accommodation ofminority claims in an environment of pluralistic values. This solution mayseem too biased, to some people, towards the status quo regarding the overalltreatment of animals, but it has the advantage of proposing a very feasibleimprovement of the life of many animals.21 Claiming this, however, does not imply that we should also accept other cultural practicessuch as Santeria rituals or bullfights, which Casal mentions.HSR 40 (2015) 4 │ 125References<ref>Aaltola, Elisa. 2012.
