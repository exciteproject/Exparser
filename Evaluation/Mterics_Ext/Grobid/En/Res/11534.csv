The degree of correspondence in the mediasystem is discussed against the background of Germanýs pluralistic media structure on theone hand and concepts of public opinion on the other hand. Rather than investigating thedifferential issue selection among the newspapers the analysis compares the opinions onissues correspondingly addressed by several newspapers. It focuses on the newspapers´positions regarding fundamental political conflicts and identifies spheres of consensus andconflict in the media system. Although the newspapers represent distinctly differentpolitical orientations each of them also showed issue-specific deviations from its generalpreference for left or right policy alternatives. Results indicate considerable degrees ofconsonance regarding external relations issues and education policy. Conflict evolvedaround law and order and migration issues.ZusammenfassungDas Papier untersucht das Ausmaß von Konflikt und Konsonanz in den Kommentaren derfünf Deutschen Qualitätszeitungen zwischen 1994 und 1998. Der Grad der Übereinstim-mungen wird vor dem Hintergrund der pluralistischen Struktur des Mediensystems einer-seits und Ansätzen zur öffentlichen Meinungsbildung andererseits diskutiert. Nicht diezeitungsspezifisch unterschiedliche Themenauswahl, sondern die unterschiedlichen Mei-nungen, die zu einem von mehreren Zeitungen gleichzeitig ins Spiel gebrachten Themavertreten werden, stehen im Mittelpunkt des Interesses. Die Analyse vergleicht die Positio-nen, die die Zeitungen zu politischen Grundkonflikten vertreten, und bestimmt Sphären desKonsenses und des Konflikts im Mediensystem. Trotz der unterschiedlichen politischenGrundorientierungen der Zeitungen zeigten sich bei bestimmten Themen jeweils auch Ab-weichungen der Zeitungen von ihrer generellen Präferenz für linke oder rechte Politikal-ternativen. Es ergab sich ein beträchtliches Ausmaß an Konsonanz für Themen aus demBereich der internationalen Beziehungen sowie für die Bildungspolitik. Konfliktreicherverlief dagegen der mediale Diskurs zur Rechts- und Ordnungspolitik sowie zu Fragen derMigration.Christiane EildersConflict and Consonance in Media Opinion:Political Positions of five German Quality Newspapers1. Introduction1The dissemination of information is an undisputed function of the mass media in modernsocieties. Where a face-to-face exchange of information between all segments of society hasbecome impossible, the mass media mediate information between the audience and thepolitical actors and thus constitute one of the most important subsystems of society. Yet,media in this perspective are frequently attributed a predominantly passive role as they areseen to provide a forum for the exchange of information between a variety of actors withoutcontributing their own view. Restricting the role of the media to their primary function ofinformation dissemination is not only a deficient description of the media but also meansdistorting and underestimating the legitimate active role of the media in the process ofopinion formation. Recent contributions on media performance in modern democracieshave drawn attention to the more persuasive and evaluative functions of the media(Gurevitch/Blumler 1990, Page 1996a).The increase in research activity under the heading of „framing“ is a good illustration ofthe shift towards the persuasive and evaluative dimensions of mass communication. After aperiod of concentration on the information function of media and cognitive effects scholarshave rediscovered attitudes and opinions2. Re-introducing opinion as relevant factor incommunication research not only implies a broader perspective on media effects in theaudience, it should also modify and differentiate our conceptualization of the mediathemselves. A systematic incorporation of persuasive and evaluative dimensions directsattention to the media’s political positions and the ways these are communicated. Thispaper takes the perspective of media as political actors with genuine interests and goalstrying to find resonance for their opinions in the audience and the political system. Mediado not only act as neutral information agencies providing a forum for other actors but takean active role in the political process by selecting and structuring information, interpreting1 This paper is a slightly revised version of a paper presented at the Annual Conference of the InternationalCommunication Association in Washington D.C. in May 2001. It is part of a larger research project (“DieStimme der Medien im politischen Prozess: Themen und Meinungen in Pressekommentaren”) funded bythe Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG). It was conducted by Friedhelm Neidhardt, Barbara Pfetschand the autor at the Social Science Center Berlin.2 Also see the discussion on second-level agenda stetting which strongly emphasizes the links betweenissues and opinions (Ghanem 1997).2and evaluating the stream of events continuously taking place and supporting or rejectingparticular policy options (Page 1996b, Jarren 1996).Mediás political positions are most openly and legitimately expressed in the opinionsections. Through editorials the media publicly express their opinions and make use of theirright to present themselves as autonomous actors. In editorials rather than in the news sectionthe different media outlets establish a particular ideological profile that makes themdistinguishable from their competitors and binds certain segments of the audience. Byfocusing on editorials this paper investigates the particular political positions of the Germanquality press without regarding its performance in disseminating information. Rather thanconceptionalizing the media as collective actor with a uniform political position, the papersets out to examine the particular constellations of opinion in the media system.Considering the pluralistic structure of the German media system and the distribution ofthe newspapers across the entire range of the political spectrum there should be aconsiderable degree of conflict between papers with opposite political positions anddivergent party allegiances. Yet, many scholars assume a high level of consonance inmedia discourse resulting from corresponding professional routines, the homogeneity ofclass interests, and journalistic co-orientation. The paper discusses the conditions andconsequences of consonance and conflict in the media system and relate these to the ideaof pluralism and on the one hand and concepts assuming high degrees of consonance inpublic opinion on the other hand. Applying the position model of party competition to themedia system it is investigated to what extent newspapers differ in terms of their particularpolitical positions on particular issues and where spheres of consensus nevertheless develop.The empirical data presented in this paper is derived from a larger project on editorialdiscourse in the German quality press currently conducted at the Social Science CenterBerlin3.2. Diversity vs. ConsonanceIn modern democracies the mass media maintain and structure the constant exchange ofissues and opinions between different actors. Understanding media functions as desirableoutputs of subsystems for the greater entity, information, critical observation andorientation are the primary democratic functions the media are expected to fulfil. Theneutral dissemination of information between the political elite and the citizensundoubtedly represents the most obvious media function. It has evoked large amounts ofresearch whereas the other media functions have received comparably little attention. Thewatchdog metaphor refers to the mediás assignment of critically observing the politicalprocess and ensuring a certain degree of accountability regarding the political actors. The3 See Neidhardt/Eilders/Pfetsch (1998) and Eilders/Lüter (1998).3critical observation builds on the information function and applies the idea of freedom ofinformation to the relation between the individual and the state. In order to serve aswatchdogs of the political process the media have to be independent of the incumbentauthorities. In Germany – like in most modern democracies – effective and collectivelybinding criticism is assumed to be guaranteed through the structural diversity of the mediasystem. In the print sector and in the privately owned electronic media (as opposed to thepublic broadcasting system) the idea of pluralism depicts the inter-media-diversity ratherthan the intra-media-diversity. The individual media outlet is not expected to present abalanced opinion.Orientation representing the last of the three primary democratic media functions hasbeen widely neglected in the scholarly discourse on media performance (Voltmer 1998/99,14). It explicitly relates to interpretive, evaluative and possibly persuasive media content.The media support the process of opinion formation by critically discussing arguments andmaking judgements regarding particular policy options, actors´ performances and politicaldecisions. Considering the ever increasing amounts of unconnected information suppliedby the media interpretations and evaluative statements that “make some sense” out of thosefragments and thereby provide orientation for the audience gain special significance. Sinceeditorials provide „biased information“ they comply with peoplés need for orientation(Weaver 1977) and enable the audience to make political judgements on the basis oflimited rationality (Calvert 1985). Hackett suggests to substitute the term “bias” by„structured orientation“ (Hackett 1984, 254). One way of reducing the cognitive effort inopinion formation is relating onés own opinion to the political positions of certain eliteswho are assumed to have similar attitudes and opinions (Zaller 1992). German qualitynewspapers also seem to be suited for serving as orientation marks for the opinionformation of the audience because they stand for certain political positions and theirreaders are divided accordingly4.Like the mediás functions of information and critical observation the orientationfunction relies on the pluralistic structure of the media system. It is assumed that as long asa pluralistic media structure is guaranteed the media will provide a wide range of facts andopinions needed for independent opinion formation. Only if the media is open towards thevariety of societal voices, it can disseminate unbiased, comprehensive and completeinformation. Only if the media is independent of state, party or economic influence it isable to act as a watchdog supervising the political process. And only if it represents avariety of opinions, it can provide sufficient orientation for the audience and support theaudiencés opinion formation. Thus, pluralism may be regarded as the normative basis fora well-functioning democratic media system.4 See the findings of the “Allensbacher Werbeträger-Analyse” 1995, where the prestige press audience inGermany is broken down into their political orientation (Schulz 1997, 104).4Taking a macro-level perspective on media content means we are not interested insingle editorials but in the universe of issues and opinions in the media system. Mostinvestigations of media opinion conceptionalize media as uniform collective actor withoutdifferentiating between individual outlets with opposite political positions and divergentparty allegiances. Yet, the plurality of voices in the media system has to be considered andspecial attention has to be directed to the particular constellations of correspondence anddivergence among different media outlets. The structural pluralism in the German mediasystem provides for a certain degree of political conflict in the media system. It can beexpected that media outlets with a liberal editorial stance hold different opinions than theirmore conservative counterparts. The differences between media outlets are likely to followparty lines considering that „the same social forces that find expression in the party orparties of a political system tend to find expression also through the press“ (Seymoure-Ure1974, 159). This leads not only to a parallelism between certain papers and parties but alsoimplies a correspondence between the range of papers and the range of parties.In Germany, the press-party-parallelism is rooted in the tradition of party journalism.Although there is no relevant paper with institutional links to a particular party any more,the party structure is still reflected in today’s press system, especially in the opinion-leading national quality newspapers. Several empirical studies show that German nationalquality newspapers cover almost the entire political spectrum with the Welt located at theright and the Tageszeitung (taz) at the left of the continuum. Between these poles,beginning from the right and proceeding to the left, there are the Frankfurter Allgemeine(FAZ), the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (FR) (Kepplinger1985, Hagen 1992, Schönbach 1977, Donsbach/Wolling/Blomberg 1996).In any pluralistic media system different media outlets compete against each other bydeveloping a distinct content profile in order to position and stabilize themselves in theaudience market and become distinguishable from other media outlets. Therefore, weexpect considerable differences in the ideological positions of the different newspapers.Some structural characteristics of media systems, however, seem to suggest the opposite: thecorresponding standardized attention criteria and interpretation strategies, the uniformity ofprofessional and class interests, the media’s observation of each other and their reciprocal co-orientation are likely to produce high levels of correspondence in the media system (Noelle-Neumann 1973, Noelle-Neumann/Mathes 1987, Jarren 1988). In communication researchthe actual degree of diversity is strongly debated. This also regards the desirable amount ofcommonality in a modern society. Whereas a pluralistic media structure and high degreesof content diversity has persistently been unquestioned as a presupposition of free opinionformation and a well functioning democracy, recent developments like individualizationand the fragmentation of the audience have nurtured the fear of an increasing societaldesintegration and lead to a more critical discussion of diversity in the media system. Itdoes not need to be emphasized that a total uniformity between the issues and opinions in5the media is as dysfunctional as the total lack of mutuality5 (Schulz 1999, Holtz-Bacha1997).From the perspective of mediás contribution to societal integration high degrees ofmedia correspondence will receive positive evaluations as they give evidence of aminimum degree of common focus in the audience. Integration, however, is not the onlyoutcome of political communication processes requiring high degrees of correspondence.Uniformity in the media system is also appreciated if it seems appropriate to put pressureon the political system to process an issue or react to a particular concern of the public.Media opinion can then be regarded as a substitute of public opinion which becomes aconsistent, politically effective and sociologically relevant factor only as a high level ofcorrespondence develops. The concept of public opinion thus more or less explicitlyincludes the notion of consonance (Gerhards/Neidhardt 1991, Neidhardt 1994, Noelle-Neumann 1982). This point is well illustrated in the spiral-of-silence-approach and relatedconcepts referring to undesirable effects of public opinion.Noelle-Neumann´s concept of the spiral of silence is built on the assumption that highlyconsonant media content is perceived as majority opinion. This perception generatessufficient social pressure for individuals not to dare expressing divergent opinions inpublic. As a consequence the impression of the dominant opinion is reinforced and a spiralof silence develops marginalizing opinions that are not sufficiently represented in themedia (Noelle-Neumann 1982). She sees the corresponding attention criteria, the politicaluniformity of the professional peer group, the media’s reciprocal co-orientation as mainreasons for the highly consonant media messages. The mainstreaming approach developedby Gerbner and his team (Gerbner/Gross 1976; Gerbner et al.1980, 1992, 1984) is based onvery similar assumptions. According to this approach high degrees of consonance in themedia establish social norms that more and more individuals adapt to by changing theiroriginal attitudes and opinions into the “mainstream” opinion. Gerbner and his team seetelevision as the main unifying factor in modern societies producing high degrees ofconformity in peoplés images of the world. The orientation towards large audiences andthe elite domination of the media are seen as the main reasons for consonant mediacontent. The dominant tendency is not the aggregate of all the different opinions in society:„Rather, it is the most general, functional and stable mainstream, representing the broadestdimensions of shared meanings and assumptions (...) this mainstream can be thought of asa relative commonality of outlooks and values that heavy exposure to the television world5 The antagonism between pluralism or diversity and integration is vividly reflected by the contrastingappraisals of any given degree of correspondence in the media system. Depending on the particularreference point high degrees of correspondence are characterized using either positive synonyms likeconsent, cultural mutuality and harmony or negative synonyms like conformity, adaption, assimilation,uniformity, standardization, stereotyping, collectivism, monopolization, and monologization. Lowdegrees of correspondences are either positively labelled as diversity and pluralism or devalued asfragmentation, heterogenization, segmentation, dissipation, atomization, specialization, individualization,and polarization (Knoche 1985).6tends to cultivate“ (Gerbner et al. 1994, 286). Both approaches – even though developedwith opposite political backgrounds and holding different explanations for the assumedcontent conformity - view high degrees of consonance in the media as threat to thepluralistic ideal of opinion diversity and as a obstacle to social change.3. Issues vs. positionsPluralism and press-party-parallelism on the one hand and the assumption of highlyuniform media content on the other hand lead to conflicting expectations regarding thedegree of correspondence in the media system. In spite of the controversial debates aresearch tradition investigating the actual degree of consonance in the media has notdeveloped. The empirical efforts to assess the common issue repertoires and opinions inthe media system remained few. Except for single-issue comparisons across differentmedia-outlets7 there is basically no information on the general degree of correspondence inthe media system.Apart from those empirical shortcomings a theoretical deficit can also be observed.There is no differentiation between issues and opinions issues. In media research highdegrees of correspondence are predominantly referred to as consonance. Consonanceincludes both correspondences of issues and opinions. A terminological differentiation issuggested in order to sharpen the analytical understanding of the construct. Consonancewill be used for the evaluative dimension. The degree of correspondence on the issuedimension will be referred to as focusing. Thus, focusing denotes a correspondence ofissues, whereas consonance relates to a correspondence of opinion. Regarding theformation of public opinion it is assumed that a low degree of focusing implies afragmentation of public opinion with highly dissipated issue agendas, whereas a lack ofconsonance points to considerable conflict between different segments of society. Thepartisanship might follow the established structures of the party spectrum or develop alongthe groups and movements not represented in the party system. Correspondingly, the lineof conflict can be located between media with left and right party allegiances, or betweenthe media, the political groups and movements on the one hand and the establishedpolitical parties on the other hand. This would be the case if the positions in the media6 The mainstreaming approach points to older Gramsci-inspired theories in the context of ideologicalhegemony which see a unifying effect as a result from elite domination of the media. They structure theideological field, absorb and domesticate criticism. „Discrepant statements about reality areacknowledged – but muffled, softened, blurred, fragmented, domesticated at the same time“ (Gitlin 1980,270; also see Hallin 1987).7 Frequent subjects of analysis are elections and scandals (summary in Kepplinger 1995), but there are alsosome comprehensive and detailed comparisons between media outlets regarding other issues (Kepplinger,1989; Kepplinger/Donsbach/Brosius/Staab, 1986; Knoche/Lindgens 1988; Reiser 1994; Schönbach 1977;Voltmer 1997; Weiß 1985, 1986, 1988).7system develop regardless of party allegiances - for example in terms of new conflictsbetween materialism and post-materialism (Fuchs 1991).The differentiation between issues and opinions can be related to two researchparadigms, one focusing on the issue dimension, the other one addressing the question ofcorresponding opinion. The salience model considers issue selection to be the mostimportant aspect of party competition. In this view, it might have a larger impact on thepublic’s perception of an actor’s ideological position whether or not environmental policyis addressed by a political actor than his or her particular position on concrete policyoptions. In the salience model the assignment of relevance to an issue is debated in thecontext of political parties´ strategy to establish an ideological profile and positionthemselves in relation to competing parties. Scholars supporting the salience model holdthat parties do not compete via different positions regarding the same issues. Rather, theyselectively emphasize certain issues, presenting them as the most relevant problems on thepolitical agenda. “Left-right competition can consist of attempts to assert the salience ofdifferent issues that favor one or the other side” (Budge/Farlie 1985, 288). Applied to themedia system, the salience model implies that media outlets with different politicalaffinities present themselves with different issue repertoires rather than different opinionson particular issues. It assumes that different papers will position themselves in thepolitical spectrum by differential relevance assignments. Different editorial positions ofmedia outlets should therefore be reflected by a particular issue selection and presentationrather than through partisan arguments and evaluations. This view stands in sharp contrastto the traditional spatial view of party competition which assumes that parties offerdifferent policy solutions to the same issues.The traditional view, based on Downs´ understanding of party competition, concentrateson the political positions on an issue (Downs 1957). In liberal democracies partiescompete for the approval of the electorate by offering certain policies designed to solveparticular problems. The concept is based on a rational choice paradigm that assumes thatvoters after collecting all necessary information choose the policy alternative that comesclosest to their individual needs and interests. The salience model contested this paradigmby focusing on issue hierarchies rather than positions on particular issues, but it is an openquestion whether or not particular issues are clearly linked with certain positions (Voltmer1998/99, 72). This paper applies the assumptions of the position model of partycompetition to the German media system. Rather than examining the differential issueselection among the five quality newspapers under study, it investigates the politicalpositions these media outlets hold on certain issues8.Due to the variety of possible positions for any given issue partisanship in the media isfrequently assessed in single-issue analyse with a set of issue-specific pro and contraarguments as indicators for media opinion. In order to assess policy preferences across the8 For a test of the salience model see Eilders (2000).8entire spectrum of issues, however, a more abstract conceptualization of ideology isneeded. Voltmer developed a concept for the analysis of political positions in publicdiscourse that is sufficiently abstract to assess political positions in an all-issue studybecause it uses general principles of political action (Scarbrough 1984) instead of specificpolicies. These principles are deductively derived from a classification of areas of politicalintervention such as the economic and social system, institutional units, social groups,individuals and the transnational surroundings9. The concept reduces the variety ofprinciples regarding one area of intervention to traditionally left, liberal or progressive andtraditionally right, conservative and authoritarian alternatives. Positions in this conceptthus are bipolar action-oriented alternative means to achieve political goals rather thangoals themselves.The concept developed by Voltmer is not only theoretically sophisticated andconvincing from an empirical perspective as it clearly differentiates between theideological positions of different media outlets (Voltmer 1998/99). Using thisconceptionalization it is possible to go beyond a general left-right dimension of opinionand investigate the degree of consonance separately for each individual conflict betweenfundamental alternatives. Regarding the pattern of left and right positions on thoseconflicts, it can be expected that the profile of a paper with left party allegiances showsmore similarities with other liberal than with conservative papers. Also, a conservativepaper should resemble the pattern of positions of other conservative papers. It should beinteresting, however, to examine which conflicts are nevertheless evaluatedcorrespondingly.4. Research Design and OperationalizationFocusing on editorials the notion of media competition gains special significance sinceeditorials provide an easy means to communicate an outlet’s particular view and addressthe corresponding segments of the audience. In Germany, editorials do not representindividual views of single journalists, but indicate the editorial stance of a media outlet.Editorials reflect the political views of the papers and serve as a forum of presentation forthe mediás genuine view of public affairs. Since the opinion section does not have tocomply with the information function of neutral reporting, it can be expected that thedifferent political positions of media outlets become most visible and distinguishable ineditorials.Employing a content analysis of editorials in the five German quality newspapersbetween 1994 and 1998 we investigated the political positions of the individual9 The principles of action were supplemented with two Germany-specific dimensions regarding theunification process by Voltmer (1998/99).9newspapers and assessed the degree of consonance among them. All political editorialswere included in the analysis, with the exception of editorials on exclusively internationalnews without reference to domestic German politics. The coding unit was the individualarticle. The analysis is based on a sample of “Die Welt”, “FAZ”, “SZ”, “FR”, and “taz” fortwo quarters of each year between 1994 and 1998 starting with the second and fourthquarter in the first year, continuing with the first and third quarter in the following year,and switching quarters every other year. The sample was designed to include the coveragein the fall (fourth quarter) of 1994 and 1998 when national elections were held inGermany.In order to assess the political positions of the papers the instrument developed byVoltmer (1998/99) was adapted and slightly modified. The basic conflicts divide into fiveconflict dimensions. The first dimension, Economic Wealth and Distribution, includes fiveseparate conflicts representing competing – either left or right - views about the adequatemeans to achieve wealth and just distribution. It includes State Intervention vs. MarketEconomy, State Responsibility vs. Individual Responsibility, Demand-Side vs. Supply-Side, Tax Increase vs. Tax Reduction, and Regulation vs. Incentives (see appendix fordetails). The second dimension, Institutional and Individual Autonomy, includes four basicconflicts: Centralism vs. Autonomy, Separation vs. Unification, Need vs. Condition, andIndividual Rights vs. State Control. These conflicts relate to liberal or conservative viewson the autonomy of subsystems from the greater system. The other three conflictdimensions Cultural Identity, Societal Integration, and External Security each include twobasic conflicts. Cultural Identity relates to the relation between “us” and “the others” andincludes Cosmopolitanism vs. Ethnocentrism and Cultural Identity vs. Integration. SocietalIntegration including the conflicts Prevention vs. Sanction and Participation vs.Representation concerns progressive and authoritarian views on integration. ExternalSecurity including the conflicts Co-operation vs. Conflict and Supra-nationalism vs.Sovereignty refers to the alternatives of co-operative and confrontative principles ininternational relations. In order to represent conflicts regarding positions toward the “newpolitics” (ecology, disarmament) for which the conflicts described above do not apply anadditional conflict was developed. The left position supports the need to control possiblerisks from new technologies whereas the right position stands for a preference for riskacceptance (details in the appendix).The sample included 8,717 editorials in five newspapers over five years. For eacheditorial up to three issues, three basic conflicts and three positions on these conflicts couldbe coded. The issue coding scheme was composed of 45 fairly abstract issue categories1010 In the case of our all-issue analysis over five years we were forced to move away from concrete event-type issue categories (restricted by time and space) and define issues on a fairly abstract level. Issues inour coding scheme can be described as policy, politics or polity areas rather than specific controversies.Thus, we differentiate between tax policy and legal system, but not between concrete debates or decisionsregarding those issues.10like specific policy areas (e.g. environment, foreign relations or traffic engineering) andpolity as well as politics aspects11 of the political system (like elections, political style orparties and movements). Representing alternative policy options the basic conflicts thatcould be addressed in commenting on an issue did not apply for issues regarding politicsand polity aspects rather than particular policies. Since our consonance measure relies onthe newspapers´ positions on these conflicts, only the 15,890 issues regarding policy areasout of the total of 23,160 issues were considered for the purpose of this analysis.For every policy issue addressed in the editorials, the coders had to decide whether ornot the commentators referred to one of the 16 basic conflicts in discussing the issue. Ifone of the conflicts was addressed the issue was considered to be fundamentalized sincethe underlying political principles were discussed. For these issues they had to decidewhether the commentator supported the left or the right position, took an ambivalent standon the conflict or did not express any specific evaluation at all12. Relating basic conflictsand the positions on these conflicts to particular issues enables us to investigate whether ornot an issue is discussed with regard to fundamental policy alternatives and which policyalternative is supported for each issue. We can thus identify a range of conflicts referred toin a fundamental discussion of an issue as well as the respective positions on those issuesand get a differentiated multidimensional picture of the opinions expressed in an editorial.If an editorial deals with right wing extremism and migration e.g. the issue might either berelated to the conflict prevention vs. sanction or to cosmopolitanism vs. ethnocentrism.Prevention vs. sanction, however, might also represent the relevant conflict in discussinginternal security. Whereas a commentator might support the sanction option regarding rightwing extremism and migration, he or she might show a preference for the preventionprinciple in internal security. This illustrates that the political position expressed in aneditorial not only depends on the kind of issue, but also varies with the kind of basicconflict the issue is related to. Consonance from this perspective does not only regard theissue and the position on the issue, it also considers the particular conflict addressed.In assessing the degree of consonance between different papers that continuouslycomment daily politics it is necessary to pay attention to the dimension of time. If aparticular paper holds a certain opinion on taxes in 1994 while another paper supports thatparticular position in 1998, they both display the same opinion regarding tax policy in theaggregate measure of the five years under study. Yet, a correspondence in the strict sensecannot be assumed without regarding the same time period. The two papers might have11 Politics and polity issues relate to structural and procedural aspects of the political system. They includedthe following issues: Parties and Movements, Social Order, Principles of Political Action, Political Style,Coalitions, Elections, Parliament and its Members, State and Government, Unification and GermanQuestion, and Political Views and Ideologies.12 If no conflict was addressed with a particular issue, “no reference” was coded. If the conflict wasaddressed but the commentator did not show support for either side “no evaluation” was coded. Supportor rejection of both policy alternatives marked the ambivalent position between left and right principles(see table 1).11expressed their opinions about two distinctly different tax-related events (or maybe even tothe same event but at a different time against a different background). Without restrictingthe comparison between two newspapers to short time periods guaranteeing the samecontext of current affairs, the validity of the correspondence measure has to be questioned.After all, the notion of corresponding issue selection is based on a shared evaluation of apolicy option at a given time. Parallel judgements thus fundamentally involve the sametime reference. Corresponding positions can only be assumed if two papers support thesame principle of action at the same time.The time reference might be a day – a very strict criterion but meeting the media’sproduction logic - , but can also be extended to a week thereby leaving enough time for allthe papers to develop a position on the issue. This seems to be especially appropriate forevents lasting longer than a day. This paper employs weekly measures thereby taking therisk that two evaluations of the same issue refer to two different events in that week.Measures on a daily basis, however, do not tolerate any time lags in coverage, severelyreduce the number of cases for comparison and thus make it almost impossible to calculateconsonance on a sound empirical basis.The degree of consonance was assessed separately for each issue by comparing thenewspapers´ positions on each of the basic conflicts addressed with the issue. Consonancewas conceptionalized as negative or inverted dissonance in the media system with thestandard deviation between the newspapers´ positions serving as dissonance measure13. Ahigh level of consonance is indicated by a low standard deviation (dissonance), whereas ahigh standard deviation (dissonance) points to a low level of consonance.5. FindingsThe issue frequencies varied considerably indicating differential relevance assignments bythe newspapers (table 1). Foreign and European policy, economic policy and taxesreceived most attention, whereas commercial law, business promotion and infrastructurepolicy were hardly commented on14.13 For each paper and issue a mean position - the means of “left”, “ambivalent”, and “right” on the variousconflicts addressed with a given issue - had to be calculated. Thus, each paper and issue received a meanposition for every conflict that was addressed and the standard deviation was calculated among thenewspapers. In order to consider the preference of a newspaper for certain conflicts when discussing a gi-ven issue, the conflict frequencies for each issue were used as a weight in the calculation of the newspa-pers´ mean position on the issue and in the calculation of the standard deviation. This procedure resultedin weighted weekly positions per newspaper and in weighted weekly standard deviations and then avera-ged over the weeks. We are grateful to Christian Galonska who did the data analysis for this article.14 Since issues in content analyses are categorized according to the specific research question of a projectand there is no “natural” category size for reality some issue categories include more cases than others.Foreign policy, e.g. seems to be far more inclusive than business promotion. Yet, as long as we onlycompare issue frequencies relationally (over time or between newspapers) and do not evaluate the generallevel of issue diversity, any sort of categorization can be appropriate.12Table 1:Shares of positions, non-evaluative conflict references and fundamentalization15 for each issueIssueForeign PolicyEuropean PolicyEconomic PolicyTax PolicyLabour and EmploymentRight-wing Radicalism, Migration PolicyLegal PolicyLegal SystemEducation PolicyIndustrial Relations PolicyInternal SecurityEnergy PolicyHealth PolicyEnvironmental PolicyEconomic SystemBudgetary PolicyMedia PolicyTwo German StatesFamily and Youth PolicyAlliance PolicyDefense PolicyRegulations PolicyFederalismTraffic EngineeringForeign TradeSocial SystemPeace PolicyCulture PolicyMonetary PolicyPension PolicyPolicy of Research and DevelopmentSocial PolicyInfrastructure PolicyBusiness PromotionCommercial Law28,339,716,712,218,738,015,518,717,211,016,840,835,245,018,46,121,27,731,740,011,017,122,822,615,436,840,410,36,125,834,041,220,118,113,0tfeL12,714,55,98,15,45,27,84,37,77,06,25,57,34,98,83,85,34,05,614,73,34,48,18,45,39,812,83,03,19,411,26,66,714,24,6tnelavibmAthgiRnoitaulaveoNecnereferoNlatoT17,79,423,438,522,522,729,516,316,924,924,215,518,714,828,814,911,514,120,311,712,017,819,618,218,028,213,68,119,315,018,813,218,140,230,613,422,314,429,017,413,712,46,010,715,511,915,911,914,313,712,010,08,014,422,38,010,435,49,110,216,211,13,88,823,54,614,36,017,313,927,914,139,512,336,020,534,954,747,441,540,922,326,821,030,263,252,166,328,111,365,650,314,041,651,19,022,174,862,726,331,524,749,010,238,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0100,0-ne nam itod azun liF ta72,185,960,587,764,079,565,145,352,658,559,177,773,279,069,836,847,933,771,988,734,449,786,058,448,991,077,925,237,373,768,575,351,089,862,0N123388487985377777276069568568267356647746743042434032630630029929828527426626623523422821319718214912710815 Fundamentalization marks the share all conflict references (“left”, “ambivalent” and “right” positions,“no evaluation”) expressed in addressing an issue out of the total number of issue references. “Noreference” marks the share of issue references without addressing one of the basic conflicts.13The differential relevance assignments to particular issues have to be kept in mind whendiscussing the general position of the newspapers and the degree of consonance for eachissue. In this respect, the evaluations concerning foreign and European policy have muchmore potential to characterize the editorial discourse than the evaluations regardingcommercial law or business promotion.In about two thirds of the cases the issues dealt with in the editorials were related to oneof the 16 basic conflicts mentioned above. One third of the issues, however, was discussedwithout reference to those policy alternatives. Instead of fundamentalizing the issue interms of discussing the underlying political principle, the commentators might havefocused on specific details of an event or certain aspects of the issue like the actors´performance, the timing of an announcement or legal or historical aspects. The individualissues showed different degrees of fundamentalization. Highly fundamentalized issueswere the social system, business promotion and alliance policy, whereas culture policy,two German states, and defence policy were only rarely related to a basic conflict. It isinteresting to note that the most frequently addressed issues were not always the mostfundamentalized ones. The degree to which an issue can be related to a basic conflict thusdoes not make it more suitable for commentary. There is no systematic relation betweenthe attention directed at an issue and the tendency to relate an issue to underlyingconflicts16 (Table 1, figure 1). Regarding the opinions expressed in the editorials, thecommentators showed a slight preference for the left, liberal or progressive over the right,conservative or authoritarian policy options across all issues (23.4% vs. 20.2%)17.Especially environment, energy, alliance and peace policy received large shares of leftevaluations (table 1, figure 1). Yet, some issues – such as taxes and business promotion -were clearly evaluated with a preference for the right. Regarding the mean positions on thebasic conflicts addressed in the editorials across all issues, we found considerabledifferences among the five newspapers under study (figure 2). Results indicate that Weltwas located at the right of the left-right scale (2.4 where 1 is left and 3 is right), the FAZfollowed closely (2.3). The middle position was taken by the SZ (1.8), and the FR (1.6)and taz marked the left pole (1.6). Considering all newspapers together there was a slightbias to the left side of the scale indicating that the German quality press tended to take amedium to left position on the issues at stake. The newspapers displayed considerabledistances from the extreme left and right pole rather than covering the entire politicalspectrum. The distribution of the papers on the left-right continuum found on the basis ofour conceptualization of media opinion confirms former studies based on content analysesas well as expert opinions18.16 No linear or non-linear correlation was detected between the quantitative significance of an issue and thedegree of fundamentalization (tendency of the commentators to relate an issue to a basic conflict). Themean position on the conflicts did not correlate with the issue frequency either.17 In roughly 15% of the cases they did not indicate any preferences, and for 7.5% of the issues theysupported both views expressing an ambivalent position.18 Kepplinger (1985), Hagen (1992), Schönbach (1977), Donsbach/Wolling/Blomberg (1996).14Figure 1: Shares of positions and non-evaluative conflict references for each issue19leftambivalentrightno evaluationno referenceLabour and EmploymentRight-wing Radicalism, Migration PolicyForeign PolicyEuropean PolicyEconomic PolicyTax PolicyLegal PolicyLegal SystemEducation PolicyIndustrial Relations PolicyInternal SecurityEnergy PolicyHealth PolicyEnvironmental PolicyEconomic SystemBudgetary PolicyMedia PolicyTwo German StatesFamily and Youth PolicyAlliance PolicyDefense PolicyRegulations PolicyFederalismTraffic EngineeringSocial SystemForeign TradePeace PolicyCulture PolicyMonetary PolicyPension PolicySocial PolicyInfrastructure PolicyBusiness PromotionCommercial LawPolicy of Research and Development0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%19 “Left”, “ambivalent” and “right” positions, and “no evaluation” add up to the share of fundamentalizationof an issue. “No reference” marks the share of issue references not fundamentalized.Figure 2: Mean political position of all five newspapers20 (N=8158 evaluative references)1left1,55 1,58taz FR1,82SZ2,31 2,39FAZ Welt3right15Table 2: Mean political positions on 16 basic conflicts across newspapersConflictCo-operation vs. ConflictSupra-nationalism vs. SovereigntyState Intervention vs. Market EconomyState Responsibility vs. Individual ResponsibilityDemand-Side vs. Supply-SideRegulation vs. IncentivesTax Increase vs. Tax ReductionCentralism vs. AutonomySeparation vs. UnificationNeed vs. ConditionIndividual Rights vs. State ControlPrevention vs. SanctionParticipation vs. RepresentationCosmopolitanism vs. EthnocentrismCultural Identity vs. IntegrationControl of New Technologiesvs. Acceptance of Risktaz FR SZ FAZ Welt TotalN=1505 N=1605 N=1673 N=1670 N=1705 N=81581,90 1,96 1,62 1,71 1,73 1,781,32 1,26 1,49 1,52 1,44 1,401,66 1,46 2,32 2,62 2,70 2,151,24 1,18 1,40 2,29 2,38 1,701,31 1,25 2,23 2,96 2,82 2,111,89 1,81 1,96 2,44 2,45 2,111,98 2,01 2,41 2,89 2,87 2,432,24 2,29 2,23 1,93 2,11 2,162,24 2,21 2,13 2,96 2,85 2,481,59 1,36 1,72 2,21 2,31 1,841,49 1,84 1,87 2,45 2,40 2,011,78 1,94 2,06 2,65 2,76 2,241,17 1,25 1,28 2,42 2,11 1,651,09 1,02 1,12 2,49 2,72 1,691,48 1,60 1,23 3,00 2,50 1,961,16 1,20 1,35 2,29 2,09 1,6220 The mean positions represent the average of all left, amivalent, and right positions expressed with anykind of basic conflict addressed by a newspaper.

Breaking down the political positions of the newspapers into theindividual conflicts addressed, we found distinct profiles for each paper regarding theirparticular focus of concern (table 2). The left spectrum supported larger shares of left,liberal and progressive positions in almost every basic conflict whereas the conservativepress supported larger shares of right, conservative and authoritarian positions (table 2,figure 3). Since the newspapers did not always follow their general ideological position onthe left-right scale in every conflict, however, we identified conflicts with a tendencytowards left and conflicts with a tendency towards right evaluations. The papers clearlytended to lean towards the left in Co-operation vs. Conflict, Supra-nationalism vs.Sovereignty conflict, State vs. Individual Responsibility, Participation vs. Representation,Cosmopolitanism vs. Ethnocentrism, and Control vs. Acceptance of Risk. A rightpartisanship was displayed in the conflicts Tax Increase vs. Reduction, Separation vs.Unification, and Prevention vs. Sanction (table 2, figure 3).The conservative Welt and the FAZ took a liberal stand on the two international politicsconflicts, the left wing taz and FR in turn expressed right positions regarding the questionsof unification. The typically centrist SZ went with the right spectrum in conflicts related toeconomy and taxes (State Intervention vs. Market Economy, Demand-Side vs. Supply-Side, Tax Increase vs. Tax Reduction), and – like all the papers – on Centralism vs.Autonomy. In sum, no paper exclusively held either left or right positions. A clearcleavage, however, was found between the Welt and FAZ on the one hand and the SZ, FRand taz on the other hand. Only in conflicts regarding economic matters the SZ deviatesfrom the left-wing papers21.Although the ideological profiles of the newspapers already indicate a certain degree ofconflict in the media system, they do not render statements about the parallel evaluationsof the five newspapers at a given point in time. A systematic consideration of the timedimension lead to a conceptualization of consonance on the basis of weekly comparisonsof the newspapers´ positions for each individual issue. Considering the issue-specificaverage positions of the newspapers across the weeks, we found that social, environmental,peace, and alliance policy and European policy tended to receive high shares of leftevaluations (table 3). German unification, monetary, and tax policy, on the other hand,were evaluated more conservatively. As already noted with regard to the newspaperprofiles on the basic conflicts, for some of the issues the newspapers deviated from their21 Disregarding the conflicts and examining the newspapers´ positions with respect to the issues we foundalmost the same pattern of differences between the papers (without table). Left papers were likely toexpress left positions on most of the issues (but not on all of them) and right papers showed higher sharesof right positions on most issues (but not on all of them).18general ideological position on the left-right scale. In the area of federalism, alliance andforeign policy the conservative newspapers even held more liberal positions than theliberal papers22.Comparing the newspapers´ positions on the issues for each individual week, we foundthe highest degree of consonance for commercial law, budgetary policy and alliancepolicy23. The least consonant evaluations were received by federalism, social order andculture policy (table 3). Still, with respect to the low quantitative significance of an issue(table 1) we cannot predict high degrees of societal unrest related to the issues offederalism and social system or either identify broad spheres of consensus in society on thebasis of consonant evaluations of commercial law, budgetary and alliance policy. Conflictor consonance in the area of international politics, economy, taxes, labour and employmentand right-wing radicalism and migration are likely to be much more relevant as theseissues better reflect the character of editorial discourse.The most consonant and most dissonant issues did not attract much editorial attention.Yet, there is no systematic relation between the issue frequencies and the level of opinioncorrespondences among the newspapers24. Editorial attention does not depend on thedegree of conflict or consonance in the media system. With respect to the absolutesignificance of certain issues in editorial discourse, our discussion of the degree ofconsonance among the newspapers will concentrate on the issues most frequentlyaddressed by the commentators. Within those frequently addressed issues foreign andEuropean policy and education policy displayed comparably high degrees of consonance,whereas internal security, legal policy and right wing extremism and migration showedlow degrees of consonance. Moderate degrees of consonance were found for economicpolicy, taxes, labour and employment, the legal system and industrial relations policy.Editorial discourse between 1994 to 1998 can thus be characterized by a broad coalitionamong the newspapers regarding external affairs and educational matters, while issuesrelated to law and order and migration issues were discussed highly controversial.22 Certain characteristics of the events taking place in the time period under study might explain theseunexpected results. During the Bosnian crisis the German left was reluctant to comply with theexpectations of the other NATO-members who wanted a stronger military engagement of Germany andmore co-operation with the NATO. Regarding this problem the left papers put forward a more isolationistview which affected their position on the conflict Co-operation vs. Conflict. The evaluation of thefederalism issue was dominated by problems connected with the integration of the former East-Germanstates. Here, the left papers supported their autonomy, usually a more conservative position.23 The degree of consonance per issue was derived from the weighted consonance measures for each basicconflict addressed with the issue. For details of the weighting procedure see footnote 13.24 Neither linear nor non-linear correlations could be detected.IssueRight-wing Radicalism, MigrationPolicyForeign PolicyTwo German StatesEuropean PolicyDefence PolicyAlliance PolicyPeace PolicyInfrastructure PolicyTraffic EngineeringEnergy PolicyEnvironmental PolicyCulture PolicyEducation PolicyPolicy of Research and DevelopmentMedia PolicyLegal PolicyLegal SystemRegulations PolicyUnification and German QuestionInternal SecurityFederalismSocial PolicyFamily and Youth PolicyPension PolicyHealth PolicySocial SystemLabour and EmploymentIndustrial Relations PolicyEconomic PolicyEconomic SystemCommercial LawForeign TradeBudgetary PolicyTax PolicyBusiness PromotionMonetary PolicyTotaltaz1,411,861,751,522,051,851,261,501,501,411,421,801,631,501,571,591,221,942,501,522,431,231,221,051,021,391,381,851,481,401,751,432,002,111,921,881,57FR1,471,951,751,441,241,581,661,301,751,361,441,631,871,551,891,871,531,582,001,642,341,041,401,421,271,211,521,681,371,352,331,531,591,981,621,501,58SZ1,431,692,041,651,851,721,511,842,241,581,492,251,871,831,671,881,631,972,671,871,941,321,301,901,401,572,112,472,212,242,582,362,202,122,352,391,862,451,722,711,522,331,621,922,002,272,582,291,632,002,231,862,682,492,363,002,661,622,442,322,032,322,792,622,822,622,742,862,282,672,832,913,002,332,681,692,311,742,341,471,772,542,242,372,042,132,212,122,272,632,422,132,712,761,992,731,982,462,232,902,812,572,722,752,312,552,852,782,362,802,401,751,762,191,602,041,621,581,871,911,711,561,931,951,851,802,251,831,972,722,121,931,491,831,961,751,812,102,292,182,102,192,102,272,422,202,481,95Table 3:Mean positions per issue across newspapers, mean position per issue for all evaluative referencesin the newspaper spectrum, and degree of dissonance among the newspapers25FAZWeltPositionDissonance25 The frequencies of each basic conflict addressed with a particular issue was used as a weight for thecalculation of the mean position for that issue.

Issuesregarding legal matters (legal policy, legal system, and internal security) were discussedwith reference to the conflicts Prevention vs. Sanction and Individual Rights vs. StateControl. They displayed low to moderate degrees of consonance with a right tendency inmost of the conflicts. Regarding the legal system, however, individual rights werepreferred over state control, so a strong left partisanship competed with the strongpreference for sanction rather than prevention. Issues regarding economic aspects (labourand employment, industrial relations, economic policy) evolved around the conflicts StateIntervention vs. Market Economy, Demand vs. Supply Side, State vs. IndividualResponsibility, Regulation vs. Incentives, and Centralism vs. Autonomy. They showed lowdegrees of consonance and a clear preference for right positions, except for the conflictState vs. Individual Responsibility in the Labour and Employment issue where thecommentators clearly attributed responsibility to the state. Education and tax policy wererelated to one main conflict only and showed low levels of consonance. Commentators oneducation policy showed a slight tendency to support the right position in the conflictCentralism vs. Autonomy. Regarding the tax issue they showed a strong support for theright position of tax reduction.6. Summary and DiscussionThe analysis examined the political positions of five German quality newspapers on policyissues addressed in their editorials. Employing a content analytical instrument thatconceptionalized positions as abstract preferences for fundamental alternatives of politicalaction it was possible to assess the ideological profiles of the newspapers in terms of left orright partisanship regarding 16 basic conflicts and identify spheres of conflict andconsensus in editorial discourse. The general political positions of the papers confirmedformer studies of the German newspaper spectrum with the FAZ and Welt located on theright hand side of the scale, the FR and taz located on the left, and the SZ taking the middleposition.Although we found clear cut cleavages between left and right newspapers theevaluations by the commentators did not always follow the newspapers´ generalideological position on all the issues and with regard to all the conflicts. That means thepositions expressed by the newspapers varied considerably across the issues. Especially22issues regarding external relations, some aspects of the social question, and environmentcan be regarded as issues with a tendency for left partisanship. Most economic andfinancial matters as well as German unification, on the other hand, seemed to bepredominantly discussed from a conservative perspective. For some issues the ideologicalpositions of the newspapers even contradicted our expectations. A left bias regardinginternational politics displayed by the conservative papers was paralleled by a right bias onquestions of German unification that was shown by the liberal newspapers.In sum, liberal and conservative papers displayed surprisingly corresponding positionson some issues, while they strongly disagreed on others. Regarding the most frequentlyaddressed issues only external relations and education were commented on withcomparably consonant positions while most other issues - especially legal matters andmigration - were controversially debated. The results represent strong evidence for theposition model of left-right competition. Newspapers with opposite political positions takeconflicting positions on given issues. Since there was only limited parallel issue selectionin any given week, however, the consonance could only be assessed for few issues in fewweeks. Even without separately testing the salience model29, the difficulties calculating theconsonance measure with only few weeks of parallel issue selections already indicates thatnewspapers do in fact differ in terms of relevance assignment. They do not routinelyaddress the same issues in a given week but rather emphasize certain issues that theircompetitors do not assign relevance to. Thus, the salience model is not at all rejected byour results. Instead, both models seem to apply. Newspapers compete through differentialrelevance assignment but also hold different positions on the issues that nevertheless arecorrespondingly addressed.As there is no normative optimum of consonance and conflict in the media, we can onlyspeculate on the implications of our findings for the pluralistic ideal on the one hand andthe integration potential of media on the other hand. The relatively low degrees ofconsonance detected in this analysis, however, do not seem to represent a severe danger todemocracy and do not point to a completely mainstreamed media opinion. As some issuesstill marked consensual spheres there is no evidence of a general cleavage between the leftand right newspaper spectrum pointing to a high level of desintegration.Regarding the question of differential relevance assignment to particular issues, ourfindings disappointed some common expectations. There is no causal relationship betweenthe quantitative relevance of an issue and the degree of conflict or consonance: Issuesdiscussed highly controversial among the five newspapers do not necessarily attract mucheditorial attention in a given week. Even though conflict between certain actors has provedto be a highly efficient news factor, the degree of conflict between different newspapers29 The salience model was tested in a previous article (see Eilders 2000).23does not result in high levels of media attention. Neither are highly consensual issues likelyto be addressed more frequently. We found no evidence that the media in their editorialsdirect attention to consonant issues calling to mind the spheres of consensus in society andthereby enhancing integration. As fundamentalization and the mean position of an issuehave not prooved to be good predictors for media attention either, it seems to depend oncertain inherent characteristics of issues and concrete political events rather than on themedia opinion and the constellations of opinion in the media system whether or not anissue receives editorial attention.247.

It centersaround the question to what extent the state should intervene in economic processes. Oneanswer to the question emphasizes the importance of the market, the other answer stressesstate intervention.State intervention:The emphasis is on state intervention and the creation of a mixed economy is called for.Uncontrolled market forces are assumed to end in imbalances with unintended economic aswell as social consequences. Therefore, state intervention in economic processes isconsidered necessary. Sometimes, the state itself becomes an economic entrepreneur.Market economy:The emphasis is on market forces. It is assumed that the market is capable of structuringthe economic and social conditions of economic processes effectively. Economic activityof the state is considered ineffective. Thus, state intervention is rejected and theprivatization of state enterprises is encouraged.The State Responsibility vs. Individual Responsibility DimensionThis dimension refers to different principles of responsibility in the relationship betweenstate and society. The question is who is responsible for evening out social inequalities.Answers to this question are of particular importance for welfare policies. Individualresponsibility and state responsibility are distinguished as policy positions.State responsibility:The emphasis is on the responsibility of the state or collective agencies to provide goodsand services to even out social inequalities and fulfil individual needs. The assignment ofstate responsibility is usually associated with a tendency to institutionalize social rights.Individual responsibility:This principle is often referred to as the subsidiary principle (Subsidiaritätsprinzip). Itemphasizes the responsibility of the individual or social groups and social organizations(e.g. family, neighbourhood, churches) for all tasks they can reasonably take uponthemselves. Only if the solution of a problem exceeds the resources of the individual orsocial group, higher level groups or organizations and finally the state are supposed to act.The principle of individual responsibility is usually associated with a political tendency tocut back government activity in society.The Demand-Side vs. Supply-Side DimensionThis dimension refers to monetary and fiscal policies of the state. The question is in whichdirection state intervention into income distribution has to be done. A supply-side positionand a demand-side position are distinguished.Demand-side orientation:The goal is on supporting consumers (private households) in the market process. It isassumed that strengthening the "effective demand" will result in a stronger supply-side.29Demand-side oriented policies center on measures to increase private income, e.g. byprograms for employment and improving workforce quality. All welfare aid that improvesincome (e.g. unemployment benefits, child allowances) can also be regarded as elements ofdemand-side oriented policies.Supply-side orientation:The goal is on supporting investment activities of private economic actors. It is assumedthat in the first place the supply-side should be supported. As a result, consumers wouldalso be strengthened. Supply-side oriented policies focus on the improvement of conditionsfor private enterprises. Main instruments are the reduction of taxes, wages, andentrepreneurial risks.The Tax Increase vs. Tax Reduction DimensionThis dimension refers to the resources of the government budget. The question is to whatextent the state should burden the economy and private incomes in order to fulfil its tasks.This conflict was sharpened by the challenges resulting from the reconstruction of EastGermany after unification.Tax increase:The state is regarded as responsible for a wide variety of public - tasks which necessarilyrequire extensive financial resources. Besides the classical tasks of the state like theguarantee of internal and external security, other tasks such as welfare, education andinfrastructure are also seen as in the scope of its responsibility.Tax reduction:The scope of state tasks is defined restrictively. The state should confine itself to theclassical tasks, while goals like education, infrastructure and parts of welfare are assignedto private organisations. High taxes are considered as an obstruction of economic growthand private initiative, resulting in inflation and unemployment.The Regulation vs. Incentives DimensionThis dimension refers to the political instruments aimed to influence economic or socialbehavior, especially in the areas of labour market and environmental protection, whichcreate enormous deficits and where the means of problem-solving are highly disputed. Thepolicy positions here are regulation and incentives.Regulation:A particular behavior is regulated by binding norms. The typical instrument of regulation isthe law.Incentives:A particular behaviour is encouraged by the state by providing incentives. This policyposition relies on economic incentives to bring about a desired behaviour (rewards) and oneconomic disincentives to block undesirable behaviour (duties). It is up to the individual toobserve incentives or disincentives or to accept the consequences.30The Centralism vs. Autonomy DimensionThis dimension points to different conceptions of how the relationship between the centralstate and its diverse sub-units should be organized. In particular, it applies to federalismand the degree of autonomy cultural organizations, such as mass media and churches, oreconomic organizations, such as employers and trade unions, should have. The positions ofautonomy and centralism are distinguished.Centralism:The emphasis is on the strengthening and expansion of the central state's rights and powerwith respect to the smaller sub-units. This policy position accords the central state adominant role. The central state pursues this goal by making use of his main resources,Legislation and distribution of money.Autonomy:The emphasis is on the smaller units' rights and autonomy with respect to the central stateor the role of the federal government. The autonomy position stresses that sub-units shouldact on the basis of their own resources and their own decision making.The Separation vs. Unification DimensionThis dimension refers to the relation between the two parts of Germany, especially afterthe breakdown of socialism. The dimension refers not only to inter-state relations, but alsoto the relation between organizations (interest groups, parties) that then existed in bothparts of the country.Separation:The (partial) autonomy of the two parts of Germany and its institutions is stressed. Thegoal is a confederation of the two German states, at least the persistence of East Germaninstitutions. Sometimes the demand is merely to postpone national or institutionalunification.Unification:The national unity is regarded as the highly valued and preferred structure. Unification atall levels is demanded as fast as possible. The persistence of institutions of the formerGDR is rejected.The Need vs. Condition DimensionThis dimension refers to how the differences in terms of wealth and power between Eastand West Germany can be reduced. The alternatives indicate different modes of thetransfer of resources from the West to the East.Need:The transfer of resources is defined by the needs of East Germany. Money, manpower andknow-how are transferred. A further demand is to share political power. The support by theWest is considered as a matter of national solidarity.Condition:Support and transfer are only given when certain conditions the reconstruction ofinstitutions and the implementation of market economy, are met. In particular, politicalpower is only shared when the East German politicians have proved their integrity.31The Individual Rights vs. State Control DimensionThis dimension points to the tension between individual and society. The problem is howto ensure the cohesion of the society which is made up of many individuals. One answer tothis problem stresses individual rights, the other emphasizes state control.Individual Rights:This position assumes that the individual is able to choose the "right way" withoutendangering the rights of other individuals and the interests of the community. Theindividual should get the chance for self-determination. The individual has to be protectedfrom the state and social pressure for conformity. The individual is regarded as responsibleand rational.State control:The assumption is that the pursuit of individual rights and interests tends to violate thecommon interest. Thus, the individual has to fit into society and has to accept customs,norms, rules, duties and his or her particular role, even if this would run counter one's ownneeds and goals.The Cosmopolitanism vs. Ethnocentrism DimensionThis dimension refers to the relationship to foreign cultures and ethnic groups outside thesociety. It also captures the degree to which the own culture and the own people should befavoured in domestic legislation. Ethnocentrism and cosmopolitanism are distinguished aspolicy positions.Cosmopolitanism:The emphasis is on the equal value of different cultures and nations ("opening"). Thispolicy position rests on universalistic values and pluralism. Possibilities of immigration areregarded liberally.Ethnocentrism:The emphasis is on the superiority and priority of the own culture and nation ("closure").The ethnocentrist position draws from the conviction that one's own culture and norms areof more value than others. But even without such an evaluation, one makes a cleardistinction between one's own group and foreign groups. Possibilities of immigration areinterpreted restrictively.The Cultural Identity vs. Integration DimensionThis dimension refers to how to handle culturally and ethnically different groups in thesociety. Should groups be encouraged to keep their cultural identity (multiculturalism) orshould they be encouraged to assimilate? In this context, in Germany, problems havearisen, particularly with the guest-workers. Presently, it has gained new importance withthe opening of the borders, both within the EC and with the Eastern countries. Further, itrefers to the situation in the reunified Germany where people with different experiences,values, styles of life and economic conditions live together.Cultural identity:The emphasis is on the originality, identity and the specific rights of different cultures andethnic groups living together. Cultural identity means that culturally different groups live32together in a community, but each wants and is granted to preserve its own culturalparticularities. The diversity of culturally and ethnically different groups is considered tobe a valuable addition for societal life. This might also find its expression in rights andinstitutions.Integration:The emphasis is on the necessity of cultural adaptation and integration into the dominantculture in order to make living together possible. Integration takes place culturally(adaptation to values, styles of life, language), socially (similarity of socio-economicconditions), and formally (legislation). Integration is regarded as a precondition for fullparticipation in political, economic and social affairs of the host culture.The Prevention vs. Sanction DimensionThis dimension refers to the question of which instruments should be used to preventdeviant behaviour (e.g. crime) and to guarantee law and order. The main policy area of thisdimension is penal Legislation and law enforcement. The positions of sanction andprevention are distinguished.Prevention:This policy position emphasizes preventive measures to counteract deviant behaviour.There is the conviction that circumstances can be altered in a way to prevent deviant orcriminal behaviour. The solution to deviant behaviour is seen in changing societalconditions. Thus, ultimately the society is responsible for a successful socialization.Sanction:The emphasis is on authoritative acts to punish deviant behaviour. The functions ofpunishment arc both atonement and deterrence. It is assumed that deviant behaviour can becontrolled by threat of punishment. Thus, higher crime rates are usually responded to byheavier sanctions.The Participation vs. Representation DimensionThis dimension refers to the relationship between the citizen and the political system. Thequestion is to what extent the citizens should participate in political decisions. The policypositions on this dimension are representation and participation.Participation:The emphasis is on the right of the citizen to participate and have a direct say in ongoingpolicy decisions. The underlying principle is an extensive model of democracy. The goal isto extend the possibilities and the modes of participation. Beyond voting in elections,direct modes of participation, such as referenda and plebiscites, are approved. Further,democratic participation should include as many areas of society as possible (e.g.economy, community planning). The extension of participation rights to segments of thepopulation that did not have these rights before (e.g. blacks, guest-workers) is also part ofthis dimension.Representation:The emphasis is on representative democratic procedures which imply an indirectparticipation of citizens in political decision making. Instead, the role and the functions ofthe elected representatives are stressed. The underlying principle is a procedural model of33democracy. According to this concept, citizen participation should be mainly restricted tovoting, i.e. establishing government majorities. After this, binding decisions are taken bythe elected representatives.The Co-operation vs. Conflict DimensionThis dimension refers to general principles of international relations. It covers bilateralforeign politics as well as the two main international conflicts, namely the East-Westconflict and the North-South conflict. We distinguish two policy positions, conflict and co-operation.Co-operation:The state emphasizes shared interests and joint action with other states. With respect to theEast-West conflict, policies of detente and co-operation are pursued. Strategies are armsreduction or action according to CSCE-procedures. With respect to the North-Southconflict, the necessity of solidarity and international responsibility is being stressed.Conflict:The state emphasizes its own national interests and puts these interests first. In the pursuitof its goals it accepts conflict with other states as a means of politics. Confrontation is acharacteristic state of the Cold War.The Supra-nationalism vs. Sovereignty DimensionThis dimension refers to the specific way relations to other states arc to be organized. Itcenters on the question of whether and to what extent sovereign rights should be delegatedto supranational or international organizations. The most important organizations for thecurrent process of internationalization are the UNO, the NATO, and the EC. The respectivepositions are labelled sovereignty and supra-nationalism.Supra-nationalism:The necessity of international and supranational organizations is emphasized. The state isready to delegate rights from the nation-state to supranational organizations. The rights ofsupranational organizations should be expanded and strenghthened.Sovereignty:The state insists on sovereign rights and endeavours to maintain the structures of a nation-state. There is a resistance to the delegate of rights to supranational organizations, atendency to restrain the power of these organizations, or slow down the process ofinternationalization.New: The Control of New Technologies vs. Acceptance of Risk DimensionThis dimension refers to the conflict regarding “new politics” that mostly evolves aroundenvironmental and human biology issues. It centers on the question how the technologicaldevelopment should be organized and whether and to what extent possible negativeoutcomes of new technologies should be accepted or whether the state should be moresceptical toward new developments. The respective positions are labelled Control of NewTechnologies vs. Acceptance of Risk Dimension.34Control of New Technologies:A preference for control and for the consideration of ecological and social consequences oftechnical developments.Acceptance of Risk:Technological innovation is given priority over the possibility of negative outcomes forecology and society.Veröffentlichungsreihe der Arbeitsgruppe „Politische Öffentlichkeit und Mobilisierung“des Wissenschaftszentrums Berlin für SozialforschungP 01-701P 01-702Die Rolle der Öffentlichkeit im politischen EntscheidungsprozessHanspeter KriesiConflict and Consonance in Media Opinion: Political Positions of fiveGerman Quality NewspapersChristiane EildersBitte die nächste Seite beachten!See the following page, please!Die Arbeitspapiere können bestellt werden/The discussion papers can be ordered:Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin fürSozialforschung (WZB)PressestelleReichpietschufer 50D-10785 BerlinBestellungen von Arbeitspapieren: Briefmarken erbetenWir erbitten von allen Bestellern, die Arbeitspapiere vom WZB anfordern, eine 1 DM-Briefmarke pro Papier als pauschalen Beitrag zu den anfallenden Versandkosten.
