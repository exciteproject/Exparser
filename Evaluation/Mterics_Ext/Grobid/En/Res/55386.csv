The researchers used the questionnaire method to collectdata. The researchers used the random stratified sample method, where 30 samples were distributed to test theinternal consistency, structural validity and consistency of the questionnaire. After verifying the validity andreliability of the questionnaire for the test, (220) questionnaires were distributed to the study community. A total of197 responses were retrieved with a return rate equal to (89.5%).The results showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the averages of the sample of thestudy on these areas and the domains combined due to the variables of (gender), (qualification), (place of work),(years of service), (Job title). The results showed that there were statistically significant differences between themean of the sample of the study on these areas due to age for the benefit of those aged 40 years and over. Theresults confirmed that there are statistically significant differences between the averages of the sample estimates ofthe study on this field due to the nature of the work in favor of those whose nature is administrative. The resultsshowed that there are statistically significant differences between the average of the sample of the study sample onthese two fields due to the years of service in favor of those who have served for 10 years or more.The study reached a number of recommendations including: The need to establish a specialized department ofcomputerized health information systems, with clear responsibilities, and includes technical and administrativespecialists and health personnel in the number and efficiency required, working as a team to implement mechanismsof work in computerized health information systems and have direct contact with staff in clinics and divisions toprovide services and technical support as soon as possible with the best quality. Increase the support provided bysenior management to users by encouraging them to use computerized health information systems andunderstanding their different needs. Interest in providing the material resources of the equipment and equipmentused in the computerized health information system. The need to use database systems in the administrative andmedical decisions in clinics and sections that have an impact in raising the effectiveness of decisions by improvingthe quality.Keywords: Computerized Health Information Systems, Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex, Gaza, Palestine.1. INTRODUCTIONMedical decisions face many challenges and difficulties because the volume of information and knowledge thatdoctors and decision-makers in hospitals and health care centers must deal with on an ongoing basis has grown to apoint where it has become difficult to deal with them in purely traditional ways. Limits the intellectual capacity ofthe human being and increases the analytical and predictive capabilities necessary in decision-making processes,thereby increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of collection, storage, sorting and retrieval of information, andraising the analytical capacity to evaluate and process information and alternatives Different times help to save timeand effort for making different decisions.Computerized health information systems have become a major issue of concern to all managers in healthorganizations. Health information systems and technology have brought distances far beyond human reach, and haveenabled the storage of digital, text, audio and images. This helps to provide information that is very important todecision-makers. Health information systems play an important role in the practical life of health workers. Theywww.ijeais.org80International Journal of Engineering and Information Systems (IJEAIS)ISSN: 2000-000XVol. 1 Issue 9, November – 2017, Pages: 80-104support them in identifying their training needs, continuing education and scientific research, Life, and the mostimportant applications of health information systems are hospital information management systems, telemedicineand medical and administrative decision support systems (Tan, 2005).The hospitals and specialized centers and health centers of the General Administration of Primary Care are the mainprovider of health services to the public of patients and citizens. The General Directorate of Hospitals is responsiblefor organizing the work of hospitals and monitoring the performance and providing the necessary means whileregulating the relationship with other departments in the Ministry of Health and parallel departments. The aim is tointegrate work among all hospitals, distribute competencies and manpower, and provide the service at a decent levelto all citizens by the most accessible means (www.moh.gov.ps).2. PROBLEM STATEMENTThe Ministry of Health is one of the most vital ministries for its services and for the important tasks of citizens suchas hospital administration, treatment of citizens, primary care clinics, disease prevention and other tasks. (Abu Sabt,2005) stressed the need to continue and enhance the development and upgrading of administrative informationsystems, according to modern technological developments, and study of Ahmed (2007), which studied the role ofaccounting information systems in rationalizing administrative decisions in Palestinian business establishments andits emphasis on the need to expand the use of information systems and their role in planning operations andadministrative decisions. The study of (Al-Shurafa, 2004) state that there is a need for planning programs tointroduce medical information systems and benefit from technology.3. RESEARCH QUESTION4.

LITERATURE REVIEWStudy of (Al-Gharabawy, 2014) aimed at identifying computerized health information systems and their relationto job performance. A field study on UNRWA's primary health care centers in the Gaza Strip. The studyreached several results, the most important of which is: Related to the use of computerized health informationsystems, applications of computerized health information systems used, and the level of functional performanceof health center personnel. And the existence of a positive relationship between computerized healthinformation systems and the level of functional performance of workers in health centers.Study of (Abu Kareem, 2013), which aimed to identify the relationship of management information systems inimproving the administrative performance in the NGOs in the Gaza Strip. The study concluded that the devicesare the most information systems that improve administrative performance, the results indicated that the Boardof Directors supervises and sets the policy for the institution. The results revealed that the IT department isresponsible for the equipment for storing the data. There is an agreement by the managers that the respondentscan identify and judge that there is an IT department in the organization. The results showed that the responsefrom the system staff is high and that the response to maintenance by the system staff is high. The equipmentused is currently one of the best and the latest technology available. The results showed that the managementand operation of the databases have the ability to add and modify, and that the management and operation ofdatabases are characterized by the ability to store, the existence of statistically significant differences betweenthe relationships of administrative information systems in improving administrative performance due to variableyears of service.www.ijeais.org82International Journal of Engineering and Information Systems (IJEAIS)ISSN: 2000-000XVol. 1 Issue 9, November – 2017, Pages: 80-104Study of (Al-Dweik, 2010) aimed at determining the implications of the use of computerized health informationsystems on the decision-making processes of the European Gaza Hospital, and determining the differencesbetween these effects on administrative decisions compared to medical decisions. The study also aimed atanalyzing the actual reality of the use of computerized health information systems in various departments andthe effects of using these systems on the fields of administrative and medical work. It also aimed to identify themain obstacles and problems that limit their effectiveness, and identify the most important types of thesesystems in terms of use. The study found that the number of members of the administrative and medical samplewho use computerized health information systems in their work was 121 out of 128 individuals (94.5%). Thedescending order of types of computerized information systems used at the Gaza European Hospital is asfollows: functional information systems, office automation systems, document management, decision supportsystems and top management information systems, messaging systems. The study showed that the computerizedhealth information system currently used in the European Gaza Hospital has a good impact on the fields ofmedical and administrative work as well as medical and administrative decisions. There are differences betweenthe levels of impact of computerized health information systems on administrative decisions compared tomedical decisions and differences in favor of administrative decisions. The study also showed that there areobstacles that limit the effectiveness of health information systems, the most important of which are: weakfunds required, lack of adequate training, lack of vision towards the need for comprehensive planning ofelectronic health applications.Study of (Al-Halabi, 2010) aimed at measuring the appropriateness of computerized information systems andtheir impact on decentralization in the Ministry of Finance in the Gaza Strip. In order to achieve the objectivesof the study, a questionnaire was designed and developed for the purpose of collecting data and measuring studyvariables. The sample consisted of (104) employees, 79 of which were retrieved, and the statistical package(SPSS) was used to perform the statistical analysis of this study using the following statistical methods:descriptive statistics, Siperman correlation coefficient and analysis of variance. The study found that therequirements of computerized administrative information systems (physical, software, human, organizational)are highly efficient from the point of view of the respondents. There is also a statistically significant relationshipbetween the computerized and decentralized administrative information systems in the Ministry of Finance inthe Gaza Strip. The study indicates that there is no statistically significant relationship on "the impact ofcomputerized administrative information systems on decentralization in the Ministry of Finance in the GazaStrip" due to the demographic variables (gender, age, experience, job qualification, scientific level).Study of (Al-Omari, 2009), which aimed to identify the impact of Computerized Information Systems on theperformance of the employees of the Palestinian Telecommunications Company. To achieve the objectives ofthe study, a questionnaire was designed and developed consisting of (60) paragraphs for the purpose ofcollecting data and measuring the variables of the study. The study reached a number of results, the mostimportant of which were: The existence of a statistically significant effect on the operation and managementrequirements of the administrative information systems (physical, software, human, organizational) on theperformance of the employees of the company, Respondents on the subject of the study are attributedDemographic variables (level of the scientific, years of experience, workplace, career level), and the presence ofa good level of physical supplies, and the existence of a good level of human supplies and the presence of agood level of supplies software and the existence of a good level of regulatory requirements.Study of (Arafat, 2007), the study aimed to assess the administrative requirements for the optimal use ofdecision support systems in the ministries of the Palestinian Authority - Gaza. Study population consisted of thelargest two ministries operating in the Gaza Strip (Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health). Thequestionnaire was used as a tool for collecting study data. The study found several results, the most important ofwhich are: There is a need to improve the perception regarding the main administrative areas in thegovernmental sector institutions in the Gaza Strip (Human resources - Organizational and administrativestructure - Managing work processes - Controlling change - Discipline and inadequate human resources systemin sector institutions Governmental organizations in the Gaza Strip) in order to facilitate the optimal use of thedecision support system and the administrative structure of government sector institutions is reasonablyacceptable, and with regard to facilitating the optimal use of decision support systems and OMS, thegovernment sector is reasonably adequate in terms of facilitating the optimal use of decision support anddiscipline systems in government sector institutions, and there are differences in managers' attitudes towardsassessing administrative requirements towards optimal use of decision support systems in relation to age, Inorder to facilitate the optimal use of decision support systems.www.ijeais.org83International Journal of Engineering and Information Systems (IJEAIS)ISSN: 2000-000XVol. 1 Issue 9, November – 2017, Pages: 80-104Study of (Al-Saudi, 2006), the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of Computerized InformationSystems on the performance of employees in the Social Security Institution. Data were distributed to the 369members of the sample. The statistical methods were used to analyze the data. Statistical methods were used todetermine the perceptions of the sample members of the dimensions of information systems and performance,the study model and the effect of independent variables on the dependent variable and the analysis of the singlevariance. The study reached several results, the most important of which are: The perceptions of the respondentsregarding the requirements of operating the information system were high. The respondents' perceptions of thejob performance came to a medium degree. The impact of the main requirements for the management andoperation of the computerized, software, human, and organizational information system in the job performance.The study showed that there are statistically significant differences in respondents' perceptions of therequirements of operating the information system, due to the demographic variables (gender, age, academicqualification, experience, and career level).Study of (Abu Sabt, 2005) which aimed to assess the role of these systems in the decision-making process ofdecision makers in Palestinian universities in the Gaza Strip. The study reached a number of results, the mostimportant of which is that the current information systems do not rise to expert systems where they do notprovide solutions to problems. And not to provide external statistical information and lack of direct contact withthe centers of statistics inside or outside the country. And that they have competence and managerial andtechnical expertise that are very commensurate with the work assigned to them. And that the devices used inuniversities are modern and highly efficient in Palestinian universities. And that there is a positive relationshipbetween the quality of information and the use of information systems in the decision-making process. And thatthe programs used help to the flexible exchange of information among users of the system and the presence ofmodern techniques in the systems used, including technical. And that there is a strong relationship between theorganizational level and the quality of decisions.Study of (Ghoneim, 2004), which aimed to identify the role of Computerized Information Systems in thedecision-making process in the municipalities of the Gaza Strip. The study consisted of (11) municipalities inthe Gaza Strip. The study found several results, the most important of which are: a strong positive relationshipbetween the availability of the computerized management information systems infrastructure and the productionand use of information needed for decision making, the weak ability of the information system to cover aspectsof work including the material potential, the organizational level is suitable for the beneficiaries of the system,The existence of clear plans for the functioning of the computerized administrative information system is amajor obstacle that hinders the implementation and development of administrative information systems in themunicipalities, and recommended the need for infrastructure, including human resources.9. COMPUTERIZED HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMSThe World Health Organization (WHO) defined the computerized health information system as "the science ofacquiring, preserving, retrieving and applying biomedical knowledge and information to improve patient care,education, research and management, as well as the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean" The useof computing, networking and communication technology methodologies to support health-related areas such asmedicine, nursing and management (www.emro.who.int). This definition covers a wide range covering thefollowing areas: conservation, processing, retrieval and exchange of information Administrative and medicaldecisions Support for administrative and medical decisions Save the radiological image analysis and clinical signselectronically Provide scientific models and telemedicine, defined in the Scientific Encyclopedia of InformationSystems As information systems consisting of computer hardware, software, procedures and processes specificallydesigned to collect, process, store and manage information related to health care delivery, in order to supportMedical Management (Wickramasinghe& Geisler, 2008).The health organizations exercise their functions in a specific organizational environment and within a framework ororganizational structure with its characteristics and specifications. Within this regulatory framework, medical,therapeutic, preventive and various administrative aspects that serve the medical and health aspects Jad AL-Rab(2009), Al-Dweik (2010) defined it as a set of elements, procedures and means that record, process, save, retrieveand distribute information to support health care organizations where this information can be divided into healthinformation and management information. "Health information systems in the scientific encyclopedia are defined asinformation systems Consisting of Computer hardware, software, procedures and processes specifically designed tocollect, process, store, and manage information related to health care delivery, to support medical and administrativedecisions (Geisler& Wickramasinghe, 2008). Wager et al. Sub-systems consist of information, processes, people,and IT systems that interact with each other to support a health care organization.www.ijeais.org84International Journal of Engineering and Information Systems (IJEAIS)ISSN: 2000-000XVol. 1 Issue 9, November – 2017, Pages: 80-104Dimensions of computerized health information systems:1. Types of health information systems used:A. Medical Information System (MIS)Jad AL-Rab (2009), is an important subsystem that makes the overall system of the hospital a meaningful social andhuman organization. Therefore, this system affects the overall performance of the hospital, without information thatis not made, and without information, there is no communication the author is not overly efficient. He says thatwithout information, there is no effective organization. The information is the clean blood flowing, which stimulatesthe arteries and veins of multiple and interconnected organizations, and the importance of medical informationsystems in raising the efficiency of medical and organizational performance in health organizations.B. Medical Records Information System and its benefits for health organizations:The concept of JAD AL-Rab (2009) is a concept developed in the field of information systems in general and in thearea of health organization management in particular. It is defined as "one of the integrated information systems ofthe hospital-wide integrated information system Data on the disease as well as on the units and departmentsresponsible for the provision of therapeutic and medical services in the hospital and then tabulation, operation,treatment, storage and retrieval of the data to be used primarily in the decision-making and medical use for thepurposes of legal education and training and guidance of the Medical Authority and My research, medical andadministrative studies in health organizations.2. Equipment and devices used:The devices as defined by (Kundalji and Al-Janabi, 2009) include all the various types of physical components andmedia used in the processes in which the data and information pass. The hardware or hardware does not includecomputers and other devices, but also all the media and visible objects on which data are recorded Pages and piecesof paper to extract information onto magnetic or optical disks.3. The databases usedAl-Najjar (2005) stated that databases are a logical organization of clusters of interconnected files where data areintegrated and inter-related, making it easy to find information to achieve the desired objectives, and data arearranged and stored in a typical way Data avoidance is avoided.4. Networks:The networks include long-range communications and communications technologies, and various types of networks,such as the Internet, intranet, and extranets, which have become important in managing successful e-business andbusiness operations of all kinds, through its Kundalji and Al- Janabi, (2009). Local networks use cables of varioustypes, including dual-channel telephone wires, single or multichannel cable and high-performance fiber optics (Al-Salmi and Al-Salmi, 2005).5. Supporting senior management:The effectiveness of the system depends on the support of the senior management of the organization served by thesystem, whether at the level of data inputs or the level of its policy outputs and without support at the level of eithersystem does not lead (Al-Moghrabi, 2002)6. Users of the system:The availability of human skills and competencies, training, development and motivation is one of the mostimportant pillars for achieving the goals of the institution. Achieving success requires dedicating attention and careto individuals starting with the process of selection, appointment, performance evaluation, training and developmentprograms, and motivational methods to seek to prove the differences in work, participation, For the purpose ofachieving continuous improvement in performance (Hamoud, 2005), system users are the individuals who use thesystem or the information produced by the system (Kundalji and Al-Janabi, 2009). System users can also be definedhere as specialists Technicians: Individuals, who develop, operate and manage the information system technically(Kundalji and Al-Janabi, 2009).10. FIELD STUDYFirst- Methodology of the study:In order to achieve the objectives of the study, the researchers used the descriptive analytical method in which hetries to describe the phenomenon of the subject of the study, analyzing its data, the relationship between itscomponents and the opinions that are raised around it, the processes it contains and the effects it causes.Second- Society and Study Sample:The society of the study is defined as all the vocabulary of the phenomenon studied by the researchers. Based on theproblem of the study and its objectives, the target community consists of the departments and departmentswww.ijeais.org85International Journal of Engineering and Information Systems (IJEAIS)ISSN: 2000-000XVol. 1 Issue 9, November – 2017, Pages: 80-104responsible for the health information systems in the Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex- Gaza (289) administratively.The sample was randomized to a sample of 30 samples to test the internal consistency, structural honesty andstability of the questionnaire. After confirming the validity of the questionnaire, 220 samples were distributed to thestudy population (89.5%).Third: The Study Tool:The instrument of study means that the tool measures what has been set for its measurement. The veracity of thequestionnaire has been verified by the following methods:1. Validity from the point of view of the arbitrators:The questionnaire was presented to a number of specialized arbitrators in order to ascertain the accuracy of thelinguistic language of the questionnaire, the clarity of the instructions of the questionnaire, the affiliation of theparagraphs to the dimensions of the questionnaire and the validity of this tool to measure the objectives associatedwith this study. The arbitrators looked.2. Internal ValidityThe consistency of the internal consistency of each paragraph of the questionnaire with the area in which thisparagraph belongs is true. The researchers calculated the internal consistency of the questionnaire by calculating thecorrelation coefficients between each paragraph of the question domains and the total score of the field itself.Fourthly- Reliability of the study instrument Reliability:The questionnaire is consistently meant to "give the questionnaire the same results if repeated several times.The researchers investigated the stability using Alpha Cronbach's Coefficient equation. The researchers used theAlpha Cronbach method to measure the stability of the questionnaire. The results were as shown in Table 1.Table 1: Alpha Cronbach coefficient to measure the stability of the questionnaireThe FieldEquipment and equipment used.Databases used.Networks.Support senior management.Users of the system.All fields togetherNumber ofparagraphs101098845Alpha Cronbachcoefficient0.8750.7750.7830.8390.7770.949Self-honesty *0.9350.8800.8850.9160.8820.974*Self-honesty = positive quadratic root of the Cronbach alpha factorIt is clear from the results shown in Table (1) that the value of the alpha-cronbach coefficient is high for each field,ranging from (0.775, 0.949) to all the paragraphs of the questionnaire (0.960). As well as the value of self-honesty ishigh for each field, ranging between (0.880.0.974) and reached all the paragraphs of the questionnaire (0.980) thismeans that the coefficient of self-honesty is high.Statistical treatments used:The questionnaire was dumped and analyzed through the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).Normality Distribution Test:The Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test (K-S) was used to test whether or not the data followed normal distribution and theresults were as shown in Table 2.Table 2: Demonstrates the results of the normal distribution testThe FieldEquipment and equipment used.Databases used.Networks.Support senior management.Users of the system.All fields together“Sig.” value0.9870.9420.7060.9780.1620.872It is clear from the results shown in Table (2) that the probability value (Sig) for the fields of study is greater thanthe level of significance (α≤ 0.05). Thus, the distribution of data for these fields follows the natural distribution,where the scientific tests will be used to answer the hypotheses of the study. The following statistical tools wereused: Frequencies & Percentages: To describe the sample of the study.www.ijeais.org86International Journal of Engineering and Information Systems (IJEAIS)ISSN: 2000-000XVol. 1 Issue 9, November – 2017, Pages: 80-104Arithmetic mean and relative arithmetic mean.The Cronbach's Alpha test, to determine the persistence of the paragraphs of the questionnaire.K-S test: Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test to see whether the data follow normal distribution.Pearson Correlation Coefficient to measure the degree of correlation: This test examines the relationshipbetween two variables. It has been used to calculate internal consistency and structural honesty of thequestionnaire, and the relationship between variables.T test in the case of a single T-Test to determine whether the average response has reached the intermediateapproval level (3) or increased or decreased. It has been used to ascertain the mean significance of eachparagraph of the questionnaire.T-Test (Independent Samples T-Test) to see if there are statistically significant differences between two sets ofindependent data.One Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was tested to determine whether there were statistically significantdifferences between three or more sets of data.11.

The researchersattributed this to the fact that the Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex is the main compound in the Gaza Strip and thereare the outpatient departments and the central departments so most of the competencies of human resources arelocated within the compound of Dar Al-Shifa for the great work pressure during the twenty-four hours and sinceboth gender do the same work, On the same requirements of computerized health information systems. As a result,females prefer to work within the primary health care centers and clinics in the regions, and prefer to avoid as far aspossible the places that suffer from work pressure and friction with the public as the society is male dominant, andconservative.www.ijeais.org87International Journal of Engineering and Information Systems (IJEAIS)ISSN: 2000-000XVol. 1 Issue 9, November – 2017, Pages: 80-104And 35.0% of the study sample was under 30 years of age, 32.0% were aged 30-40 years and 22.3% were aged 40-50 years, 10.7% (50 years) and more. The researchers attribute this to the diversity of the average age, whichindicates the availability of expertise. It is also noticed that 79.3% of the study population is less than (50) years old,and this is because the Palestinian society is young and young.(13.7%) have an average diploma, 60.9% have a bachelor's degree, 18.8% hold a master's degree, and 3.6% hold aPhD degree, Where the researchers note from the previous results that (74.6%) of the society of the study of holdersof a bachelor's degree and diploma. The researchers attributed this to the fact that most jobs in Dar Al-Shifa requirea minimum diploma for administrative, medical and medical support, and a bachelor's degree for medical posts.(33.0%) of the study respondents said that the nature of their work is administrative, while (67.0%) the nature oftheir work is a health administration. The researchers attribute this to the fact that Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex isthe largest medical and health center in the Gaza Strip, Central, and drug stores, so it is normal that the majority ofthe study group of health administrators.(12.7%) of the study sample work in outpatient clinics, while 87.3% work in the departments. The researchersattribute that the Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex has the main sections that serve all the citizens of the Gaza Strip.All hospitals in the Gaza Strip, primary care centers, specialized surgeons, and specialist care departments andreferral sections for patients who need clinical care. Outpatient clinics are for patients who complain of variousdiseases in the Gaza Strip.(27.9%) of the sample study years of service less than (5) years, (28.4%), the years of service ranging from (5) toless than (10) years, while (43.7%) years of service (10). The researchers attributed this to the fact that the largestpercentage is for those with experience. The percentage of workers who have more than 5 years of employment is72.1%. This is due to the stability of the labor force provided by the Ministry of Health to its employees. The staff ofthe Palestinian Ministry of Health, which represents their safety compared to private clinics and civil centers.And (7.1%) of the sample of the study named their job title department manager and above, (45.7%) head ofdepartment, (7.6%) administrative head, while (39.6%) their administrative job title, And since the Dar Al-Shifaacomplex is a medical complex, it is natural that the owners of the administrative functions of the medical and healthpersonnel who hold managerial positions are more than the administrative staff.Analysis of question paragraphs:To analyze the resolution paragraphs, a single sample T test was used to determine whether the average responsescore had reached the intermediate approval level (3) or not.Zero Hypothesis: The mean response is equal to (3) and corresponds to the average degree of approval according tothe Likert scale.Alternative Hypothesis: The average response score is not equal to (3).If Sig <0.05 (Sig is greater than 0.05), the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. In this case, the average of theindividuals' opinions on the phenomenon studied is not substantially different from the average degree of approval(3). 0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted that the average views ofindividuals differ substantially from the average approval level (3). In this case, it is possible to determine whetherthe average response substantially increases or decreases the degree of intermediate approval. By means of the valueof the test. If the value of the test is positive, it means that the arithmetic mean of the answer exceeds the degree ofintermediate approval and vice versa.Analysis of paragraphs of the questionnaireFirst: Analysis of the "Types of Computerized Health Information Systems"The frequencies and percentages were used to determine the degree of approval and the results are shown in Table 4.Table 4: Degree of Approval of Each Paragraph of the "Types of Computerized Health Information Systems"1.2.3.4.5.6.Types of Computerized Health Information SystemsDar Al-Shifa Medical Complex has office automation anddocument management systems.Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex has a patient registration system.Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex has medical records systems.Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex has blood bank records systems.Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex has radiation systems.Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex has pharmacy systems.YesNoK16617717913098102%84.389.890.966.049.751.8K312018679995www.ijeais.org%15.710.29.134.050.348.288International Journal of Engineering and Information Systems (IJEAIS)ISSN: 2000-000XVol. 1 Issue 9, November – 2017, Pages: 80-1047.8.9.10.11.12.Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex has laboratory systems.Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex has medical reporting systems.Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex has electronic reporting systems.Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex has internal department systems.Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex has outpatient clinics and anemergency department.Messaging systems such as e-mail and voice mail are available.991351221411675650.368.561.971.684.828.4986275563014149.731.538.128.415.271.6From Table (4), the following can be drawn:Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex- Gaza uses different applications of computerized health information systems.- 84.3% of the sample agreed on the availability of office automation and document management systems at DarAl-Shifa Medical Complex, while the rest (15.7%) disagreed.

Therefore, the area of "senior management support" is not statisticallysignificant at a level of significance (α= 0.05), the degree of response to this area is not significantly differentfrom the average approval level of 3, which means that there is a moderate approval by the sample members inthis field.The researchers note that the senior management is interested in the development of computerized healthinformation systems, encourages the use of computerized health information systems, monitors the work processbased on the use of information systems, provides training programs and special courses related to the use ofcomputerized health information systems, And provide the necessary requirements and financial support to improvethe use of computerized health information systems, provide the necessary cadres to carry out the training processfor their employees, and analyze the problems that face them and prioritize their solution.These findings were agreed with (Al-Otaibi, 2010), which concluded that the Academy's management supports thetransition to the use of information technology for human resources management and the study of (Ramadan, 2009),which showed awareness and awareness among senior management regarding the use of decision support systems.These results differed with some studies such as (Arafat, 2007), which showed that there were differences in theattitudes of managers towards evaluating administrative requirements towards the optimal use of decision supportsystems.Sixth: Analysis of the paragraphs of the "users of the system"The T test was used to determine whether the average response was 3 or not. The results are shown in Table (9).Table 9: The arithmetic mean and the probability value (Sig.) for each of the paragraphs of the "system users"Ranking1243687594No.1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.ItemEmployees in existing systems have the ability toadapt to business requirements.Responding to the requirements of beneficiariesby high-system employees.Maintenance and guidance for beneficiaries byhigh system employees.Human cadres possess the necessary skills tooperate and maintain computerized informationsystems.The department concerned with thecomputerized systems shall abide by what isstated in the prescribed time.The Computer Systems Department provides thesame level of services at all times.Employees in the Department of ComputerSystems and System Users participate in systemdesign and development.Users are well qualified to use the network.All paragraphs of the field togetherSMA3.483.153.143.153.092.922.933.133.12Relativearithmeticmean69.5963.0862.8762.9061.8858.3658.6762.6762.48Testvalue5.662.011.771.891.16-0.98-0.761.512.30“Sig.”value*0.000*0.023*0.039*0.0300.1230.1630.2240.066*0.011* The arithmetic average is statistically significant at the level of significance (α= 0.05).From Table (9) we can draw the following:- The arithmetic average of the first paragraph "the workers in existing systems have the ability to adapt tobusiness requirements" equals 3.48 (the total score of 5), i.e. the relative arithmetic average is 69.59%, the testvalue is 5.66 and the probability value (Sig) is 0.000. Therefore, this paragraph is considered statisticallysignificant at a level of significance (α= 0.05) indicating that the average response rate for this paragraph haswww.ijeais.orgInternational Journal of Engineering and Information Systems (IJEAIS)ISSN: 2000-000XVol. 1 Issue 9, November – 2017, Pages: 80-104exceeded the average approval level of 3, which means that there is considerable agreement by the samplemembers on this paragraph.- The computational average of the sixth paragraph "The computer systems section provides the same level ofservices at all times" equals 2.92, ie, the relative arithmetic mean is 58.36%, the test value is -0.98 and theprobability value (Sig) is 0.163, so this is not statistically significant at the level of significance (α= 0.05)indicating that the average response rate for this paragraph is not significantly different from the averageapproval level of 3, which means that there is a moderate approval by the respondents on this paragraph.- In general, the arithmetic mean is 3.12, the relative arithmetic average is 62.48%, the test value is 2.30, and theprobability value (Sig) is 0.011. Therefore, the "system users" field is statistically significant at a level ofsignificance (α= 0.05). This area differs substantially from the average approval level of 3, which means thatthere is considerable agreement by the sample members on the paragraphs of this area.The researchers attributed this to the existence of the administration responsible for the computerized health systemat the Dar Al-Shifa Health Complex in Gaza, and the opinion of the members of the community that the workers inthe existing systems have the ability to adapt to the requirements of the work, Human cadres have the skills tooperate and maintain computerized information systems.These results were agreed with some studies such as Abu Kareem (2013), which found that the response by the staffin the systems is high, and the study (Al-Omari, 2009), which found a good level of human inputs, and study(Ammar, 2009) (2009), which showed the existence of human potential to a good degree, and study (Al-Saudi,2006), which reached to the existence of the impact of the main requirements for the management and operation ofcomputerized information system and software, human and organizational performance, and study of (Abu Sabt,2005), which showed that there is a diversity of disciplines working in decision-support systems and that they haveefficient administrative and technical expertise commensurate significantly with assigned business to them.These results differed with some studies such as Arafat (2007), which showed the inadequacy of the humanresources system in the governmental sector in the Gaza Strip, and Ghoneim (2004), which recommended theavailability of infrastructure, including human resources.Analysis of all paragraphs of the first axis "computerized health information systems"The T test was used to determine whether the average response was 3 or not. The results are shown in Table 10.Table 10: The arithmetic mean and the probability value (Sig) of all the sections of "computerized healthinformation systems"The Fieldcomputerized health information systemsSMA3.10Relativearithmeticmean62.06Test value“Sig.” value2.29*0.012* The arithmetic average is statistically significant at the level of significance (α= 0.05).Table (10) shows that the arithmetic average of all the first axes is 3.10 (the total score of 5), ie, the relativearithmetic average is 62.06%, the test value is 2.29, and the probability value (Sig) is 0.012. Therefore, the first axisclauses are statistically significant Indicating that the average response rate has exceeded the average approval level,which is 3. This means that there is a great deal of agreement by the sample members on the first axis in general.The researchers attribute this to the work carried out by employees of Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex Based mainlyon the different applications of health information systems the ratio, the higher the efficiency of computerized healthinformation systems led to improved performance of the administrative staff level.These results were agreed with (Al-Gharabawy, 2014), which found a high degree of approval for the use ofcomputerized health information systems applications and the level of performance of health center staff. (AL-Arabi, 2012), which confirmed the existence of a statistically significant relationship between the use of informationtechnology and the performance of the employees, and the study (Al-Otaibi, 2010), which reached There is clarity inthe study sample of the importance of the use of information technology in the management of human resources, andthe study (Al-Bashaabsha, 2005), which found a significant impact of the quality of management informationsystems in raising the level of performance.These results differed with some studies such as AL-Arabi (2012), which showed no statistically significantrelationship between the use of information technology and the speed of achievement, and Al-Dweik (2010), whichconcluded that there are constraints that limit the effectiveness of health information systems.www.ijeais.org95International Journal of Engineering and Information Systems (IJEAIS)ISSN: 2000-000XVol. 1 Issue 9, November – 2017, Pages: 80-104Test hypothesis studyH01: There were statistically significant differences between the responses of the respondents at the level ofsignificance (α ≤0.05) on the reality of computerized health information systems due to the demographic variables(gender, age, academic qualification, nature of work, place of work, years of service, job title) Medical - GazaThe T-test of two independent samples was used to determine whether there were statistically significantdifferences, a teacher's test to compare two sets of data.
