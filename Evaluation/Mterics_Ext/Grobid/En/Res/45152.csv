Such usually vague and ill-defined claims reflect sport’smarginal policy status and its attempts to prove its more general relevance. The dominance of evangelical beliefs andinterest groups, who tend to view research in terms of affirmation of their beliefs, is restricting conceptual and meth-odological development of policy and practice. There is a need to de-reify “sport” and to address the issue of sufficientconditions—the mechanisms, processes and experiences which might produce positive impacts for some participants.This requires researchers and practitioners to develop approaches based on robust and systematic programme theo-ries. However, even if systematic and robust evidence is produced for the relative effectiveness of certain types of pro-gramme, we are left with the problem of displacement of scope—the process of wrongly generalising micro level (pro-gramme) effects to the macro (social). Although programme rhetoric frequently claims to address social issues mostprogrammes have an inevitably individualist perspective. Further, as participation in sport is closely related to sociallystructured inequalities, it might be that rather than sport contributing to “social inclusion”, various aspects of social in-clusion may precede such participation. In this regard academics and researchers need to adopt a degree of scepticismand to reflect critically on what we and, most especially, others might already know. There is a need to theorise sport-for-change’s limitations as well as its “potential”.Keywordsdisplacement of scope; programme theory; scepticism; sport-for-changeIssueThis commentary is part of the special issue “Sport for Social Inclusion: Critical Analyses and Future Challenges”, editedby Dr. Reinhard Haudenhuyse (Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium) and Professor Marc Theeboom (Vrije UniversiteitBrussel, Belgium)© 2015 by the author; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).

Inflated and Vague PromisesDespite claims that sport-for-development or sport-for-change is “new”, the historic rationale for investmentin sport has consistently been based on supposed ex-ternalities—sport’s presumed ability to teach “lessonsfor life”, to contribute to “character building” (Presi-dent’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, 2006)and its supposed ability to contribute to the reduction ofa variety of social problems. Sport’s attraction for policymakers has been a perception that it can offer an econ-omy of remedies to seemingly intractable social prob-lems (e.g., crime, “social inclusion”, “development”).Social Inclusion, 2015, Volume 3, Issue 3, Pages 19-23Despite the absence of systematic, robust support-ive evidence (Coalter, 2007; President’s Council onPhysical Fitness and Sports, 2006), sports evangelistshave made wide-ranging, if rather vague and ill-defined, claims about sport’s capacity to address issuesof personal and social development. In part this re-flects Weiss’s (1993) contention that inflated promisesare most likely to occur in marginal policy areas whichare seeking to gain legitimacy and funding from main-stream agencies. For example, Houlihan and White(2002) contend that sport tends to be opportunisticand reactive—a policy taker and not a policy maker. Insuch circumstances “holders of diverse values and dif-19ferent interests have to be won over, and in the pro-cess a host of inflated and unrealistic goal commit-ments are made” (Weiss, 1993, p. 96).These processes were given a major boost by twobroad shifts in social policy in the late 1990s. Firstly,starting in the UK, but soon spreading worldwide(Bloom, Grant, & Watt, 2005; The Australian SportsCommission, 2006), was a shift from the traditional wel-fare approach of developing sport in the community, toseeking to develop communities through sport (Coalter,2007) as sport promoted itself as being able to contrib-ute to the new, ill-defined, “social inclusion” agenda.The second opportunity arose with the United Na-tions’ embrace of sport to support the achievement ofthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Like theconcept of social inclusion, the MDGs shifted the focusof investment from economic capital to social capital,with a focus on personal and “social inclusion” issues—strengthening education, improving community safetyand social cohesion, helping girls and women andyouth at risk and addressing issues of public health (in-cluding HIV and AIDS) (Kidd, 2008). Such people-centred objectives resonated with many of sport’s tra-ditional claims about contributing to personal and socialdevelopment. However, as with social inclusion, theconcept of sport-for-development remains “intriguinglyvague and open for several interpretations” (Kruse,2006, p. 8).Kruse’s comment indicates that, despite sport’snew opportunities (and its opportunism), there are anumber of unresolved issues with the assertions madeby the conceptual entrepreneurs of sport-for-change.For example, Coakley (2011, p. 307) argues much ofthe rhetoric of sports evangelists can be viewed as“unquestioned beliefs grounded in wishful thinking”.Hartmann and Kwauk (2011, pp. 285-286) refer to “an-ecdotal evidence, beliefs about the impact of sport insound bites of individual and community transfor-mation, packaged and delivered more often than notby those running the programs”.2. From Faith to TheoryFirstly, the presumed developmental impacts and out-comes of such programmes tend to be vague, ill-defined and lack the clarity and intellectual coherencethat evaluation criteria should have. There is a generalconceptual weakness, with a widespread failure to of-fer precise definitions of “sport”; a failure to considerthe nature, extent and duration of participation toachieve presumed impacts; the precise nature of indi-vidual impacts (i.e., the effect of sport on participants)and the nature of their presumed causal relationshipwith outcomes (the resulting individual behaviourchange). Such variety and lack of precision raise sub-stantial issues of validity and comparability and reducegreatly the possibility of cumulative research findings.Social Inclusion, 2015, Volume 3, Issue 3, Pages 19-23This conceptual imprecision is accompanied bymethodological weaknesses. It must be admitted thereare generic methodological difficulties in defining andmeasuring the impacts and outcomes of many socialinterventions and attributing cause and effect in anysimple and straightforward way. However, such basicissues of social science methods are often ignored, es-pecially by the evangelists. In part this is because someview research in terms of affirmation rather than un-derstanding or critique. In the words of Johan Koss,President of Right to Play, “we invite people to do re-search into things like sport and development, sportand peace. We need to prove what we say that we do”(van Kampen, 2003, p. 15). Or, UNICEF (2006, p. 1) ar-guing that there was “a shared belief in the power ofsport-for-development [and] a shared determination tofind ways to document and objectively verify the posi-tive impact of sport”.These beliefs exist despite the existence of an ex-tensive body of sport and related research which raisesfundamental questions about the validity of the overlygeneralised assertions about sport’s capacity toachieve certain developmental impacts (Coalter, 2007).It is significant that such research is frequently ignoredon the basis of the spurious, legitimating, claim thatthis is a “new” area of policy and practice.More fundamentally and related to the lack of clari-ty is the issue of sufficient conditions. Participation in“sport”, however defined and however provided, is anecessary but not sufficient condition to obtain anysupposed benefits. In this regard Coakley (1998, p. 2)argues that we need to regard “sports as sites for so-cialisation experiences, not causes of socialisation out-comes” and Hartmann (2003, p. 134) argues that “thesuccess of any sports-based social intervention pro-gram is largely determined by the strength of its non-sport components”. It might be argued that the wide-spread use of sport plus approaches (Coalter, 2007) in-dicates a recognition of the developmental limits of“sport”. Consequently, there is a need for more sys-tematic, analytical information about the variousmechanisms, processes and experiences associatedwith participation in “sport”. We require a better un-derstanding about what sports and sports’ processes,produce what impacts, for which participants and inwhat circumstances. One possible approach to such is-sues is provided by a theory of change (Granger, 1998),or programme theory (Coalter, 2013a; Pawson, 2006;Weiss, 1997).A programme theory seeks to identify the compo-nents, mechanisms, relationships and sequences ofcauses and effects which programme providers presumelead to desired impacts and outcomes—a theory of val-ue, attitude and behaviour change. It seeks to under-stand the nature of sufficient conditions—the processesand experiences necessary to maximise the potential toachieve desired impacts. Such an approach:20 Assists in the formulation of theoretically coher-ent, realistic and precise impacts related to pro-gramme processes and participants; Enables the identification of critical success fac-tors enabling a more informed approach to pro-gramme design and management; Explores potentially generic mechanisms, thusproviding a basis for generalisation in order to in-form future programme design.3. Displacement of Scope and Structural InequalitiesHowever, even if systematic and robust evidence isproduced for the relative effectiveness of certain typesof programme, even if we can identify the genericmechanisms which enable some programmes to con-tribute to the personal development of some partici-pants (Coalter, 2013b; Pawson, 2006), we are left withthe problem of displacement of scope (Wagner, 1964).This refers to the process of wrongly generalising microlevel (programme) effects to the macro (social). This inpart relates to old debates within social science aboutthe relationship between the individual and the social,or even between values, attitudes, intentions and be-haviour.Although programme rhetoric frequently claims toaddress social issues—crime, social exclusion, “devel-opment”—most programmes have an essentially, andinevitably, individualist perspective. Weiss (1993, p.103) suggests that many social interventions fail be-cause they are “fragmented, one-service-at-a-timeprograms, dissociated from people’s total patterns ofliving”. Further, Weiss’s (1993, p. 105) more generalcomment about social policy interventions and their“blame the victim” perspectives can be viewed withinthe context of sport-for-change programmes:We mount limited-focus programs to cope withbroad-gauge problems. We devote limited re-sources to long-standing and stubborn problems.Above all we concentrate attention on changing theattitudes and behaviour of target groups withoutconcomitant attention to the institutional struc-tures and social arrangements that tend to keepthem “target groups”.In relation to such structural issues the work of Wil-kinson and Pickett (2009) raises even more fundamentalissues. Their core argument relates to the central im-portance of the relative inequality of income and lowlevels of social mobility in explaining a range of socialproblems. Their data illustrate that many of the prob-lems commonly associated with social exclusion (andto which sport offers solutions)—crime, obesity, poorgeneral health, poor educational performance, weakcommunity cohesion—are strongly correlated with so-Social Inclusion, 2015, Volume 3, Issue 3, Pages 19-23cietal levels of relative inequality, with more equalcountries having much lower levels of such problems.Further, it is clear that sports participation is related tostructural issues underpinning social inclusion. For exam-ple, van Bottenburg, Rijnen, & van Sterkenburg (2005)illustrate that the level of educational achievement isthe most important determinant of sports behaviour.Also given the very strong relationship between socialclass and educational opportunity, it is not surprisingthat there is a strong relationship between social classand sports participation. Also, the level of femalesports participation is clearly strongly correlated withthe relative status of women in society (Coalter, 2013c;van Bottenburg et al., 2005)—one which is closely re-lated to levels on inequality.Such consistent relationships between social struc-ture and sports participation have led one major inter-national review of the effectiveness of sports policy in-terventions (Nicholson, Hoye & Houlihan, 2011, p. 305)to conclude that:It is evident…that government policies designed toincrease sports participation have had limited suc-cess….Some have had success…within small com-munities or specific cohorts…[but] the same level ofsuccess has not been apparent within the masspopulation….It is also clear that governments andresearchers don’t know enough about the way inwhich complex systems of organisations function toeither induce or disrupt sports participation pat-terns.Such persistent differentials raise important issues forpolicies of ‘sport and social inclusion’, whose success de-pends on achieving the necessary condition of increasedparticipation in sport by many socially marginal and con-sistently “under-participating” groups. In this regard vanBottenburg et al. (2005, p. 208) raise significant ques-tions about using sport to address social issues via anindividualistic perspective, by arguing that exercise andsport are thoroughly social phenomena and that “thechoice to take part in sport, how, where, what and withwhom is directly related to the issue of how people seeand wish to present themselves…socio-culturally de-termined views and expectations also play a role here”.The broad conclusion to be drawn from the aboveanalyses is to reverse the current fashion for arguingthat sport can contribute to increased “social inclusion”and suggests that various aspects of social inclusionprecede such participation. Further, even if sport pro-vides some degree of individual amelioration for someof these problems, Wilkinson and Pickett (2009, p. 26)offer a salutary warning about neo-Liberal, individual-ized approaches to such problems:Even when the various services are successful instopping someone reoffending…getting someone21off drugs or dealing with educational failure, weknow that our societies are endlessly re-creatingthese problems in each new generation.4. A Need for ScepticismBlack (2010, p. 122) argues that the recent expansion ofsport-for-development policy and practice has not beenunderpinned by “critical and theoretically-informed re-flection” and others have suggested that there is a needto step back and to reflect critically on what we and,most especially, others might already know (Coakley,2011; Crabbe, 2008; Tacon, 2007). In this regard Portes(2000, p. 4) argues that “gaps between received theoryand actual reality have been so consistent as to institu-tionalize a disciplinary skepticism in sociology againstsweeping statements, no matter from what ideologicalquarter they come”. The need for scepticism is nowheremore relevant than in the area of sport-for-change. Suchan approach can contribute to the intellectual and prac-tical development of sport-for-development by placing itwithin a much wider world of knowledge and researchand by theorising its limitations as well as outlining its“potential”.Conflict of InterestsThe author declares no conflict of interests.ReferencesAustralian Sports Commission.
