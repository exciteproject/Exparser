This dialogical perspective proposes a reflexivetool, the hermeneutical locus, which is intended to provide a way to assess the subjectivity of thecognised without falling into reification and a reflexive archaeology of the discipline of IR itself. Inthis sense, a dialogical approach wishes to offer a reflexive tool for and on IR theory.Table of Contents1. Introduction4. ConclusionAcknowledgementsReferencesAuthorCitation1. Introduction2. International Relations Theory, the Question of the Identity-Alterity Nexus, and the DialogicalApproach of International Relations3. The Hermeneutical Locus as a Reflexive Tool for and on International Relations TheoryThe general theme of this FQS special issue on reflexivity and subjectivity is ofgreat interest and significance in social sciences today and more particularly inthe field of International Relations (IR). IR is the field of study that attempts tounderstand and/or explain interactions between state-based and/or non state-based actors on a level that is not limited to the domestic realm and which isoften termed "international politics". In IR the traditional positivist perspective hasproved either to be a failure in its pretensions to provide the only theoretical andscientific framework for social sciences or it has shown its limits as an epistemicresearch programme (see LAKATOS 1970). In IR theory, the struggle during thelate eighties and early nineties against the dominant positivist researchprogrammes resulted in the emergence, among other currents, of a "middleground" meta-theory known as constructivism. This emergence lead to areflection in the discipline which specifically tackled not only the ontological, butmore specifically the epistemological and axiomatical dimensions of the differentIR research programmes (ADLER 1997; LAPID 1989). [1]The main aim of this article is to provide a reflection on the meaning to give toreflexivity and subjectivity when one discuss IR theory according to a specificpositive heuristic of the constructivist programme, that of dialogism (GUILLAUME<ref>© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung / Forum: Qualitative Social Research (ISSN 1438-5627)FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theory2002). Throughout the text, except when specified, I will adopt Mats ALVESSONand Kaj SKÖLDBERG's (2000, p.5) definition of reflexivity as a conscious and</ref>continuous attention to "the way different kinds of linguistic, social, political andtheoretical elements are woven together in the process of knowledgedevelopment, during which empirical material is constructed, interpreted andwritten". The interconnected notion of subjectivity designates, in turn, the qualityof either the cognised or the cognisant agents within the scientific framework ineach dimensions of their interrelations. A dialogical perspective, inspired byMikhail M. BAKHTIN's work, thus wishes to provide an epistemic framework tothe relations cognisant and cognised subjects entertain together in each level oftheir interactions. [2]Reflexivity and subjectivity are in effect fundamental problematics to thosewishing to design social sciences beyond the positivist standpoint as far as thelatter only recognised reflexivity in the sole consciousness of the cognisant to hiswork. Furthermore, the positivist standpoint categorically refused to fully considerthe problem of subjectivity, especially that of the cognised. The real challenge,however, resides in the articulation of a coherent relation between the twoelements within a research programme, trying thus to integrate them in a scien-tific framework (i.e. a project aimed at constituting and constructing knowledge)without falling into the recurrent problems of a "relational theory of reference",such as postmodernism, which, in the words of Alexander WENDT (1999,pp.56-57, original emphasis),"cannot account for the resistance of the world to certain representations, and thusfor representational failure or misinterpretations. [...] The external world to which weostensibly lack access, in other words, often frustrates or penalizes representations.Postmodernism gives us no insight into why this is so, and indeed, rejects thequestion altogether." [3]Dialogism represents an answer to WENDT's challenge for "a theory that takesaccount of the contribution of mind and language yet is anchored to externalreality", as it proposes a form of relational perspective which soundly integratesthis "external reality". This type of perspective, as underlined by MustafaEMIRBAYER (1997, pp.287-288, my emphasis), effectively"derive[s] the meaning, significance, and identity [of the cognised] from the(changing) functional roles they play within that transaction [i.e. relationality]. Thelatter, seen as a dynamic, unfolding process [e.g. a dialogue], becomes the primaryunit of analysis rather than the constituent elements themselves." [4]These dimensions are furthermore "inseparable from the [relational] contextswithin which they are embedded", or, in other words, in the external realitymissing in WENDT's account of relational perspectives. By anchoring anunderstanding of international relations through a relational perspective of thecognised, dialogism provides a way to articulate the notions of reflexivity andsubjectivity that are necessarily linked to a sound consideration of the cognisedself-understanding/perception and its relationality to other cognised (see© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations TheoryBRUBAKER & COOPER 2000). Moreover, reflexivity and subjectivity are anactual problematic as they are related to both cognised and cognisant agents(whether individually or collectively) in the three different levels constituting thescientific framework. This essay therefore wishes to address these three followinglevels: (i) the level of the cognised "objects" (we will see that this term itself isquestionable) in their subjective interrelations as agents within political, social,economical, and historical structures; (ii) the level of the scientific research itself,the reflexive and subjective relations the cognisant "subject" entertains with thecognised "object"; (iii) the level of the reflexive and intersubjective interactionsbetween cognisant "subjects". Dialogism, as we will see, precisely offers a modelto understand or, at least, problematise each levels either within their owndimensions or in their interrelating ones. [5]In order to bring about this threefold connection, I will first discuss the traditionalpositivist frame adopted by most IR scholars and situate the notions of reflexivityand subjectivity in relation to it. This will lead me to tackle the first level mentionedabove and call attention to the subjective quality of the cognised, especially whenthe latter is problematised as an identity. I will then introduce the foundation of adialogical approach in IR which specifically attempts to integrate the notion ofidentity as a specific factor in international relations while embodying the notionsof reflexivity and subjectivity at the core of its epistemological concerns notably byunderlining the transgredient character between identity and alterity. In thesecond section, I will introduce the two other levels of the scientific inquiry bystressing the need to develop a processual/relational approach of IR theory inorder to avoid as much as possible the risk of reification existing in the passagefrom the first to the second level and to conduct a reflexive assessment of one'sown discipline, such as IR theory, by considering it as a site of cultural practice.Dialogism is thus presented as a reflexive tool for and on IR theory, through thehermeneutical locus it creates, with all its epistemological consequences either inthe relations the cognisant entertains toward the cognised or the cognisanttoward other cognisant. [6]2. International Relations Theory, the Question of the Identity-AlterityNexus, and the Dialogical Approach of International RelationsTraditionally, IR theory only focalised on the two main factors (interest and power)that were deemed to causally explain what was considered to be at the core ofthe discipline: war and peace. Up to the end of the 1980s, the main trend withinIR theory was to address these factors within a positivist frame regarding naturalsciences as the way to follow if one wanted to do "real" science. Contrary to mostsocial sciences, IR only lately fully integrated another possible "explanatory"factor—identity—to its general theoretical framework, finally avoiding it anddismissing it as secondary as it used to within traditional perspectives. Thisemergence, as illustrated in several contributions (see for instance LAPID &KRATOCHWIL 1996; KATZENSTEIN 1996), partly enabled IR scholars to rethinkthe epistemological and methodological dimensions of their field by stressing outmore saliently the question of identity, without actually threatening the moretraditional approaches, thus reconsidering a usually unproblematised element of© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations TheoryIR theory: the ways to assess the object of study. This section will first presentthe traditional developments in IR concerning the notions of subjectivity andreflexivity and then introduce dialogism as an alternative perspective for IR toapproach both these notions in function of a specific factor, identity, and the threedimensions characterising the scientific inquiry. [7]As mentioned, IR theory for long has been based upon a perspective that onlyinterest and power were at the heart of any explanation, or even understanding,of the international world. This foundation is the result of a disciplinary "debate" inIR between the so-called "idealists" and the emerging "realists" during theinterwar period. As the (realist) naming suggests (see CARR 1939), the formerswere deemed to provide a normative, utopian, ought-to-be perspective on worldpolitics, based on the ground that ideas/norms were at the heart of internationalrelations (e.g. WILSON's fourteen points1). The latter, however, were depicted, ina debate that was mainly constructed by them (see THIES 2002), as providing a"realist" and "objective" perspective on world politics, taken the international worldas it is in its anarchic and conflictual dimensions and not as the "idealists" wishedit could be, a non "zero-sum" game in which conflicting national interests can beresolve through the rule of law (see BROWN 2001, pp.21-30). In his definition ofpolitical realism, Hans J. MORGENTHAU (1967, p.4, my emphasis), the foundingfather of post-war realism, synthesised what was at stake in the development ofthe discipline at that time and the subsequent basic epistemological driving lineswhich were to be adopted by most IR scholars since then, whether "realist" or not."Political realism believes that politics, like society in general, is governed byobjective laws that have their roots in human nature. In order to improve society it isfirst necessary to understand the laws by which society lives. The operation of theselaws being impervious to our preferences, men will challenge them only at the risk offailure. Realism [...] must also believe in the possibility of developing a rational theorythat reflects, however imperfectly and one-sidedly, these objective laws. It believesalso, then, in the possibility of distinguishing in politics between truth and opinion—between what is true objectively and rationally, supported by evidence and illuminatedby reason, and what is only a subjective judgment, divorced from the facts as theyare and informed by prejudice and wishful thinking." [8]According to MORGENTHAU, then, all IR scholar should follow a positivist-empiricist perspective according to which the objects cognised are metaphysicallydetached from their linguistic and theoretical assessment by the cognisant. Whatmatters for such a perspective is the correspondence between the signifiers usedby the cognisant and the referents, objectively rendered by the signifiers, deemedto be existing independently from the formers. Observation, experimentation,falsidical testing and the judgement of history are among the many ways by whichtheories can be measured as correspondent to the truth of external reality. Thismonistic metaphysic implies that as there is one world "out there", there can onlybe one true (scientific) perspective corresponding to this sole reality (see1 President Woodrow WILSON's fourteen points justified ideologically the US entry in WWI. It is aclassical illustration of an ought-to-be perspective in IR.© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations TheorySPEGELE 1996, pp.48-49). The notion of interest provides, in turn, the con-ceptual link between both worlds. To refer to MORGENTHAU (1967, p.5) again,"The main signpost that helps political realism to find its way through the landscape ofinternational politics is the concept of interest defined in terms of power. This conceptprovides the link between reason trying to understand international politics and thefacts to be understood. [...] We assume that statesmen think and act in terms ofinterests defined as power, and the evidence of history bears that assumption out.[...] Thinking in terms of interest defined as power, we think as [the statesman] does,and as disinterested observers we understand his thoughts and actions perhapsbetter that he [...] does himself. The concept of interest defined as power imposesintellectual discipline upon the observer, infuses rational order into the subject matterof politics, and this makes the theoretical understanding of politics possible." [9]From its realist birth then, the discipline of IR has been trying to reach a"scientific", and thus honourable, status within social sciences, a drive that wasmainly and until quite recently embodied in the attempt to do and be as "realscience" does and is. By "real science" it was usually and effortlessly meantnatural sciences and their positivist/rationalist approach in addition to a tendencyto only adopt quantitative and/or formal methods. Far from rejecting a priori any"positivist" approach in IR, I support that IR theory should not bluntly strive toattain a "positivist" and thus "scientific" status by focalising on what might well bean aporia for many aspects of international relations. Social sciences cannotbecome like the natural sciences even though they might well be inspiredmethodologically by them. "Positivist" approaches to international relations havein effect proved to be feasible, necessary and, often, relevant. Recent analysis offundamental topics such as war or national identity, however, showed that thereis a demand for different and/or complementary approaches as Erik RINGMAR(1996) and Rodney B. HALL (1999) underlined in their recent books whichfocused on this other fundamental factor of international relations: identity. If thepositivist quest thus was highly understandable, it missed, however, one simple,yet major, flaw in such a drive: natural sciences do not deal with self-consciousand reflexive subjects.2 [10]We can now sort out what are the traditional places held by the notions ofsubjectivity and reflexivity within IR following MORGENTHAU's statements,perfectly reflecting the three tenets of positivism which remains the mainconscious or unconscious epistemic framework used by IR scholars (seeNEUFELD 1995, pp.22-38). The first tenet is that of "truth as correspondence"which affirms the validity of positive knowledge by its objective correspondence tothe external and observable world. What is at stake here is the assumedseparation between the cognised (the object, the external reality) and thecognisant (the subject). The notion of objectivity, following MORGENTHAU andmost of the "positivist" literature in IR, refers here to one of its possibledefinitions: the "quality of what exist independently of any knowledge or idea"2 It might be arguable, however, that small parts of the natural sciences (in its mostencompassing acceptation) deal with self-conscious and reflexive subjects (such as theprimatologists with the pigmy chimps Bonobo for instance).© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theory(NADEAU 1999, p.451). The second tenet is also linked to the idea of objectivitybut in its definition as "the quality of one who sees things the way they are withoutbeing influenced by its preferences or habits" (NADEAU 1999, p.451). In the ideaof the value-free nature of scientific knowledge resides the objective quality of thecognisant in its capability to discipline, to discern and to separate what the factsare from the values, and the realm of the object from its subjective world. Thesecharacterisations of the notion of objectivity are, in turn, to be linked to the thirdtenet of positivism, the idea of the methodological unity of science which considerthat the approaches developed to make sense of the natural world areappropriate to address the social world as its fundamental nature, a realm ofobject, is not essentially different from the former. In sum, within a positivistscenario, the two definitions of objectivity are encompassing the notions ofsubjectivity and reflexivity. Subjectivity, for instance, is understood as defining thenatural relation the cognisant entertains with the cognised, the aim of the formerbeing to transcend his subjectivity to reach an objective mode of relation to thelatter. As the cognised is an object, the only subject of science, the cognisant,has to be objective. In this sense, the cognisant has to be reflexive to thecognised to the extent the cognisant has to discipline his relation to the latter inorder for it to reach an objective, value-free, status. Subjectivity and reflexivity arethus subsumed into the two definitions of objectivity as mentioned before. [11]This positivist understanding of the concepts of subjectivity and reflexivity ishighly embedded in the epistemological developments within natural sciencesand unfortunately is rather poor for the social sciences if bluntly translated. Ineffect, social sciences, as part of the humanities, study human consciousness asa subject (whether individually or collectively) of a material world within which itconstructs a social, intersubjective world (GUZZINI 2000, p.164) by theinterweaving of what BAKHTIN (1986b) would call texts, that is all the activities bywhich human beings are "readable". A text, in the BAKHTINian sense,encompasses both narrative and behavioural "documents", which should not beunderstood as an exclusive choice, in the humanities, to the sole discourseanalysis or hermeneutical perspectives. The aim of social sciences is to read thedifferent texts of human activities, that the cognised produces whetherconsciously or not, through different lenses (the diverse sub-fields of socialsciences) and a diversity of approaches (positivist, structuralist, systemist,dialogical, etc.). To reframe this argument in BAKHTIN's words (1986c, p.161),natural sciences are monological while social sciences are dialogical in regards totheir "object" of studies. Natural sciences necessarily and naturally possess whatBAKHTIN calls an "epistemological consciousness" which is "a unitary andunique consciousness"."Everything this consciousness deals with must be determined by itself alone: anydeterminateness must be derived from itself and any determination of an object mustbe performed by itself. In this sense, epistemological consciousness cannot haveanother consciousness outside itself, cannot enter into relation with anotherconsciousness, one that is autonomous and distinct from it. Any unity is its own unity;it cannot admit next to itself any other unity that would be different from it andindependent of it (the unity of nature, the unity of another consciousness), that is, any© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theorysovereign unity that would stand over against it with its own fate, one not determinedby epistemological consciousness. This unitary consciousness creates and forms anymatter it deals with solely as an object and not as a subiectum, and even a subiectumis no more than an object for it. The subiectum is known and understood only as anobject, for only valuation could render him a subiectum—the bearer of his ownautonomous life, experiencing his own fate" (BAKHTIN 1990, pp.88-89). [12]The humanities on the contrary have to take into account the subiectum becausethey possess the "specific task of establishing, transmitting and interpreting thewords of others" (BAKHTIN 1981, p.351). Natural sciences are the only subject,the only intellect, at work cognising and speaking about an object which isnecessarily voiceless. To give a voice to the cognised, it is then important insocial sciences to consider the cognised as a subject and to try to adapt ourepistemology to this fundamental consideration. In review then, social sciencesare oriented towards the reflexive interconnection of at least two subjects, that ofthe cognisant and that of the cognised. The fact that the cognised is regarded asan "object" in the positivist sense is as much an epistemic choice as it is to regardthe cognised as a "subject" in the dialogical sense. However, the dialogicalperspective tries to problematise the inherent subjective quality of the cognised.To quote BAKHTIN (1986d, p.144) again"Sciences of the spirit [i.e. the humanities]; their field of inquiry is not one but two'spirits' (the studied and the person who studies, which must not be merged into onespirit). The real object of study is the interrelation and interaction of 'spirits'." [13]In order to address these different elements by focalising on the question ofidentity and identity formation, I will hereby elaborate a dialogical perspective,grounded on Mikhail Mikhailovitch BAKHTIN's works. The widespread interest inBAKHTIN thinking has been a major source of renewal in several disciplines suchas in literary studies, linguistics or the humanities in general3. It has, however,never been seriously taken into consideration within the field of IR except forsome authors which used him in a very impressionistic way (see ASHLEY 1989,pp.263 and 281; SHAPIRO 1989, p.81). One has to refer to an article by Iver B.NEUMANN (1996, pp.148-149 and 154-155) to see an outline of the possibleuses of BAKHTIN within IR theory and its potential relevance to the identity-alterity nexus. By focalising on identity and identity formation in internationalrelations, the traditional nexus represented by war and peace (conflict and co-operation), underpinning most IR works so far, would not be alone anymore toserve as an underlying characterisation of the interplay between states or otheragents in the international system. The identity-alterity nexus is in effect acontending, yet not necessarily competing, characterisation at the heart of theepistemological and methodological renewal witnessed during the past decade.This renewal fundamentally concentrated on the questioning of the definition anduse of omnipresent concepts such as anarchy (i.e. the absence of a hierarchyand an order among the main agents of international relations) in the overall3 See for instance the different interdisciplinary books edited in the past five years by AmyMANDELKER (1995), Michael BELL and Michael GARDINER (1998) and Peter HITCHCOCK(1998).© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theoryunderstanding and explanation of international relations. As WENDT (1992)showed, anarchy had been reified by traditional approaches and thus became asubstantive concept which was used to deterministically construct its objects ofstudy. Anarchy became the structural lenses through which the object of study—most generally the state—was constructed. The problem with "positivist"perspectives in IR was then not so much about the idea that social facts, theobject of study and, for some, reality as such were constructed but rather thequestion of "how" it was done and which consequences it has reflectively on IRtheory. This is precisely the kind of questions a dialogical understanding ofinternational relations tries to answer to. However, by using "identity" as adifferent pattern of understanding we should not fall into the same conceptualtrap. Constructivism, as a research programme, has to avoid following the new"logic of identity", as traditional approaches followed the "logic of anarchy", inorder to construct a valid and coherent epistemic body (WEBER 2001, p.78). [14]In using the category "identity" we should therefore be aware of and emphasisethe inherent difficulties and ambiguities related to it, as "identity" is both acategory of political and social practices and a category of political and socialanalysis (see BRUBAKER & COOPER 2000). An "identity" might then be acategory of practice of a cognised subject who might be taken as an "object"through the lenses of "identity" as a category of analysis. We are thus precisely inthe moment where the traditionally defined subjectivity and objectivity arecollapsing together, since what is felt as an "identity" by a subject can beinterpreted only through its objectivation—its constitution as a category ofanalysis. As mentioned, the danger of such a necessary objectivationalmovement lies in its reification, which according to our dialogical framework canbe understood in two complementary ways. First, and in a more classicalunderstanding, if "identity" is not a necessary category of analysis to make senseof phenomenon related to "identity" as a category of practice, it should not beused "...in an implicitly or explicitly reifying manner, in a manner that implies orasserts that ... 'identities' exists and that people 'have' ... an 'identity'". This typeof reification is however common, as exemplified by the neorealist use of"anarchy", and therefore scholars,"[...] should seek to account for this process of reification. We should seek to explainthe processes and mechanisms through which what has been called the 'politicalfiction' of the 'nation' [or 'identity'] can crystallize, at certain moments, as a powerful,compelling reality. But we should avoid unintentionally reproducing or reinforcing suchreification by uncritically adopting categories of practice as categories of analysis"(BRUBAKER & COOPER 2000, pp.5-6; see also MELUCCI 1995, pp.42, 50-51). [15]Second, following a dialogical understanding and in an attempt to addressBRUBAKER and COOPER's stance, reification also means to treat the cognisedas a voiceless "object". It is to say, as we will see, that "identity", as a category ofanalysis, should not become a monological construction of categories ofpractices. The cognised is or has been a subject and "identity" as a fictional(narrative), subjective (individual) and intersubjective (collective) phenomenoncannot therefore be studied as a voiceless "object" since it will characterise it as a© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theorything and not as a reflexive self-representation. A dialogical understanding of"identity", and therefore any objectivational movement adopting such aperspective, partially lift up this problem by approaching an "identity" through theconscious mediation of a hermeneutical locus from which an "identity" is set in adialogical network relative to other "identities" (alterity) defined as relevant bytheir place in this network (determined by their expression, contextuality and rela-tionality in/to this "identity"). Dialogism then is a sound way to propose ananalysis of "identity" without falling into the reification of the concept, as it was thecase with "anarchy". It is furthermore a sound assessment of the epistemicrelation the cognisant has with the cognised. In effect, the process ofobjectivation should not become the effacing of the subjective quality of this"object". The cognisant should enter in a dialogue with the cognised. Thisdialogue, however, shall never be "full" as there will always be a discrepancy inthe communication between the two elements. It precisely is in this dissymmetric,but not necessarily unequal, relation that lies the possibility of knowledge as thecognisant situates him/herself outside the cognised, establishing a dissymmetricdialogue by framing this interrelation through a problématique (in the Frenchacception) (AMORIM 1996, pp.22-23, 31, 59). [16]So let's turn now to the key notion of dialogism to see how it can allow us totackle in a positive and heuristic perspective the problematic relations the notionof "identity" raises in IR theory. In effect, dialogism can constitute a model whichcan epistemologically address the need of an adequate framework in relation tothe nexus between "identity" and "alterity" while integrating in this framework thenotions of subjectivity and reflexivity.4 Dialogism is a concept which mainly has todo with discursive elements and relates more specifically to utterances. BAKHTIN(1986a, p.92, my emphasis) states that:"The expression of an utterance can never be fully understood or explained if itsthematic content is all that is taken into account. The expression of an utterancealways responds to a greater or lesser degree, that is, it expresses the speaker'sattitude toward others' utterances and not just his attitude toward the object of hisutterance. [...] However monological the utterance may be [...], however much it mayconcentrate on its own object, it cannot but be, in some measure, a response to whathas already been said about the given topic, on the given issue, even though thisresponsiveness may not have assumed a clear-cut external expression. [...] Theutterance is filled with dialogic overtones, and they must be taken into account inorder to understand fully the style of the utterance. After all, our thought itself [...] isborn and shaped in the process of interaction and struggle with others' thought, andthis cannot but be reflected in the forms that verbally express our thought as well. [...]The interrelations between inserted others' speech and the rest of the speech (one'sown) [...] are analogous (but, of course, not identical) to relations among rejoinders indialogue". [17]An utterance is thus a moment within a semantic network which is composed bythe sum of all the existing utterances to which the utterance examined is4 The following paragraphs are a synthesis of the dialogical approach I presented in XavierGUILLAUME (2002).© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theorysomehow "responding to". This interweaving of utterances is not necessarily aninterrelation between actual and active utterances, as it can in fact exist betweenactual and active utterances and absent and passive ones (TODOROV 1981,p.97). All in all, an utterance is functionally defined by at least one or manyutterances which belong to a set of utterances either contemporary and/or pre-existing, active and/or passive. There is another essential quality of the utterance:"[I]ts quality of being directed to someone, its addressivity. [...] This addressee can bean immediate participant-interlocutor in an everyday dialogue, [...] a more or lessdifferentiated public, ethnic group, contemporaries, like-minded people, opponentsand enemies. [...] And it can also be an indefinite, unconcretized other [...]. Both thecomposition and, particularly, the style of the utterance depend on those to whom theutterance is addressed, how the speaker (or writer) senses and imagines hisaddressees, and the force of their effect on the utterance" (BAKHTIN 1986a, p.95,emphasis are mine). [18]Addressivity is therefore another central characteristic of any utterance since itprovides an anchorage between dialogism and a theory of "identity". There aretwo mains reasons for such an affirmation. On the one hand, it is necessary tounderstand an utterance as an all-embracing category which is not limited only topurely discursive practices. Any utterance is indeed a conception of the world, aWeltanschauung (TODOROV 1981, p.97). As noted by BAKHTIN in his 1926"Discourse in Life and Discourse in Art" (BAKHTIN 1994, pp.163-164),"the extraverbal situation is far from being merely the external cause of an utterance—it does not operate on the utterance from outside, as if it were a mechanical force.Rather, the situation enters into the utterance as an essential constitutive part of [itssemantic structure]". [19]On the other hand, in an intertextual relation5, the utterance witnesses a subject.In other words, an utterance in order to be part of a dialogical network has notonly to embody a semantic or logical relation to an object but also receive anauthor, its originator by which he/she expresses his/her position. From languagewe thus enter another realm of existence, that of subjectivity, as an utterance canbe the actual expression of the cognised self-understanding/representation. [20]In order to understand international relations in a dialogical manner by focalisingon identity as a factor, it is then necessary to provide an analytical tool enablingthe cognisant to make sense of the cognised without reifying the latter accordingto the problématique of the former. The hermeneutical locus provides such a toolas it is characterised as the interweaving in a specific place (the utterance) of anidentity's expression, its contextuality and its relations to other identities (otherutterances). In review then, dialogism is defined as the interweaving ofutterances that respond to each other. An utterance is characterised as ahermeneutical locus through its expression, its context and its relation to other5 Julia KRISTEVA introduced a distinction between intertextuality, the relation of any utterancewith other utterances, and dialogism in order to differentiate BAKHTIN's literary theory from hisanthropological philosophy (see KRISTEVA 1986a, pp.34-61; 1986b, pp.109-112).© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theoryutterances whether this relation is present and/or past, active and/or passive.Furthermore, an utterance's addressivity links its discursive dimension to itssubjective one by enabling the discerning of its figuration of alterity, hencedialogically of its own self. What is then missing is an understanding of thesignificance of alterity to identity (and vice versa) within a dialogical framework.BAKHTIN (1990, pp.15-16) characterises this relation between a self and another as transgredient. This notion, borrowed from nineteenth century Germanschool of aestheticism, states that an element is named transgredient when itdesignates "elements of our conscience which are exteriors to it but nonethelessessential to the process of its perfection, to its constitution as a totality"(TODOROV 1981, p.146). Transgredience means that a self establishes anecessary relation with a multitude of other selves (alterity); a self alone cannottherefore constitute and be itself within its own realm of existence without theother. According to BAKHTIN's anthropological philosophy, it is thereforeimpossible to become truly self-conscious, to be one self, if one does not revealsone's self to the other, through the other and with the help of the other (BAKHTIN1984, p.287). [21]For BAKHTIN, in order to reach an encompassing view of a self, one has tointegrate through dialogue the vision of a multitude of interactions between theself and selves (alterity) and their position in the world. Dialogism is therefore anepistemologically sound way to establish such semantic network (BAKHTIN 1990,p.36). Even monological utterances enter a dialogical network even if theyparticipate in an unsound ethical and epistemological position since they deny"the existence outside itself of another consciousness with equal rights and equalresponsibilities, another I with equal rights [...]". Furthermore, in a monologicalapproach, taken at its extreme,"[a]nother person remains wholly and merely an object of consciousness, and notanother consciousness. No response is expected from it that could changeeverything in the world of my consciousness. Monologue is finalized and deaf to theother's response, does not expect it and does not acknowledge in it any decisiveforce. Monologue manages without the other, and therefore to some degreematerializes all reality. Monologue pretends to be the ultimate world. It closes downthe represented world and represented persons" (BAKHTIN 1984, pp.292-293). [22]Within a monological figuration then, the other becomes an object of the self'sown conscience which can be interpreted and modified at will in function of theself's own needs as a self-representation. BAKHTIN's dialogism is thusconcerned with both ethics and epistemology. Ethically, the completion andperfection of one's self is determined by the reflexive and dialogical integration ofother selves (contrary to a monological perspective). Epistemologically, dialogismenables us to access soundly the identity-alterity nexus by stressing their inter-relations in an interweaving of mutually-responsive utterances which can beunderstood by the delimitation of a hermeneutical locus. This interweavingrelation constitutes in turn the transgredient relation between a self and otherselves: one cannot be defined without an other. We will see in the next section© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theorythe epistemic consequences this has on an IR theory aiming at tackling theidentity-alterity nexus in regards to the notions of subjectivity and reflexivity. [23]Some IR scholars have already underlined the necessity to address the identity-alterity nexus by stressing the ethical question "how we should treat the Other"(WENDT 1999, pp.21-22, original emphasis) when we have to make sense ofinternational politics, which fundamentally is a politics of the other, a politics ofalterity (GUILLAUME 2002). Otherness should be taken into account in IR theoryto react to the positivistic orientation which dismissed the subjective quality of theother by assuming that it is a functional equivalent to an identity (see WALTZ1979, pp.95-97). Furthermore, traditional approaches assumed the rationality,and thus uniformity, of the multiple identities interacting in the internationalsystem. They even dismissed the subjective quality of the identities at stakerefusing to acknowledge this "field of possibilities" (DOTY 1996, pp.340-341) thatthe notions identity and alterity possess in their political, cultural and sometimesvital implications. This specific "field of possibilities" is beginning to be exploredby IR scholars such as R.B.J. WALKER (1993) or David L. BLANEY and NaeemINAYATULLAH (1994; INAYATULLAH & BLANEY 1996) whose postmodern orcritical approaches essentially focalised on normative and ethical dimensions.These fundamental contributions, however, seem to adopt a "logic of identity"without trying on the first hand to epistemologically integrate the identity-alteritynexus to IR, and by extension the notions of subjectivity and reflexivity. [24]This section tried to underline dialogism as an epistemological alternative to thetraditional positivist perspective underpinning most IR scholarship since the1950s. While positivism might have a certain relevance for number of topicsrelated to international relations, it remains that positivism is only but oneepistemic stance among others. Dialogism represents one of these possiblestances, in particular in relation to the identity-alterity nexus problématique whichpositivism tends to avoid as the idea of the subjectivity of the cognised isdismissed through the veil of objectivity. In effect, we have seen that a way totackle the identity-alterity nexus according to dialogism is to define identity as anutterance in the sense and with the consequences I have underlined according toa dialogical perspective. This perspective furthermore defines identity, asubjectivity, in its transgredient relation to otherness, that is alternative subjectiveself-understandings/representations. Dialogism is thus a way to address the firstlevel of the scientific inquiry, the level of the cognised's subjective relations, prob-lematised in this framework as identities, by recognising the "object of study" as asubiectum and not as a voiceless thing. The hermeneutical locus, understooddialogically as the interwoven relations in an utterance of the identity-alteritynexus, thus becomes the actual "dynamic epistemic structure according to whichthe 'act' or 'phenomenal' event means and functions" (DOP 2000, p.18). Thecognised subjectivity is then accessible to the cognisant through an assessmentof its expressivity, its contextuality and its relationality vis-à-vis other subjectiveself-understandings/ representations. This structure is constructed through theproblématique set up by the cognisant according to the epistemic limitations thehermeneutical locus imposes on him. The next section will accordingly present arelational assessment of the two levels of the scientific inquiry left. [25]© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theory3. The Hermeneutical Locus as a Reflexive Tool for and onInternational Relations TheoryTo consider the cognised as a subject is, of course, an ontological position in thesame sense that those who consider the cognised as an object participate toanother ontological position. To recognise this most forgotten evidence does notonly participate to a reflexive consideration about any form of approaches, suchas dialogism, but also requires us to undertake an epistemological discussion ofthis approach according to this stance. In effect, any approach should to aminimum extent integrate a reflection on the epistemic consequences one's ownontological choices bear. Such assessments should, in turn, take intoconsideration the two levels of scientific inquiry remaining to further discuss: i) therelation between the cognisant and the cognised and, ii) the relations betweenthe cognisants. The hermeneutical locus, a dialogical mechanism I introduced inthe previous section, provides us with a tool by which both levels can beconsidered in examining and taking into account the expressivity, thecontextuality and the relationality of each levels. Moreover, each level is moreparticularly concerned with a specific problem or concern, whether that ofreification the cognisant might impose on the cognised or of the meaning of theintersubjective quality of the relations existing between the cognisants. In otherwords, the hermeneutical locus should represent a reflexive tool for and on IRtheory. [26]As mentioned, one of the main problems which faces any approach wishing torecognise the subjective quality of the cognised is that of reification. Dialogism,via the hermeneutical locus, tries to bypass this problem by focusing on adialogical account of the cognised. In effect, according to this perspective, theobject of study is not the cognised itself but the process of their interrelations andinteractions. As Pierre BOURDIEU noted once, "il faut penser relationnellement"[one has to think relationally] (1992a, p.200). The cognisant is actually fostering asubjective and reflexive relation to the cognised according to a problématiquedelineating the cognised's "objectivation" in its interrelations with other subjects.BAKHTIN (1986c, p.161) sustains that a subject cannot, epistemologically, bestudied as thing for to do so would make it voiceless while being subiectum."Cognition of it [therefore] can only be dialogic". This signifies that the process ofobjectivation, the structuring of a subject into a problématique, is possible as longas this objectivation does not transform a subiectum into a voiceless object. Theobjectivation should not become an instrumentalisation of the subject to the pro-blématique and the subsequent theoretical framework as was the case with mostpositivist scholarship. An interesting and simple example, illustrated by a recentarticle from Richard LEBOW (2001), is the classical interpretation and use ofTHUCYDIDES' History of the Peloponnesian War as a one of the main realistforebear in their different claims about the structure of the war-peace nexus(WALTZ 1979, p.127). THUCYDIDES has always been seen as one of the firstsetting the underpinning elements of IR realism such as: (a) the centrality of thestates (city-states) as the dominant and functionally equivalent units of action; (b)the depiction of the states as power-seeking entities whether as a means or as anend and (c) the ascription to the states of a rational behaviour assessable in© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theoryrational terms (KEOHANE 1986, p.7). Furthermore, THUCYDIDES' account ofwar and his "causal" approach to facts made him an enlightened observer on themechanisms at work in an anarchic system—a system in which nothing higherthan the units can either delimit or reduce the units in their power-seeking drive—, thus reflecting the "state of nature", a zero-sum game like environment, inwhich these units act. THUCYDIDES is thus deemed to have set up and to reflectthe natural and unchanging rules that drove, drive and will drive the states in theirrelations and then is basically reflecting the fundamental hard core of the realistresearch programme (see LAKATOS 1970, p.48). [27]These use and appropriation are, however, and to follow LEBOW (2001, p.559),a "superficial and one-sided portrayal" of THUCYDIDES' book which is typical ofa certain perspective of IR theory as a nomothetic approach to the social world(see LEVY 2001, p.41). In effect, realists tend to superimpose their programme'shard core to the articulation of, in this case, THUCYDIDES' Peloponnesian Warwhile ignoring the incompleteness and errors such a superimposition bears(BAGBY 1994, LEBOW 2001). These critics follows the line of the traditionaldistinction between nomothetic (e.g. IR theory) and idiographic (e.g. history)disciplines and the need for the former to adopt some of the latter's naturalimpetus to regard evidences, whether pro or contra one's theory, and context ascompelling elements since the former tend to "allow their theories to take priorityover the evidence, focus on those historical events that confirm their theories,and ignore the larger context in which events occur and in the absence of whichthose events cannot be fully understood" (LEVY 2001, pp.49-50). The nomotheticdrive to construct and test theories is the underlying reason why THUCYDIDESwas perceived by the realists as a forebear since they picked in his work whatseemed to fulfil their expectations, as in the Melian Dialogue, and to provide atest for their ahistorical theory on how international relations were framed andworked. LEBOW strikingly demonstrates a contrario that if a "realist"THUCYDIDES is indeed present, he is far from being the only, or even the mostimportant, THUCYDIDES speaking in the Peloponnesian War: There is also aconstructivist THUCYDIDES voicing in the text. In effect, a close reading ofTHUCYDIDES' History shows that his underlying inquiry is that of the relationshipbetween nomos (convention) and phusis (nature), and its implications for theconstitution of the Greek culture and civilisation, and that his conclusionemphasises the role of nomos in the construction of identities and in thedelineation and limitation of the behaviour of both individuals and societies(LEBOW 2001). As this example illustrated, the main problem with non-reflexivenomothetic perspectives is that they consider the way of doing science in whatMichel MEYER (1986, p.20) coins an apocritical direction, that is a direction whichisolate a certain number of problems (e.g. why states go to war?) and byanswering these problems seeks to solve and suppress them as such. In afashion that is parallel to natural sciences, the aim of "positivist" social sciences isto offer, as Meyer underlined, "an apocritical answer [which] closes the inquiry,stems back and breaks away from the problems at stake" as it provides ananswer which is supposed to solve and suppress the question altogether. [28]© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations TheorySocial sciences, however, by answering to a problématique do not actually solve,and thus suppress, the "problem" at the origin the latter. Natural sciences dealwith objective questionings that require definite answers in order to suppressthem. Of course, once solved these questionings create new ones but they aredefinitively "behind" in the realm of science. In other words, we do not askourselves the question to know why an apple falls from a tree anymore yet we stillwonder why states go to war. This recurrent questioning still manage to createwide debates in IR, as in the Democratic Peace debate, despite nearly threethousands years of more or less cunning tries from THUCYDIDES' hubris toHUNTINGTON's civilisational explanation. Maybe the right answer has yet to befound, and many liberals see in the Democratic Peace argument such a definiteanswer (see RUSSETT 1993), yet none of the answers so far given broughtabout the suppression of the question "why states go to war?" or the peace-warnexus problématique as such. Anyhow, if Democratic Peace proponents wouldprove that in order to solve and suppress this question altogether it wasnecessary to establish global democracy in the world, it remains nonetheless thatthe peace-war nexus would still remain as a problématique, whether or not it istransformed in a softer or more focused articulation between co-operation andconflict. States, or other agents of international relations, will always interact,perform or behave in a way that will require IR scholars to consider which nexusmight be the most relevant to explain or understand some phenomena. [29]The focus of IR theory should then shift from this traditional apocritical direction,which blindfolds many IR scholars from epistemic and, often, methodologicalproblems, to a more reflexive direction as underlined by ALVESSON andSKÖLDBERG's definition (2000, p.5). As their definition suggests, there are twomoments in which reflexivity can take part in IR theory. The first movement isrelated to the second level of the scientific inquiry while the second movement isrelated to the third level. On the one hand, reflexivity is thus present in therelations the cognisant has with the cognised, that is how the former reflexivelyconstructs the latter and the process of its interactions and interrelations withother subjects. Dialogism offers such a frame, as presented in the previoussection, by delineating the cognisant scope of inquiry according to a reflexive tool,the hermeneutical locus, which specifically deals with processuality, through itsfocus on relationality, and aims at bridging IR theory nomothetic tradition to amore idiographic conception for dialogism possesses a particular interest incontextuality and expressivity. The three elements of the hermeneutical locusentail that a special attention should be paid to the actual reflexive way by whichthe cognisant chooses the "identities" at stake in its construction of aproblématique. An elegant way to further avoid reification and instrumentalizationis thus to employ conscious counterfactual thought experiments which, in thewords of Philip TETLOCK and Aaron BELKIN (1996, p.15), provides, by"asking people to think how things could have worked out differently[,] a means ofpreventing the world that did occur from blocking our views of the worlds that mightwell have occurred if some antecedent condition had taken on a different value". [30]© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations TheoryThis specification is only one among several, and not the most important to theireyes, that counterfactuals could take according to TETLOCK and BELKIN. Bothauthors actually favour counterfactuals within a highly positivist perspective onhow to deal with social sciences, rejecting altogether the implications ofcounterfactuals within more interpretative perspectives (whether constructivist orpostmodern for instance) in world politics. Hence, TETLOCK and BELKINimplicitly put aside those latter perspectives as unscientific as they are and notbeing able to predict events and only able to offer subjective, circular andnonfalsifiable standpoints (TETLOCK & BELKIN 1996, pp.27, 30-31, 37-38). Thisview, as stressed by Steven WEBER (1996) and Richard LEBOW (2000, p.578),is extremely reductive on the possible use of such an interesting tool and oneshould, on the contrary, expand its scope by focusing more on its use as a way"to accrue evidence and arguments to convince people that some hypotheses areprobably weak and others probably stronger" (WEBER 1996, p.272).Furthermore, and as specified by LEBOW (2000, p.551, my emphasis), "themethods of counterfactual experimentation need to be commensurate with thepurposes for which they are used [...]". A dialogical understanding of internationalrelations specifically undertakes such experimentation by concentrating oncontextuality and expressivity in order to determine which utterances, whichcompeting or alternative self-understanding/ representation(s) are to beconsidered as dominant in the dialogical constitution and performance of anintersubjective representation defined as national. There are naturally manydialogical interactions constituting a self-understanding/representation, the pointbeing to evaluate which dialogue is dominant for a specific self-understanding/representation within a situated intersubjectivity. The dominant dia-logue should henceforth arise as a heuristic momentum only if it is put inperspective with counterfactual dominant and non-dominant dialogues, that isalternative dialogues which allow the cognisant to a situated and processualreference outside the self-understanding/representation constructed as a subject ofstudy. This necessity to evaluate alternative, counterfactual elements arise fromthe risk that the dialogue constructed by the cognisant has been so to explain orunderstand events ex post facto, that is it has been chosen in order to explain orunderstand a certain outcome, or even to fulfil the expectancies of theproblématique or the theoretical model chosen by the cognisant (this point alwayshad been a major criticism to nomothetic disciplines from more idiographic ones).Such a construction would not be epistemologically sound since it would thenmake inferences in the perspective of the outcome. [31]Counterfactuals constitute therefore a way to reflexively and soundly construct aproblématique and its related theoretical developments. Furthermore,counterfactual thought experiments are vital ingredients in the evaluation andtesting of the heuristic of the dominant dialogue proposed by the cognisant (seeLEBOW 2000, pp.558-564). This counterfactual logic globally follows a doublerationale which firstly establishes a dominant dialogue as a "logical imperative",appealing to a more nomothetic dimension, within a certain context by imaginingwhat other dialogues would plausibly be and which relevance they would have ina specified situated intersubjectivity and relationality. This logical exercise isaimed at establishing the sine qua non dialogue in a certain contextuality framed© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theoryby the problématique. Consequently, however, this dominant dialogue also has tobe a "historical imperative", the second component of the counterfactual rationaleand which would result in a more idiographic dimension in IR theory, if one wantsto reach a sound understanding. This historical imperative seeks to consider thealternatives which were actually offered by the cognised according to contempo-rary evidence (see FERGUSON 1997, p.79-90).6 The dominant dialogue chosenshould therefore be the result of a double rationale—logical and historical—whichthrough an evaluation of the possible alternatives and of the robustness ofhistorical evidences should both alleviate the reification of the "identities"contemplated, rule out a deterministic study of their dialogue and evaluate thehistorical pertinence of the dialogue chosen by situating them simultaneouslywithin a probabilistic frame and a historical relevance. [32]Reflexivity, on the other hand, is also present in the relations the cognisantentertains with other cognisant. Reflexivity, following BOURDIEU's "epistemicreflexivity" (BOURDIEU & WACQUANT 1992), means that the cognisant has toconsider that him/herself as a "cultural producer" and thus to reflect on the "socio-historical conditions of possibility" of this specific discourse that is science. Thepoint is to subject the cognisant to the same critical inquiry he/she was compelledto apply to the cognised. In BOURDIEU's terminology, any discipline of socialsciences has to undertake a work of "objectivation of the subject who objectivize"in which open debates and mutual criticism, dialogical debates BAKHTIN wouldsay, are undertaken in order to institutionalise reflexivity. IR, however, possessedand still possess to a large extent, according to LAPID (1989, pp.249-250), "thedubious honor of being among the least self-reflexive of the Western socialsciences". Some IR scholars have nonetheless tried to tackle the notion ofreflexivity and to provide an account of it within the discipline. So far, the mostthorough treatment of the notion of reflexivity in IR, to my knowledge, is to befound in Mark NEUFELD's The Restructuring of International Relations Theory(1995). NEUFELD (pp.13-21), drawing from KANT, HEGEL and MARX, situates"theoretical reflexivity", in the overall category of critical thinking, as one of themain characteristics of emancipatory theory. This specific positioning stands insharp opposition to positivist IR theory, and provides a special "attention to thecreative role of human consciousness, and an engagement in social criticism insupport of practical political activity orientated toward radical social change",theoretical reflexivity therefore being the "theoretical reflection on the process oftheorizing itself". This general definition embeds three core elements which are"(i) self-consciousness about underlying premises; (ii) the recognition of theinherently politico-normative dimension of paradigms and the normal sciencetradition they sustain; and (iii) the affirmation that reasoned judgements about themerits of contending paradigms are possible in the absence of a neutralobservation of language". NEUFELD acknowledges that (i) is admittedlyrecognised by both positivist and post-positivist stances but stresses that (ii) and6 Richard LEBOW (2000, pp.567-574) proposes a very strong criticism of FERGUSON's overalluse of counterfactuals. These criticisms are justified especially as FERGUSON's historicalrestrictions would "exclude entire categories of plausible-world counterfactuals" (p.569). Theperspective that I propose hereby is nonetheless still consistent with LEBOW's criteria(pp.581-585) as I try to adapt counterfactuals to a use specific to more interpretativeperspectives in IR theory and with a precise epistemological articulation.© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theory(iii) are actually what makes "reflexivity a virtual antonym of positivism"(pp.40-41). Both elements, in effect, oppose the positivist standpoint about "truthas correspondence" and science as a "process without a subject". If anyonecommitted to a post-positivist perspective can readily agree on the secondelement, one has to be careful on the first. NEUFELD's normative andemancipatory stances, on the one hand, recognise the intersubjective nature ofscience (p.42), yet, on the other hand, reassess the necessity of a truth valuewhich would not be situated anymore in an empirical reality, however constructedby the cognisant, but through each theories' politico-normative assumptions. In aparadoxical way, NEUFELD, and many other normativists, actually abide to aform of "positivism" as they remain attached to a fundamental criteria linked tothe basic principle of "truth as correspondence", "truth" in this case being thenormative requirement of emancipation. Consider the following (p.44):"[...] reflexive theorists accept incommensurability as the necessary consequence ofthe fact that paradigm-specific knowledge-defining standards are themselvesintimately connected to and embedded in competing social and political agendas, thepolitical-normative contents of which are not amenable to any neutral observationlanguage". [33]In other words, since "empirie" does not fit to be a relevant referent as there is noneutral observation language, contending perspectives cannot be confrontedaccording to this form of referent. Yet, "reflexive theorists do not accept thatrecognizing contending paradigms as incommensurable means reasonedassessments are impossible". Furthermore (p.46), "judgements about contendingparadigms are possible by means of reasoned assessments of the politico-normative content of the projects they serve, of the ways of life to which theycorrespond". Thus, judgement is possible with an admittedly unneutralobservation language which will reasonably evaluate the different "paradigms"according to a normative referent, that of the emancipatory potential of these"paradigms". If I supported the idea that this type of normativism can be equatedto "positivism", it was to underline that both perspectives were attached to theidea of truth, whether "empirical" or "normative", in an epistemic assessment ofthe value of a theory. The notion of truth, however, has long been discarded bymost contemporary epistemologists (see AGAZZI 1988) as an aporia alleviatedby the simple knowledge that all scientific (or normative) inquiry participate in anopen intersubjective discourse. The point of reflexivity in IR theory precisely is torecognise the intersubjective process any "paradigm" went through in order toestablish "operative criteria" on the use of certain number of notions (e.g. anarchyor identity) in order to set a scientific (or normative) agenda according to anagreement on these criteria (see AGAZZI 1988, p.19). The danger of NEUFELD'sperspective is to reduce IR theory to a mere backup of theories deemed"emancipatory", the new criterion of truth, which will be defined through "abroader debate about which 'purposes', which 'enquiries' and which 'ideologies'merit the support and energy of International Relations scholars" (NEUFELD1995, p.68, my emphasis). NEUFELD proposes a crude and simplistic oppositionbetween "science" and "politico-normative" which does not take into account thepossibility to render and recognise the second while continuing working in the© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theoryframework of the first. If one can understand NEUFELD's will to replace the ideaof episteme, a timeless and unchanging perspective, by that of phronesis,integrating variability and contingency (p.45), one cannot fail to situate NEUFELDin close range to doxa, the realm of opinion, as the validity criterion chosen byhim is highly subjective, not even intersubjective. To the credit of NEUFELD, onehas nonetheless to recognise with him that IR theory, as underlined WEBER(2001, pp.129-134), is a site of cultural practice."It is a site where stories that make sense of our world are spun, where signifyingpractices about international politics take place, where meanings about internationallife are produced, reproduced, and exchanged. [...] More importantly, IR theory is asite of cultural practice because it provides a framework for storytelling itself"(pp.129-130, original emphasis). [34]As it is rightly pointed by many critical theorists, whether or not followingNEUFELD's predicaments, IR theory had the tendency to consider its ownframework of analysis, alongside many different concepts such as anarchy oridentity, as natural, neutral and unbiased as they were considered to participate inthe scientific inquiry in the tradition of "real science". Mainstream IR theory furtherparticipated in a standardisation of the discipline by expelling alternativeexplanations, usually based on non-positivist or non-quantitativist positions, inlight of their "constructivist", "unneutral" or "biased" grounding. They placedalternative perspectives outside the realm of IR theory, i.e. the realm of science,and rejected them altogether as most of these perspectives tried to provide amore reflexive turn and function, in the sense given by ALVESSON andSKÖLDBERG, to the discipline (see WEBER 2001, p.131). These parochialviews on IR theory were due, in my opinion and as we foresaw in the previoussection, to a misplaced focus on what was to be understood as "science","empirical" or "unbiased", as natural sciences were the actual referent to socialsciences. In light of the discussion so far, it seems necessary to create newfoundations for social sciences, foundations which acknowledge the peculiarnature of the cognised and the specific place of the cognisant in their overallinteractions in a system of knowledge aside from the realm of opinion andpolitical partisanship. [35]Dialogism, by the intermediary of the hermeneutical locus, provides a reflexiveaccount of IR theory as a site of cultural practice. The hermeneutical locus can ineffect be used on utterances (e.g. realism, liberalism, constructivism,postmodernism, etc.) which will be examined as specific utterances according totheir place in the academic discussion concerning international relations, thusoffering an analysis of IR which takes as a starting point the idea that eachcurrent within our discipline, as any fields of social sciences, or any specificdiscursive assessment (a book, an article, a presentation, etc.), can beconsidered through a reflexive investigation. The aim of this investigation is to linkboth the critical tradition, represented here by NEUFELD, and a more traditional"disciplinary history" (see HOLDEN 2002). It is, in a way, to ask for anarchaeology of IR theory in all its dimensions. As HOLDEN (2002, p.255)rightfully noted, there should not be any "privileged vantage-point from which IR's© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theorydisciplinary history can be written. This means that 'critical IR' itself needs to beanalysed and contextualized". Critical IR, like any other currents of IR theory, hasto submit itself to the same scrutiny it used to submit the others. This scrutiny, asI just mentioned, can take the form of an archaeology, a term inspired by MichelFOUCAULT (1969) who gave it to his inquiry of discourses some 30 years ago. [36]An archaeology (FOUCAULT 1969, pp.182-183) is fundamentally not a way tofind a hidden discourse behind the utterance under examination, in a structuralistsense, but a way to define utterances as such, as "practices obeying to rules". Anarchaeology of IR aims to define an utterance within IR discourse in its specificityvis-à-vis other utterances and in their unity within "the types and rules of discurs-ive practices that go beyond the individuals works". An archaeology is, finally, anexteriority which does not aim at describing the origin of an utterance but at sys-tematically depicting the latter as an "object" of inquiry. We clearly see here thatwe are at the juncture of both critical tradition and a more traditional intellectual-historical perspective. In effect, by paying attention to practices, FOUCAULTwanted to pay attention to "a preconceptual, anonymous, socially sanctioned bodyof rules that govern one's manner of perceiving, judging, imagining, and acting"(FLYNN 1994, p.30). This is to be linked to the critical tradition. FOUCAULT'sobjective (1969, pp.170-173), however, was also to pay attention to the archive,that is "a practice which raise a multiplicity of utterances as many regular events".The archive is fundamentally "the general system of the formation andtransformation of the utterances". An archaeology is then the description of "theutterances as specified practices in their modality of archive". This is to be linkedto the intellectual-historical tradition. As FLYNN noted (1994, p.30),"an archive is the locus of the rules and prior practices forming the conditions ofinclusion or exclusion that enable certain practices and prevent others from beingaccepted as 'scientific,' or 'moral,' or whatever other social rubric may be in use at aparticular epoch. [...] Reference to 'epoch' is crucial, for these archives are time-bound and factual; they are discovered, not deduced; they are the locus of practicesas 'positivities' to be encountered, not as 'documents' to be interpreted. [...] The claimthat these practices are to be registered as facts, not read as the result of intentionsof some sort, gives [...] [Foucault's] archaeology its 'positivist' tilt [...]". [37]By considering a precise current of IR theory, from realism to critical theories, asa hermeneutical locus, dialogism can reflexively bring about a refined analysis ofIR theory in the overall sense inspired by FOUCAULT's archaeology. Contextuallyspeaking, an utterance, such as that of realism in IR theory, has to be consideredas a practice, in the sense given above, taking into account its predicates,assertions and norms as to retrace both the "internal discursive" and the externalimpetus behind the origin and evolution of this specific utterance within thediscourse of IR. Expressively, the many assertions constituting realism—e.g. thebooks, articles, conferences, interviews of their proponents—are as manyelements delineating an archive and thus subject to both "internal" and "external"inquiry. This type of work is to a certain extent already at the heart of the presentfocus of "the contextualizers", to borrow HOLDEN's terminology (2002). What ismissing, however, is this relational dimension under which should also be© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theoryanalysed the contribution of these utterances in an intersubjective discussionwhich has been one of the focus of this paper: IR theory discourse. Who is"realism" or any "critical theory" answering to? To which extent their utterancesreflect monological or dialogical approaches to the cognised or to othercognisant? How are contextually and expressively constructed the approaches'archives within IR theory and, more generally, within social sciences? Are theseapproaches even taking part in the epistemic reflexivity any discipline has to gothrough? As these last questions imply, the cognisant should consciously anddialogically participate in IR discourse comprehended as a semantic network. Thenotion of reflexivity, as presented here, is a way to go beyond the antinomicperspectives of postmodernism, in which is embedded the idea of deconstruction,and modernism, in which is embedded the idea of positivist social sciences.Reflexivity should link the possibility and the necessity of the scientific knowledgewith the idea that any knowledge should be deconstructed as a contingent notiongrounded in political, social, economic and historical dimensions. As accuratelynoted by WACQUANT (BOURDIEU & WACQUANT 1992, p.38), "to confuse thepolitics of science (knowledge) with that of society (power), is [in the end] to rejectthe historically instituted autonomy of the scientific field". [38]The aim of this section was to underscore the necessity for social sciences, andby extension IR theory, to recognise the subjective quality of its "object of study".As mentioned alongside BAKHTIN (1981, p.351), social sciences possess "thespecific task of establishing, transmitting and interpreting the words of others".The process of objectification should then not be equated to a process ofreification in which the cognised becomes a voiceless thing instrumentalised by aresearch programme. The cognised, as a subjective self-understanding/repre-sentation, has to be integrated within IR theory in an epistemological framework,such as dialogism, which structurally tries to avoid the process of reification andthus avoid entering in either the "logic of anarchy" or that of "identity". The use ofa counterfactual logic has thus been presented as a complementary way to avoidreification of the cognised within a certain problématique and to reflexively justifythe choice of the setting in an hermeneutical locus. Furthermore, dialogism hasbeen presented in opposition to an apocritical perspective and linked to a fullyreflexive and ongoing appraisal of (i) the cognisant relations to the cognised,through the problématique and the objectivation; (ii) the cognisant relations toother cognisant within the intersubjective realm of science. In order to achievethis goal, it has been underlined that IR theory has to face the task of recognisingitself as a site of cultural practice and thus acknowledge the need of anarchaeology of the discipline and its different currents. A dialogical perspectivethus wishes to provide a way to account a real dialogue for and on IR theory. [39]© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theory4. ConclusionThe BAKHTINian definition of dialogism—as an interweaving of utterancescharacterised by their contextuality, expressivity and relationality—thus unveils anonto-epistemic dimension designating a process by which any cognised isaccessible to any cognisant as long as it is replaced within its subjective semanticnetwork and its relationality to other cognised. Accordingly dialogism is not only areflexive way by which we can construct knowledge about the social world westudy as cognisant but also a way by which we can analyse and evaluate thesocial world we construct as producers of knowledge. This is to followBOURDIEU in his opinion that the models used by the cognisant to make senseof the cognised should also be reflexively applied onto the cognisant him/herself(BOURDIEU & WACQUANT 1992). The hermeneutical locus has been presentedas a reflexive tool for IR theory as a way to avoid reification and monologismwhen the cognisant is constituting his problématique and thus is dealing with thecognised. Furthermore, the hermeneutical locus has been equally portrayed as areflexive tool on IR theory in order to provide the discipline with an archaeologyaiming at reconstituting the dialogical relations different IR currents entertain onewith another and to qualify and situate each archive with the IR theory discourse.These basic conclusions concerning a dialogical approach do not limitthemselves to the sole field of IR theory. All fields of social sciences might benefitfrom a more reflexive approach whether to their "subject"/ "object" of study or totheir own discipline itself. A greater epistemological self-consciousness and self-assertiveness within any type of problématique or research design might prove tobe a heuristic drive to improve and better delineate the definition of some arch-concept such as power or identity, as such concepts should reflexively beconnected to the problématique at work. [40]It is important to note that a dialogical perspective does not seek to provide theonly framework by which subjectivity and reflexivity would be better integrated inIR theory. NEUFELD's attempt (1995) is only but one other framework accordingto which subjectivity and reflexivity can be addressed within IR. NEUFELD,however, is an epitome of the danger of such an integration if one wants tosituate reflexivity and subjectivity at the heart of scientific inquiry. To situate suchnotions within scientific inquiry is admittedly a normative assumption as to knowwhat is the core of the social sciences composed of. Furthermore, within IRtheory, it is to normatively reject monological account of the cognised. But theoverall aim of a scientific inquiry, contrary to NEUFELD's politico-normativeperspective, is to constitute a body of knowledge within an open andintersubjective discussion (AGAZZI 1988) and not to promote any ideologicalagenda. To integrate the idea of subjectivity and reflexivity precisely is toconstitute a body of knowledge that is self-aware, through its own archaeology, ofits bias and limitations. Positivist perspectives, as well as constructivist or criticalperspectives, within IR have to take account for the specific characterisation oftheir "object of study" and to focalise on the process of their interactions andinterrelations. A dialogical approach, as I showed, offers such an overallperspective and is specifically designed to tackle the specific nexus betweenidentity and alterity. The latter nexus possesses probably far more reaching© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(3), Art. 13, Xavier Guillaume:Reflexivity and Subjectivity: A Dialogical Perspective for and on International Relations Theorypotentialities for IR theory than the classical war-peace nexus as it creates morecommon grounds on which cross-field discussions or examinations can takeplace. For instance, one can think about linking normative theories aboutcitizenship and politics of recognition (see GIANNI 1998) with IR theoreticalperspectives on the interrelations between domestic and international issuesfocalising on the notion of "national identity" (see KRATOCHWIL 1996). Adialogical approach would thus be a common denominator to reflexively compareand combine both fields. Moreover, this essay wished to establish that adialogical understanding was a potentially feasible approach to cognise worldpolitics and that to address the question of epistemology was neither a merespeciality nor personal choice but a real heuristic plus for any searchers wishingto clarify and to expand their knowledge on their own practice.
