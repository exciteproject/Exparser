IntroductionLate 20th century can be described as a flourishing period of the democratic societies’ development. BeforeWorld War II, only 28% of countries worldwide claimed to be democratic. By the end of 20th century,particularly after the fall of the Berlin wall, this figure increased to 62%. Whether the process of thedemocratization of the societies will continue, depends mostly on the citizens’ willingness to be activelyinvolved in political and civic activities, such as: defining issues, policy making, solving public problems,taking responsibility for building communities, and participating in the political and electoral processes.According to William Damon (2001), the process of the democratization worldwide is not moving inthe right direction in particular because of the civic and political disengagement of the young people.Indifference is the greatest in mature democracies, but is apparent in many new democracies orproblematic one. Today, as he claims, the general young people’s attitude towards democracy is apathy orcynicism.On the other hand, higher education is recognized as key to delivering the knowledge requirementsfor political development. It is essential for the design and operation of key political institutions of a modernpolitical system, from the judiciary to the legislative and executive arms of government, the top staffing ofthe state bureaucracy as well as key institutions of civil society. Moreover, public higher education indemocracies is typically mandated to contribute to the development of an enlightened, critically constructivecitizenry (Luescher-Mamashela, 2011: 9).Hence, many researchers, with significant funding from foundations, have focused on the collegestudent demographic to assess the civic and political health of the nation’s new generations. Results showa generation that is both disconnected from conventional politics, and yet has much civic potential. There iswidespread evidence, along with a general characterization in the media, that college students today arecynical and apathetic about politics. Survey research has also demonstrated that young people areconsiderably less knowledgeable of and interested in political affairs (Longo and Meyer, 2006: 5).Having in mind that the Republic of Macedonia is considered to be a young democracy, thediscussion pertaining to the relevance and significance of democracy is one of the most contested issues inthe political and academic debates in the Republic of Macedonia. The issue of democracy, as well as theissue of the citizens’ engagement in political and civic activities, is of a great importance particularly havingin mind the fact that a stable democratic regime does not only require well-designed and functioningpolitical institutions and processes to be sustainable and consolidated; it requires democrats (Mattes et al.1999).The paper gives an insight into attitudes towards democracy of young people in Republic ofMacedonia, in particular their interest in politics and their engagement in civic and political activities. Thefindings in the paper rely on the data from following research projects: Virtual and Real Identities in theRepublic of Macedonia1, Youth Trends in the Republic of Macedonia2 и Youth Study Macedonia 20133.1 The project was conducted by the Institute for Sociological, Political and Juridical Research – Skopje, Republic of Macedonia.The project was based on the research of political attitudes and identities of the student population in Macedonia, by directsurveying of respondents. The survey was conducted from September 2012 until July 2013. The number of respondents in thesurvey is representative for the Republic of Macedonia in terms of ethnicity, gender, religion, place of residence and region. Itcovered a group of 707 respondents. General characteristics of the sample were the following: 707 students from 4 stateuniversities and 2 private universities; 256 male and 451 female students; Macedonians 442, Albanians 239 and others 26; 201were living in rural and 504 in urban areas. All the respondents were third and fourth year students. The survey was undertakenamong the students on the universities in Skopje, Bitola, Shtip and Tetovo.Open Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 57Ganka Cvetanova and Bojana Naumovska: “Democratic Valuues and Political Attitudes of the Macedonian Young People”EQPAM Volume 5 No.2 April 2016ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916The paper includes questions that explore the attitudes of young people towards democracy, inparticular their interest in politics, their civic and political engagement: Are young people interested in politics; Where do they get information about politics and do they use news media; How often they discuss about politics with their friends; Their engagement in civic activities and civic associations; Their engagement in political activities i.e. electoral participation;Throughout this paper, the pursuit of these questions is interlaced with a comparativeanalytical perspective involving the following dimensions: Comparison of the attitudes of young people towards democracy by their ethnic belonging; Comparison of the attitudes towards democracy by their gender;Having in mind that this review focuses on attitudes of young people towards democracy, thenotions of democracy, is to be further defined and elaborated on.2. Understanding Democracy‘Democracy’ is one of the most used and arguable concepts in more recent history, particularly after the fallof the Berlin Wall. Definitions and operationalization of this concept vary quite a bit. Hence, even thoughthere is no universally accepted definition, there are two approaches in defining democracy: ‘minimal’ and‘maximal’. The first one focuses on the importance of ‘means’, that is, procedures such as fair elections,respect for human rights, and universal suffrage. In contrast, maximal definitions include not onlydemocratic procedures but also ‘ends’, or outputs (such as economic equality and social services)(Baviskar and Malone, 2004: 4).Democracy in political theory is described as a political philosophy, but also as a form of governingwhere the governing power lies in the hands of people, and it may be exercised either in an immediate(direct democracy) or intermediate manner (indirect democracy), i.e. according to the principle ofpresentation and representation of interests realized by virtue of free and fair elections. Modern orcontemporary interpretation of democracy is connected with the philosophical principle of equal rights.Hence, the notion of democracy is occasionally used in the context of liberal democracy, which on the otherhand implies existence of certain additional elements, such as political pluralism, equality before the law,civil freedoms and civil rights, i.e. all the agents in a civil society. Furthermore, these elements represent aparameter regarding the level of democracy within societies (Atanasov and Cvetanova, 2013: 27).2 The survey research was conducted by the Institute for Sociological, Political and Juridical Research – Skopje and Agency forYouth and Sport in the period between October and December 2014. This survey research (vis-à-vis) was conducted covering arepresentative sample of the young population (aged 15 to 29). The final number of respondents in the survey research was1190.3 The survey research was conducted by the Institute for Sociological, Political and Juridical Research – Skopje and FriedrichEbert Stifung in the period between September and November 2013. A combined approach employing both quantity and qualitytechniques and procedures was implemented in the course of the survey research. This survey research (vis-à-vis) wasconducted covering a representative sample of the young population, as well as semi-structured in-depth interviews with bothtypical and atypical representatives of the young population. The final number of respondents was 1026, whereas the surveyedpopulation was aged 15 to 29.Open Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 58European Quarterly of Political Attitudes and Mentalities EQPAMVolume 5, No.2, April 2016ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916Different scholars define democracy in different ways. Definitions of democracy often areinfluenced by the aspect they emphasize. For example: some of the definitions focus on the institutions andprocedures of democratic governance, others on political aspect i.e. freedom and liberties, and third takeinto account the social dimension i.e. social benefits.These three broad alternatives—institutions and procedures, freedom and liberties, and socialbenefits—constitute the primary substantive choices in defining democracy. Certainly people will offer otherresponses if asked to define democracy spontaneously. Yet the extent to which democracy is defined interms of these three broad choices provides a framework to assess the high levels of public support fordemocracy in recent public-opinion surveys and the implications of these democratic aspirations. Eachalternative has different implications for the interpretation of public opinion toward democracy and theprinciples that guide the democratization process (Dalton, Shin, and Jou, 2007: 145).Despite many definitions and different approaches in defining democracy, political theory highlightsthree pillars that underpin democracy: transparency, accountability and right to participate. Therefore,citizen participation – as one of the three pillars - is regarded widely as vital to democracy. The classicKantian distinction between active and passive citizens implies that only those citizens who in one way oranother actively participate in decision-making are indeed different from the subjects of a nondemocraticpolity (Weinrib, 2008).3. Republic of MacedoniaRepublic of Macedonia, as a relatively young democratic country, gained its independence in the so-called‘third wave of democratization’, i.e. in the year 1991 following the dissolution of the Socialist FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia. Regarding the political pattern, Macedonia relies upon parliamentary democracywith an executive government elected by a unicameral parliament. The Assembly (parliament) is made upof 123 seats and the members are elected every four years. The role of the President of the Republic ismostly ceremonial and the real /executive power rests in the hands of the Government which makes theprime minister the most politically powerful person in the country. Various political indicators of democracyand good governance indicate that the democratisation of the society is an ongoing process or, in otherwords, the society is still in a process of democratic transition4.The country is located in the central Balkan Peninsula in Southeast Europe, with a total populationof around 2 million. A quarter of the population (approximately 500,000) is located in the biggest city andcapital, Skopje. Most residents are concentrated in the urban areas i.e. in moderately sized cities with apopulation of more than 20, 000.According to the ethnic composition of the population, Macedonian society is regarded as amultiethnic, multicultural and multiconfessional. Despite the Macedonian majority (66, 6%) there are otherethnic communities living on the territory of the Republic of Macedonia: Albanian ethnic community (22,7%), Turkish (4, 0%), Serbian (2, 1%), Vlachs (0, 4%) and others (1, 9%). Regarding the religious affiliation,67% of the population belongs to the Christian- orthodox religion and 30% to Islam.4 According to Linz and Stepan (1996) a democratic transition is complete when a sufficient agreement has been reached aboutpolitical procedures to produce an elected government, when a government comes to power that is the direct result of a free andpopular vote, when this government de facto has the authority to generate new policies, and when the executive, legislative andjudicial powers generated by the new democracy does not have to share the power with the other bodies de jure.Open Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 59Ganka Cvetanova and Bojana Naumovska: “Democratic Valuues and Political Attitudes of the Macedonian Young People”EQPAM Volume 5 No.2 April 2016ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916All of these ethnic communities living in the Republic of Macedonia, including the Macedonianmajority, have their own cultures created in accordance with the cultural history of the group they belong to.They have different cultural and value systems, different patterns of social life, language, religion, traditionand customs. The overlapping of the divisions among the ethnic communities - primarily due to theirdifferent ethnic belonging, religious affiliation and usage of different language - makes the Macedoniansociety even more fragile. This division is particularly accentuated between the Macedonian majority andthe biggest ethnic community – Albanian (Cvetanova, 2014: 35).The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the Republic of Macedonia was 5110 $/per capita (2013)5.The unemployment rate in Macedonia amounts to 27, 6% (as per the fourth quarter of 2014)6, whereas inthe case of the youngest population aged 15 to 24 it amounts to 50, 4%. According to the researchers’estimations the unemployment rate among the young population aged 15 to 297 amounts to 45, 5%(Jakimovski, 2014:22)The total number of young people in Macedonia aged 15 to 29 is 457 4778 or 23% of the totalpopulation. According to the data of the State Statistical Office obtained on the basis of received reports,there were 57 746 enrolled students in the Republic of Macedonia in the academic year 2013/2014, anincrease of 1.5% compared to the academic year 2012/2013. The number of enrolled female students was31 450 or 54.5%. The majority of students, 88.5%, were enrolled in public tertiary institutions, while 11.1%were enrolled in private tertiary institutions.4. Interest in PoliticsAccording to Oxford Dictionary of Politics, political participation refers to taking part in politics. Althoughpolitical discussion does not fit in with this classic definition of political participation, yet it is an importantfeature of democratic citizenship. Political discussion can also mean an attempt to influence givengovernment policy or the selection of government leaders who create government policies. When it comesto contemporary democratic systems, citizens are allowed to discuss their problems freely, express andvoice their dissatisfaction and complaints and request changes. (Atanasov, Cvetanova, 2013: 33).Pursuant to the survey research ‘Youth Trends in the Republic of Macedonia’, the largest numberof respondents stated that they were partly interested in politics (51, 6%), whereas 8, 8% stated that theywere very interested in politics. Approximately 40% of the respondents stated that they were not interestedin politics at all (Cekic, 2014: 62-64).Even though the direction is the same, the focal point of the survey research ‘Real and VirtualIdentities’ is students. Certain deviations are noticeable in this survey research, i.e. the interest in politicalissues is evident in a greater number of respondents. Hence, 18,2% of the students responded that theywere very interested in politics, 32,9% responded that they were not interested in this topic at all, whereasthe other half of students responded that they were partly interested in politics (48,7%). Male students aremore interested in politics compared to female students, and the same applies to the members of theAlbanian ethnic group as opposed to the Macedonian ethnic group. In this context, 28, 6% of male studentsand 12, 2% of female students stated that they were very interested in politics, whereas the percentage of5 http://kushnirs.org/macroeconomics/gdp/gdp_macedonia.html (30.03.2015)6 State Statistical Office, Labour Market, http://www.stat.gov.mk/pdf/2015/2.1.15.04.pdf (20.04 2015)7 The State Statistical Office does not keep this category as a special one, and therefore the researchers’ estimations have beentaken as relevant ones8 Official data from the State Statistical Office of the Republic of Macedonia and the latest estimations of the population dated31.12.2013 were used taking into account that the latest census of the population was conducted in the year 2002.Open Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 60European Quarterly of Political Attitudes and Mentalities EQPAMVolume 5, No.2, April 2016ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916the response ‘I am partly interested’ is almost identical in the case of the two groups. A lack of interest inpolitics among female students could be interpreted in the light of a generally negative attitude to womenand their representation and participation in politics due to the traditional and conservative values which aretypical for the cultural background of the people living in Macedonia. This negative attitude is reflected inthe number of women in politics which is significantly lower compared to the number of men, particularly interms of the executive and local government (Cvetanova, Naumovska, 2014: 26).With reference to ethnicity, 26,4% of students from the Albanian ethnic group stated that they werevery interested in politics as opposed to only 14,1% of the Macedonians who produced the same response.The increased interest in politics among the students that belong to the Albanian ethnic community,as opposed to Macedonians, is probably due to the fact that they consider the implementation of the OhridFramework Agreement, i.e. the resolving of ethnic issues as an open and still ongoing process (Cvetanova,Naumovska, 2014: 25).4.1 Where do they get information about politics and do they use news media?Despite the fact that the access to the Internet and the ever more increased use of social networks havedominated as a starting point in obtaining information, the survey research indicates that in the Republic ofMacedonia television still plays a pivotal role when it comes to obtaining information about political issues.In accordance with the data derived from the survey research ‘Youth Study Macedonia 2013’, 87, 9% of theyoung people obtain information about political issues from the television, 75, 9% from the Internet,followed by 52, 7% who obtain information from discussions with their friends, 52, 2% from discussions withfamily members, 42, 4% who use the newspapers and 27, 2% who use the radio as a source ofinformation. The presented findings point out to the fact that the young use different sources of informationwhen building their attitudes and viewpoints (Topuzovska Latkovikj et all. 2013: 97).The findings from the survey research ‘Youth Trends in the Republic of Macedonia’ gives us acomprehensive image of the interest in politics among the young people compared to other day-to-daytopics. The findings indicated that the first most searched topic in media for almost half of the young(46,5%) was information regarding celebrities, music and/or film, followed by information about political oreconomic affairs (16,2%), information pertaining to sports events and athletes (15,5%) and topicspertaining to culture (13,4%). The lowest number of respondents (6, 1%) search the media for informationregarding crime and corruption. Interest in political and economic affairs as the first most searched contentis unsurprisingly higher among the oldest respondents (aged 25 to 29, represented by 27, 7%), and lowestamong the youngest (aged 15 to 19, represented by 4, 5%). As for ethnicity, there is a significantdifference, i.e. information pertaining to economic and political affairs is twice more searched as a primarytopic among the Albanian respondents (25, 2%) compared to the Macedonian respondents (11%)(Babunski, 2014: 72, 73).4.2 How often young people discuss about politics with their friends?An indicator that highlights the genuine interest and the role that politics plays in the day-to-day life of theyoung people is the response to the question of how often they discuss politics with their friends. Incompliance with the data derived from the survey research ‘Real and Virtual Identities’, the responsesprovided were as follow: very often 17, 8%, sometimes 61, 6% and never 19, 8%. Nonetheless, theinformation obtained by interrelation of the questions “Are you interested in politics?” and “How often doyou discuss politics with your friends?” and the cross tabulation is that 47, 8% of the respondents who areOpen Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 61Ganka Cvetanova and Bojana Naumovska: “Democratic Valuues and Political Attitudes of the Macedonian Young People”EQPAM Volume 5 No.2 April 2016ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916not interested in politics sometimes discuss these topics with their friends. (Cvetanova, Naumovska, 2014:27).With reference to the interest in politics, the results indicate that the largest number of respondentsare partly interested in these issues, but at the same time they indicate that almost one half of therespondents discuss politics even though they are not interested in it. This may be due to the ongoingprocess of democratic transition and the continual changes in each and every segment of social life. This isfurther conditioned by the high rate of unemployment which is particularly pronounced in the case of theyoung population. These issues are included in the programs and policies of any government and theirregulation is crucial for the young.4.3 Civic and Political EngagementCitizen engagement may be defined as a process in which ordinary people take part – whether on avoluntary or obligatory basis and whether acting alone or as part of a group – with the goal of influencing adecision involving significant choices that will affect their community. Such engagement may or may nottake place within an institutional framework, and it may be organized either by members of civil society (forexample, through class action, demonstrations, citizens’ committees, etc.) or by decision-makers (forexample, through referendums, parliamentary commissions and mediation (André, 2010). As Longo andMeyer (2006) claim, the strength of any democratic society lies in an actively engaged citizenry.4.3.1 Civic EngagementThe study ‘Youth Trends in the Republic of Macedonia’ elaborates on the civic engagement ofyoung people in Macedonia, as within the educational institutions, and in a broader social context.According to the collected data, 43, 6% of the young involved in the educational process take part in settingrequirements within the school/university. A slightly lower percentage of respondents (33%) at leastsometimes resort to protests that have not been announced, but which they regard as fair.As far as the civic engagement of young people in a wider social context is concerned (beyond theeducational institutions), somewhat different results have been obtained – a lower engagement on the partof the young has been registered. Namely, 29,4% of the young take part in setting requirements, whereas34,2% of the young have at least once signed a petition or have resorted to certain previously announcedprotests. A slightly lower percentage of respondents (27, 9%) at least sometimes resort to protests thathave not been announced, but which they regard as fair (Cekic, 2014: 67, 68).Although non-political in its nature, participation in socially useful work i.e. in non-profit services forthe benefit of the community is another fundamental aspect of democratic society and democraticcitizenship. Participation in civic associations is not just important only because it develops civic skills, butalso because it is critical to establishing social and political networks that are so important for politicalactivity. Associating with other citizens about any interest on any basis increases the probability ofestablishing contact with government and for active involvement in politics. As Nie and Hillygus (2001)claim, even members of a garden club can be drawn into politics because the government controls whatseeds can be grown and what fertilizers should be used.Hence, the findings in terms of youth engagement in civic associations in Macedonia, presented inthe study ‘Youth Trends in the Republic of Macedonia’, may even be regarded pessimistic. Namely, a highpercentage of young people, i.e. 53, 8% are not members of any organization. As for those that areengaged (multiple choice answers allowed), the highest percentage of engagement is evident in sports/recreation organizations (11, 9%), humanitarian organizations (11, 7%), student/high school organizationsOpen Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 62European Quarterly of Political Attitudes and Mentalities EQPAMVolume 5, No.2, April 2016ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916(11%), cultural/arts organizations (9, 4%), youth organizations (9, 3%), political parties (9, 3%), religiousorganizations (6%) and human rights organizations (5, 8%) (Cekic, 2014: 67, 68).4.3.2 Political EngagementOne of the crucial indicators pertaining to the engagement of the young people in politics is the useof the democratic right to vote. Voting represents a higher level of political activity compared to thepreviously processed ones and is the most immediate way to assess the attitude of the young towardspolitics (for example whether it is a case of apathy, etc.). Unfortunately, there is no information about voterturnout in Macedonia with reference to age groups, which further implies that only research-based datamay be used as indicators of this phenomenon.According to the findings presented in ‘Youth Study Macedonia 2013’, 41% of the youngresponded that they have always voted at elections, whereas 31% responded that they have voted severaltimes. Having in mind that 19% of the respondents are not eligible to vote, only 7% of the young peopleresponded that they have never voted. Hence, the authors of this study are of the opinion that there areother reasons that motivate the young people to go out and vote having in mind that the interest in politicson the part of the young is noticeably lower. In conformity with the data obtained, it is the ethnicMacedonians that most often vote in elections, whereas the ethnic Albanians and members of the smallercommunities more seldom vote. The difference among ethnic communities grouped in such a way isapproximately 10%. (Topuzovska Latkovikj et all. 2013).As far as the same question is concerned, there are minor discrepancies among the data obtainedfrom the survey research ‘Youth Trends in the Republic of Macedonia’ which may be due to the providedmodalities9. According to this survey research, approximately one half of the respondents almost alwaysvote (49, 8%), 22, 7% sometimes use their right to vote, and only 7, 3% of the respondents stated that theyhave never voted (having in mind that the target group of the survey research was young people between15 and 29 years of age, 20, 2% are not eligible to vote). Excluding the young people who are not eligible tovote, it could be inferred that 58% of the young who are eligible to vote have almost always voted, whereas28, 5% have voted sometimes (Cekic: 2014: 64, 65).The existence of trust towards political leaders and political parties, in most cases is anindicator of the attitude of young people towards politics and occasionally it affects their decision aboutmore pro-active engagement in activities with reference to the political processes in any society.Two questions from the survey research ‘Youth Study Macedonia 2013’ (2013: 27, 97, 98) illustratethe young people’s trust towards the political leaders and political parties.By employing the Likert scale ranging from 1 to 10 (1 being ‘I do not trust them at all’, and 10 being‘I trust them completely’) and referring to 10 social groups and individuals, the young people expressedtheir level of trust. The trust they have towards the political leaders and towards the people with differentpolitical convictions is the lowest. As far as the political leaders are concerned, the mean value is 3, 18,whereas the level of trust towards people with different political convictions is characterized by a meanvalue of 4, 29, which may be a sole indicator of the existence of a politicized and a divided society.Additionally, the figures regarding the trust towards the political parties are the lowest compared toall other provided answers (a total of 16), i.e. compared to all indicated public and private institutions, aswell as international organizations, media, nongovernmental organizations, religious organizations, trade9 Namely, the answer ‘I always vote’ was provided as a first answer in the first study research, whereas the answer ‘I almostalways vote’ was provided as first answer in the second survey research.Open Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 63Ganka Cvetanova and Bojana Naumovska: “Democratic Valuues and Political Attitudes of the Macedonian Young People”EQPAM Volume 5 No.2 April 2016ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916unions and banks. On a scale from 1 to 4 (1 being ‘I do not trust them at all’ and 4 being ‘I trust them verymuch’), the mean value of political parties is 1, 95.On the basis of the presented findings and pertaining to the level of trust that the young peoplehave towards the political leaders and political parties it may be inferred that it is on a rather low level. Thesurvey research highlights that the lack of trust or the low level of trust towards these political entitiesresults in apathy among citizens. Nevertheless, despite the low level of trust towards political leaders andpolitical parties, apathy is non-existent among the Macedonian young people.5. Young People and Macedonian SocietyTaking into account that the Macedonian society is still regarded as a society in democratic transition, oneof the key elements of consideration regarding the awareness towards democracy of the young people inMacedonia is their perception of the democratic development. In this sense, the following attitudes andviewpoints were taken into consideration: their satisfaction with reference to democratic development of theMacedonian society; their willingness to stay or leave the country and the type of society they would like tolive in.According to Youth Study Macedonia 2013, as far as the satisfaction with reference to democraticdevelopment of the Macedonian society is concerned, the mean value of answers from the overall sampleis M=2,74 (on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 denotes very disappointed, whereas 5 denotes very satisfied).Girls are more satisfied with the democratic development (M=2, 85) as opposed to boys (M=2, 63) and thesame applies to the members of the Albanian ethnic community (M=2, 54) as opposed to the members ofthe Macedonian ethnic community (M=2, 39). There is a statistically significant difference in both presentedcases (T. Latkovikj et all. 2013: 112). The fact that the members of the Albanian ethnic community are moresatisfied with the democratic development in the Republic of Macedonia compared to the Macedonians isprobably due to the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement10, in particular concessionsmade11, and the implemented affirmative measures12 for the benefit of the ethnic communities. This attitudeof young Albanians fully corresponds with the attitude of the wider Albanian community. Namely, membersof the Albanian ethnic community are of the opinion that with the implementation of the Ohrid FrameworkAgreement, Macedonia finally acquired the model of political system thus enabling Albanians to earn theirwell-deserved status in society (Cvetanova, 2014: 37).Probably, due to the fact that young Albanian respondents are more satisfied with the democraticdevelopment in the Republic of Macedonia, they – in much higher percentage compared to youngMacedonians – would like to remain to live in the country.10 The Ohrid Framework Agreement ended the seven-month armed conflict between the Albanian Paramilitary Formation calledNational Liberation Army and Macedonian security forces in 2001. The objective of the Agreement was to meet the requirementson the part of the Albanian ethnic community in Macedonia, but at the same time for the purpose of preserving the unitarycharacter of the state. The Document incorporated both general principles and suggestions for solving concrete interethnicproblems, such as: decentralization, non-discrimination in public service, special parliamentary procedures for changing theconstitution and other major laws, education and language matters, as well as the expression of identity. The Agreement wasimplemented in the Constitution and laws of the Republic of Macedonia.11 It primarily refers to the use of languages of the ethnic communities. According to the Ohrid Framework Agreement the officiallanguage throughout Macedonia and in the international relations of Macedonia is the Macedonian language. But - as stated inthe Agreement - with respect to local self-government, in municipalities where a community comprises at least 20 percent of thepopulation of the municipality, the language of that community will be used as an official language in addition to Macedonian.With respect to languages spoken by less than 20 percent of the population of the municipality, the local authorities will decidedemocratically on their use in public bodies.12 Appropriate and fair representation of the members of the ethnic communities in the public and state administration.Open Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 64European Quarterly of Political Attitudes and Mentalities EQPAMVolume 5, No.2, April 2016ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916But, first of all, we should consider the overall data from Youth Study Macedonia 2013 regardingthis issue. Namely, one half of the respondents, i.e. 53% of the young people, is thinking of (31%) or hasalready decided (22%) to leave Macedonia. The most desired destination among the young people is theWestern Europe countries. This destination is opted for by 55% of the respondents, followed by the USAand/or Canada, opted for by 25%. Financial reasons are the key motive for leaving the country of origin, asstated by 65% of the young people. One third of the young people (33%) who are thinking of leaving thecountry, are planning to remain there forever (Topuzovska Latkovikj et all. 2013: 56).As before mentioned, there are noticeably different migration trends among the young Macedonianand Albanian people. A total of 55% of the surveyed young Macedonians are planning to leave the country,as opposed to 57% of the members of the Albanian ethnic community that are not thinking of leaving thecountry and going abroad. This trend is further acknowledged by the survey research Real and VirtualIdentities.As evident from the enclosed table, the percentage of respondents that agree with the statement ‘Iwill remain to live in Macedonia’ is greater among the Albanian students (Table 1).Table 1. “I will remain to live in Macedonia”I fully agree I partly agreeI do not agreeNo answerMacedoniansAlbaniansTotal5211,8%7030,4%12618,1%13029,5%5021,7%18426,4%17940,7%5724,8%24835,6%7918%5323%13819,8%In 2001 - as a result of the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement a new politicalpattern was inaugurated in Macedonia. Hence, it is of great importance to take into consideration theattitudes of young people towards the type of society (in terms of political pattern) they would like to live in.According to the collected data from the research project Real and Virtual Identities, 45, 7% of therespondents opted for civil, 39, 5% for multicultural and 2, and 4% opted for bi-ethnic. The greateststatistically relevant difference is evident when this question is analyzed from the aspect of ethnicity.It may be inferred that the percentage of respondents that are in favour of the civil society is higheramong the Macedonian students, whereas the percentage of respondents that are in favour of themulticultural society is higher among the Albanian students (Figure 1).Open Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 65706050403020100Ganka Cvetanova and Bojana Naumovska: “Democratic Valuues and Political Attitudes of the Macedonian Young People”EQPAM Volume 5 No.2 April 2016ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916MacedoniansAlbaniansMulticulturalBi-ethnicCivicDon't knowFigure 1. “What type of society would you like to live in?” (Ethnic Variable)It is evident that the division among the ethnic communities in Macedonia - particularly accentuatedbetween the Macedonian majority and the biggest ethnic community (Albanian) – is reflected in differentviews and opinions regarding the concept of the political pattern. In other words, young Albanians prefermulticultural society rather than civil one. It should be emphasized that the newly inaugurated politicalpattern shifted the focal point from individual to collective rights (the ethnic ones) and on behalf of the largercommunities, thus enabling the individual to realize his/her rights (economic, social, cultural, political)through the ethnic community they belong to. This political pattern inevitably leads to a sheer model ofethnic pluralism with elements of consociational democracy instead to the declared multiculturalendeavours (Cvetanova, 2007: 153, 2014: 37).6. ConclusionsThe democratization of the Macedonian society – as a society in democratic transition – is largelydependent on the democratic awareness of its citizens and their political viewpoints and values. In thiscontext, the willingness of the citizens and of the young people in particular is of pivotal importance withreference to their engagement and participation in all political and civic activities within the society.Nonetheless, the findings from the conducted research in Macedonia point out to certainindifference and disengagement in terms of the political and civic activities of the young people.The fact that there are major differences among the young people pertaining to their interest inpolitics and their satisfaction with the democratic development of the society is of particular interest and it isworth highlighting. This fact is even more remarkable from the aspect of their ethnicity.Namely, the young people of Albanian ethnicity, as opposed to the young Macedonians, are moreinterested, discuss politics more and are consequently much more informed about the current politicalaffairs in the Republic of Macedonia. This is probably due to the fact that the Albanian ethnic community inMacedonia is of the opinion that the ethnic issues (minority and cultural rights) have not been fully realized,and hence their interest in the current political affairs in the country is greater. The different viewpoints andOpen Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 66European Quarterly of Political Attitudes and Mentalities EQPAMVolume 5, No.2, April 2016ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916visions concerning the political structure further prove this. The young Macedonians, who constitute amajority, would like the Macedonian society to be a civic, as opposed to the young Albanians who envisageit as a multicultural.On the other hand, certain contradiction has been ascertained regarding the level of satisfactionwith the democratic development of the society in the case of the young Albanians. Compared to the otherethnic communities, including the Macedonian majority, the young Albanians are most satisfied with thedemocratic development of the society. Hence, the percentage of respondents who stated that they wouldnot like to leave the country and would like to remain in Macedonia for ever is the highest among the youngAlbanians.As for the engagement in civic associations, there are no differences pertaining to ethnicity. Thegenerally weak engagement of the young people in Macedonia, which is ultimately pessimistic, indicatesnon-existence of awareness regarding the relevance and significance of such engagement. Namely,participation in civic associations is not just important because it develops civic skills, but also because it iscritical to establishing social and political networks that are so important for political activity. Associatingwith other citizens about any interest on any basis increases the probability of establishing contact withgovernment and for active involvement in politics.Regarding the trust towards political leaders and political parties, despite the low level of trust,apathy is non-existent among the Macedonian young people when it comes to their electoral participation.The identification of causes of such a phenomenon is crucial for our society, which is an additional impetusto research this topic further.Nevertheless, further systematic and comprehensive research of the political viewpoints andvalues of the young people in Macedonia is needed, in addition to continual observance of their civic andpolitical engagement, taking into account that the successful democratization of any society depends on thelevel of democratic awareness of its citizens and their willingness to be actively involved in political andcivic activities.References<ref>Atanasov, P.
