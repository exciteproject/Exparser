Irina BusyginaMikhail FilippovNORTHERN DIMENSION:PARTICIPANTSTRATEGIESIrina Busygina, Mikhail FilippovThis article is devoted to the “Northern Dimen-sion” initiative of the EU which also includesNorth-West Russia, Norway and Iceland. It is notedthat the “Northern Dimension” in the theoreticalperspective can be considered as part of strategicmulti-level interactions between member-states ofthe EU and Russia. On this basis, the authors ana-lyze implications and effects of the strategic inter-dependence of all the EU-Russia relation levels.Key words: European Union (EU), Russia,the “Northern Dimension” (ND), cross-bordercooperation, inter-regional cooperation, sub-sidiarity in the EU foreign policy.The EU “Northern Dimension” initiative was put forward by Finland in1997 and was first adopted by the European Commission as a strategy of theEU for 2000—2003 in 1999. The key element of the “Northern Dimension”is the development of cross-border cooperation between separate administra-tive units of member states. In accordance with the EU documents, it in-cludes the territories of Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Baltic States andPoland, as well as Karelia, the Murmansk, Arkhangelsk, Leningrad, Pskov,Novgorod, Vologda, Kaliningrad regions of the Russian Federation andSaint-Petersburg.The unique character of the “Northern Dimension” programme (ND) liesin cooperation between participants conducted both vertically and horizon-tally at several levels: the state, regional and local ones. For Russia, the NDmeans an additional possibility to attract the attention of partners to the useof resources located in underdeveloped areas, as well as to find joint solu-tions to the problems of the Russian North-West cross border areas [2,p. 180]. For instance: environment protection, transport and border infra-structure, unemployment and healthcare problems and other issues.The development of the ND is, to a great extent, an activity in theframework of certain policies. But it has a distinct horizontal dimension,where coordination plays a significant role. Interaction and coordination ofthe EU instruments and international finance institutions can provide forhigher efficiency and lead to practical results, especially in fundingIn 2003, the European Commission adopted the Second Northern Di-mension Action Plan for 2004—2006. The second ND was aimed at contrib-uting to the implementation of the Neighbourhood policy. Now, two partner-ships are taking place in the ND framework: the Environmental Partnershipand Partnership in Public Health and Social Well-being (established in ac-cordance with the Declaration adopted at the Oslo International Conferenceon October 27—28, 2003). In four years, the Environmental Partnership hasproved itself an efficient multilateral cooperation mechanism with an ade-quate financial base and project manager — The European Bank for Recon-47Development strategies of the Baltic regionstruction and Development. The total amount of funding is 1.8 billion euros.Fifteen projects are being implemented in the Partnership framework that aremainly financed by international development banks on a repayable basis,while a part of finance is provided by the Special Environmental PartnershipFoundation as grants.The first priority projects in the framework of the partnership are South-Eastern sewage disposal plants in Saint Petersburg (completed in 2005), theflood protection system in Saint Petersburg, the sludge combustion plant inSaint Petersburg (completed in 2007), the environmental investment pro-gramme for the Leningrad region; modernisation of housing and public utili-ties in Arkhangelsk, Syktyvkar and Novgorod, the modernisation of centralheating systems in Kaliningrad and Murmansk, the organisation of wastemanagement in Kaliningrad, cessation of waste disposal into the Neva, theLadoga ecological programme, water supply in Kaliningrad and Vologda [3,p. 31].Though the ND initiative was highly criticized from the beginning, it ledto certain tangible results. Perhaps, its main advantage is the contribution tothe efficient involvement of Russia into European structures beyond the so-called “high politics”. The interest in the ND, its implementation and theo-retical experience are expanding beyond Northern Europe and immediateparticipant states [6].However, the ND initiative is not merely interesting in itself, but also inthe context of EU-Russia relations. From a theoretical perspective, the NDcan be considered an element of strategically connected multilevel interac-tions between the EU member states and Russia. Researchers have repeat-edly emphasised the principal importance of the multilevel character of rela-tions between these actors. It concerns (1) relations between the EU andRussian institutions; (2) bilateral Russia-the EU member states relations; (3)cross-border relations and cooperation at regional (subnational) level [12].Proceeding from this, we can take the next step and try to analyse the conse-quences and effects of strategic interdependence between all Russia-the EUrelation levels in more details.Our basic argument is that both actors interacting at numerous institu-tional levels and balancing between them are trying to achieve differentgoals at the same time. The key actors should take into account the conse-quences of interaction at different levels, but at the same time they differ-ently estimate the results of these interactions. Thus the choice or rejectionof cooperation strategy (or tactics) at one level can explain the character ofdecisions made at other levels.The EU-Russia Relations: General ContextRecently, the EU-Russia relations have developed in a peculiar manner:there is a growing discrepancy between the actively developing trade andforeign policy relations, which are approaching the ‘freezing point’. In 2007,this discrepancy formed a steady tendency, since trade was developing to thebenefit of both parties, while the sphere of external relations was increas-48Irina Busygina, Mikhail Filippovingly taking forms unfavourable for Russia, significantly weakening theinternational position of Russia not only at the present moment, but also forthe future. The middle of 2007 conceivably saw the transition to a princi-pally new paradigm of the EU standpoints in its relation to Russia — Euro-pean leaders admitted the inadequacy of the attempts to influence the re-forms in Russia and started establishing mechanisms aimed at the elabora-tion of joint solutions allowing neutralisation of possible negative actions ofRussia towards the EU.The favourable vector of international relations development reached itsmaximum in 1997 when, finally, the EU-Russia Partnership and CooperationAgreement, signed in 1994, came into effect. At that moment, the Treaty ofAmsterdam defined the constitutional (contractual) principles of the EUforeign policy.Relations with Russia were considered a general foreign policy projectthat is characterised by the concordance of the member state objectives, Atthe same time it would be a “pilot project” to test new mechanisms of theinteraction of the EU (as a body) with the outer world. It was crucial to findsuch a project, because the difficulty of the EU common policy developmentconsists in contradictory foreign policy interests of different states, first ofall, Germany, France and the UK. But, since all the EU member states areinterested in the predictability of Russia, the provision of this predictabilityis the most evident first priority project of the new common foreign policy[1]. The Treaty of Amsterdam defined the EU “common strategies” in for-eign policy as one of the most important instruments of the EU foreign pol-icy. The first “common strategy” (adopted in June 1999) was the programmeaimed at the development of democracy and market competition in Russia.In general, it was expected by means of joint efforts it would be possible toinfluence Russia in the same way Western victorious powers influenced thedevelopment of post-war Germany and Japan, aspiring to the establishmentof democracy and competitive market as basic tools of a predictable good-neighbour policy. It is well-know that states with democratically electedgovernments cannot allow themselves to be at enmity with each other.In summer 1999, it could seem that Russia got an opportunity to benefitfrom the interest of the EU states in the success of their first foreign policyproject aimed at the transformation of Russia into a democratic Europeanpower, consistent with the common European rules. But soon after VladimirPutin had come to power, Russia started resisting the EU attempts to conductcommon foreign policy towards Russia. First of all, Russia tried to take ad-vantage of the contradictions within the EU. But soon the attempts to takeadvantage of the contradictions and, especially, to oppose ‘old’ Europe to thenew members of the EU proved to be counterproductive. It became evidentin 2007, when, unexpectedly for the Russian diplomacy, Poland blocked thesubscription of the new PCA planned at the EU-Russia summit in Samara,which Russia had been aiming at for five years. The leaders of the Union didnot merely refrained from calling Poland to ‘order’, but at the summit itself(which was not successful due to the Polish veto) Manuel Barroso, the Presi-dent of the European Commission, firmly declared his support to Poland.49Development strategies of the Baltic regionIt is important to mention, that one of the peculiarities of the EU is thefact that this intergovernmental structure is still undergoing the process offormation. It defines, to a great extent, the foreign policy strategies of theUnion, which are motivated more by attempts to create conditions for thefurther accretion of the power to make the EU a real actor of foreign policythan by the EU foreign policy interests. Thus member states should reject themost significant part of their sovereignty which needs serious stimuli. Now,economic cooperation in the framework of the EU has almost reached thelevel of a federative union; and the Union represents the interests of all themember states. In other spheres, first of all, in foreign policy, solidarity islimited: the principles of decision-making have an intergovernmental charac-ter, i.e. a decision is made only if the member states reached an accord. Itmeans that the mechanism of formulating “common interests” in this spherehas not been elaborated yet; there is only a “common denominator” of dif-ferent interests.The prerequisite — the EU has not formed a mechanism of formulatingcommon interests — sometimes brings Russian diplomats to the false con-clusion that it is possible (and one should try) to take advantage of the con-tradictions between the EU member states. At the same time they do not takeinto account that for many European politicians the basic interest consists inestablishing common institutes (rules) of the EU foreign policy. Despitedifferent positions on certain issues, there is a collective comprehension ofthe necessity to elaborate rules defining the future development of the EUforeign policy.However, the increasing political tension between the EU and Russia canbe ‘compensated’ by cooperation at other institutional levels. So, politicalfrictions at the highest level can stimulate the participation of the Russiangovernment in regional EU initiatives (such as the ND). At the same time, itis crucial that, in order to succeed in this balancing between levels, the NDcontext should be separated from the problem field of the ‘high politics’. Inthis case, cross-border and interregional programme(s) will be more efficientif they are concentrated around local and not political issues. One shouldadmit that such programmes are hardly applicable to such ‘highly’ politi-cised issues as the development of democracy in Russia, the freedom of me-dia, human rights, security and energy resource supply. In other words, ex-perts working at both practical and ideological levels of the ND should con-sciously avoid being involved in certain (political) problems.It is possible to assume that if some actors choose the level of EU-Russiarelations in general as a priority; others will be interested in the developmentof bilateral relations. So, the priorities of different actors will differ. In gen-eral, it can be expected that the EU member states and subnational territories(regions) will follow different and, maybe, contradictory strategies towardsRussia. Moreover, the same actor will conduct different strategies at differ-ent institutional levels. For instance, Finland will act differently in the Euro-pean Council, in the ND, and in bilateral relations with Russia. This lack ofconsistency in EU foreign policy is a natural consequence of its multilevelgovernmental structure.50Irina Busygina, Mikhail FilippovThe development of the ND is a good example of how the tension in the‘high politics’ do not restrict cooperation at lower levels. Different forms ofinterregional cooperation in the framework of the ND achieved more signifi-cant progress that it was expected by the critics of the initiative. Despitenumerous difficulties, the initiative was not seriously affected and involved inthe deteriorating relations between Russia and the EU and, what is most impor-tant, Russia did not withdraw from the initiative maintaining its liabilities.The Formula of Success: Small Steps of Small PowersAs Aalto shows [4], the ND was, first of all, an attempt to overcome theincreasing demarcation between the EU and Russia by means of finding jointsolutions to functional problems and not meeting at another ‘high politics’battle field. Security and political issues were either excluded from theagenda or discussed in brief. Maybe, the best decision was not to tackle theissue of oil and gas supply in mass media. Only nuclear safety and energyefficiency were included in the ND Environmental Partnership. The impor-tance of the North for the EU energy strategy is understood by ‘Europeanbureaucrats’ perfectly well: “The Northern Dimension represents one essen-tial frontier for security of supply due to the importance of Russian andNorwegian energy supplies.” (The EU Commission 1999:11).From the very beginning, the ND was oriented towards partnership andequality approach, was open to equal partnership of non-EU member states.As Lannon and Elsuwege point out: “The fact that these partner countrieshave become involved in the process from the very beginning and partici-pated in the Foreign Ministers’ conferences on the Northern Dimension israther unusual in the EU context. In other words, the partner countries wereexpected to be not only policy-takers but also policy-makers” [9, p. 25].Browning and Joenniemi [5] agree that openness to external participants isindeed a peculiar feature of the ND. For all member-states this involvementinto the initiative grants an opportunity and grounds for the discussion ofurgent problems on the basis of equality. The equality and partnership ap-proach almost guaranteed that the ND would deal with a certain number ofissues, ‘acceptable’ for all participants. And indeed, the ND, as a rule, con-ducts functional cooperation in the field of ‘low’ politics.Later, Finland started to make efforts to transform the image of the ND— from a foreign policy to a cooperation project that equally belonged to theparticipant states and the EU [14, p. 6]. From all the partner states onlyFinland is a member of the EMU, but is still sceptical about a common de-fence policy. For an outside observer, the ND may seem a project, in theframework of which Northern European States try to separately build theirrelations with the rest of the world and Russia in particular. The ND can bealso considered as a ‘Northern alternative’ to the eastern and southern vec-tors of the EU development. As Trenin assumes [13] there is a possibility offorming a new common global identity — the ‘Northern’ one.It was repeatedly emphasized that the ND proves the ability of small EUpowers to achieve much conducting ‘smart small policies’. If in the case of51Development strategies of the Baltic regionRussia, it concerns the regions that actively participated in the ND activityand success depended to a great extend on the interest and involvement oflocal and regional (subnational) actors.It is not a coincidence that such initiatives and projects are implementedat subnational level — it demands, in addition, the technology of practically-oriented cooperation. The attempts to harmonise and realise such projectsamong national governments inevitably lead to significant transaction costs.On the contrary, interregional contacts allow keeping costs low; cooperationis developing as a ‘general practice’ beyond the ‘high’ policy context.EU Foreign Policy Subsidiarity Principleand Northern DimensionThe development of “dimensions” is a form of exclusion: partnership ina certain dimension means that the state cannot count on full membership inthe Union [8, p. 7]. The ND has both northern and eastern elements. Andfrom the point of view of its eastern “geography” it is indeed a border be-tween Europe and non-Europe [11]. If one understands the ND in this way,then it is based in Brussels in the offices where the EU foreign policy is be-ing elaborated [11, p. 97]. In other words, if one conceptualises the ND as anelement of the EU foreign policy, then it becomes a restricted regional partof the common EU strategy towards Russia.Alternative future for the ND could consist in maintaining a certain de-gree of independence from the EU foreign policy; the ND already has impor-tant innovations and is different from the traditional instruments of foreignpolicy, which makes it easier to achieve autonomy. The ND is a combinationof the partnership, equality and multilevel approaches, and such a uniquecombination creates a “special subsidiarity form” — the EU states formulateand realise foreign policy in collaboration with external actors able to gener-ate necessary ‘power’ to solve certain problems [7, p. 390]. Such subsidiaryallows the EU to conduct its multilevel foreign policy. On the other hand, themost concerned member states can avoid the contradictions of ‘high’ politicsfocusing on those fields of cooperation where the participation of regionaland subregional actors will lead to the creation of additional value (theNorthern Dimension Policy Framework Document, 2006).The subsidiarity principle applied to the ND drastically differs from theideas of “two-speed Europe” and “Europe of regions”. Perhaps, it can beeasily explained by means of multilevel governance approach, which impliesthat the actors can influence the decision-making process in the EU by nu-merous means — from collaborating with European institutions to indirectactions through regional, national and subnational bodies. The policy thusformed is a result of overlapping jurisdictions, tensions and conflicts in themultilevel governance system [10].Applying this subsidiarity logic to the ND one can expect the process of‘localised’ decision making become decentralised, i. e. dispersed amongdifferent institutional levels — regional, national, subnational; while supra-national institutions will maintain responsibility for formulating the common52Irina Busygina, Mikhail Filippovpolicy towards Russia. Thus, different questions will be located in the juris-diction of different actor in dependence on their importance and presence ofcommon interest.Let us mention, that the ND subsidiarity logic does not contradict (butsupplements) our argument put forward in the beginning of the article: thekey actors will define their strategies in accordance with, firstly, the generalcontext of EU-Russia relations, and, secondly, prioritisation at different lev-els and concerning different issues. European (supranational) actors are morelikely to benefit from the participation of the ND in ‘high’ politics then theparticipant states, subnational units and the Region in general.Bibliography1. <ref>Бусыгина И.
