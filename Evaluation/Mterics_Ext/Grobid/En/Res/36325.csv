Performative Social Science and PsychologyMary M. Gergen & Kenneth J. Gergen∗Abstract: »Performative Sozialwissenschaft und Psychologie«. This articlepresents an overview of “Performative Social Science,” which is defined as thedeployment of different forms of artistic performance in the execution of a sci-entific project. Such forms may include art, theater, poetry, music, dance, pho-tography, fiction writing, and multi-media applications. Performative researchpractices are in their developmental stage, with most of the major work appear-ing in the last two decades. Frequently based on a social constructionistmetatheory, supporters reject a realist, or mapping view of representation, andexplore varieties of expressive forms for constructing worlds relevant to thesocial sciences. The performative orientation often relies on a dramaturgicalapproach that encompasses value-laden, emotionally charged topics and pres-entations. Social scientists invested in social justice issues and political per-spectives have been especially drawn to this approach. Performative social sci-ence invites productive collaborations among various disciplinary fields andbetween the sciences and arts.Keywords: art forms; multi-media; performance; social sciences; social con-struction; social justice.1. History and Disciplinary DispersionThe term “performative” is drawn from J.L. Austin’s work, “How to do Thingswith Words” (1962), in which he refers to the way in which utterances performvarious social functions over and above conveying content. Performative socialscience involves the deployment of different forms of artistic performance inthe execution of the scientific project (M. Gergen, 2001). Such forms mayinclude art, theater, poetry, music, dance, photography, fiction writing, andmulti-media applications (Madison & Hamera, 2006). Performance-orientedresearch may be presented in textual form, but also before live audiences, or invarious media forms (film, photographs, websites).∗ Address all communications to: Mary M.

These studies have generally been represented intraditional textual form. This summary excludes these types of performancestudies because they are not, in themselves, examples of performative research(cf. Carlson, 1996; Conquergood, 1992; Schechner, 1985, 2002; Turner, 1986).The exploration of performative research practices is in its nascent stage,with most of the major work appearing in the last two decades. However, inter-est in performatively oriented inquiry has been increasing rapidly. Lively con-troversy surrounds such efforts, in part because they raise significant questionsregarding the nature of science (Marcus, 1994). Further, such exploration callsattention to the various ways in which all methods of inquiry and representationare performances. Questions thus emerge as to their comparative efficacy interms of achieving social ends (K. Gergen, 2009). The use of theater in com-municating about the nature of prejudice, for example, has a far different im-pact on one’s audience than a graphic or statistical form of representation. Aperformative orientation to research often relies on dramaturgical theory in itsapproach to human action, although a commitment to such a theory is not re-quired by this orientation (Goffman, 1959; Newman & Holzman, 1996).The performative orientation to social research has many and varied roots,both within the social sciences and without. In philosophy the distinction be-tween science and art has long been questioned, with scholars pointing to thevarious ways in which scientific theory and descriptions are suffused withliterary tropes (e.g. metaphors, narratives), and guided by visual imagery (e.g.,waves, matrices). In this vein, science is not defined by virtue of its contrastwith performance; it is itself a form of performance (see, for example, Arn-heim, 1969; McCloskey, 1985). Sociologists have also had an interest in per-formance-oriented research. The field of visual sociology, emphasizing photog-raphy as a major means of illuminating the social world is but one realization(see the International Visual Sociology Association). For example, Mark DeRond, (2008a) in his ethnographic research of the University of Cambridgerowing team, produced a flash video called “From Nausea to Method: TheDark Night of the Ethnographer’s Soul” as well as a nonfiction book, “The LastAmateurs: To Hell and Back with the Cambridge Boat Race Crew” (2008b);De Rond describes his performative work as “carnal sociology.” Further, soci-ologists invested in liberation politics, have found dramatic performance amajor means of engaging people in social change movements. The work ofAugusto Boal (1995) is seminal in this respect. Jonathan Shailor’s work withprison populations (2010) is a recent realization of liberation theory. ManyParticipatory Action researchers also rely on performance practices in theirstudies (cf. Reason & Bradbury, 2000). For example, in her work with Guate-292malan women suffering from violence, Brinton Lykes has made extensive useof photography.1 In psychology, the earliest uses of performance were largelythose of therapists. Jacob Moreno (1947), Joseph Wolpe (1969), Eric Berne(1964) and George Kelly (1955) all played an important role in demonstratingthe ways in which performance may be used for exploration, both of one’s pastlife and of potentials for future action. Outside the social sciences, the late 20thcentury emergence of performance art has brought to attention the potentials ofuniting art and social commentary for stimulating social change (Carlson,1996).These early contributions paved the way for a more recent flourishing ofperformance oriented inquiry across a variety of disciplines. In Women’s Stud-ies, such developments have been stimulated in particular by the view of gen-der itself as a cultural performance – as opposed to a biological given (seeespecially Butler, 1990, 1993). Thus when we engage in culturally appropriatesex role behaviors, we are enacting roles as we have been taught to play them.Other feminists have explored sexuality, embodiment, and power throughperformative means (Lockford, 2004; Ronai, 1992). Issues of health and medi-cal treatment for women with breast cancer became the focus of a Canadiantheater production. This work, using patients playing roles related to their owndisease, was later published as “Standing Ovation” (Gray & Sinding, 2002).Performance forms have also been developed by scholars in Gay and Lesbianstudies. For example, after Colorado voters excluded homosexuals from stateanti-discrimination laws, psychologist Glenda Russell (2000; Russel & Bohan,1999) transformed filmed interviews from the event into a television program.This show, “Inner Journeys, Public Stands,” was then nationally televised. Theinterview materials were also used as the basis for an oratorio, “Fire,” com-posed by Bob McDowell and performed on several occasions (see Russell,2000).In the field of communication, important developments in performance haveemerged in ethnographic study. As scholars have developed autoethnographyto illustrate or illuminate various issues, so have they frequently experimentedwith forms of expression (Ellis, 1991; Ellis & Bochner, 1996; McCall, 2000;Pelias, 1999; see also Ellis, Adams & Bochner, 2010). Commonly, autoethno-graphy takes on the qualities of dramatic writing (Ellis, 2004; Richardson,1997). With his graduate students, James Scheurich has produced a “researchhappening,” designed to illuminate issues in immigration by bringing audiencemembers into interactive relations with artifacts and activities related to Mexi-can immigrants, as well as a movie, “Labores de la Vida/The Labors of Life,”with Miguel Guajardo and others (Scheurich, Guajardo, Sanchez & Fineman,1999) about migrant farm workers. Moving toward full-blown performance,1 <http://www2.bc.edu/~lykes/voices.htm>.293Johnny Saldaña, professor at Arizona State University, has transformed a storyfrom his adolescence into a theatrical piece called “Second Chair” (2008), withhis music as well as prose. Online presentations allow for greater visual impact,with diverse forms of dramatic forms, music and text. A Special Issue of FQSincluded 42 contributions, emphasizing performative research projects (Joneset al., 20082).In psychology, performance studies were highlighted at symposia presentedover a five year period, 1995-1999, at the American Psychological Associationnational meetings. Sessions were composed of dramatic monologues, dance,multi-media presentations, plays, and poems, all treating a significant topic ofpsychological concern. Another major innovator in performance studies is theEast Side Institute, where dramatic productions are integral to educational,therapeutic and community building functions (Newman & Holzman, 1996).Kenneth J. Gergen (2009) has co-created graphic and poetic representations oftheoretical views with artist, Regine Walter. Mary Gergen’s dramatic mono-logues and textual formats, lodged at the intersection of social construction andfeminist studies, are among the earliest performative presentations in psychol-ogy (K. Gergen & M. Gergen, 2001; M. Gergen, 2001).As many qualitative researchers find, the traditional distinctions among de-partments of knowledge are both artificial and insulating. Thus emerging are avariety of publication and presentation venues that are non-disciplinary. Theannual International Congress of Qualitative Inquiry organized by NormanDENZIN at the University of Illinois is illustrative; over two thousand re-searchers gather to present their work, much of it of a performative nature.Conference themes are generated around the idea that qualitative methodsshould serve social justice goals.2. Theoretical and Methodological PremisesDevelopments in performance inquiry have been primarily stimulated by theemergence of a social constructionist alternative to traditional empiricist viewof science. From the constructionist standpoint, one’s observations of the worldmake no principled demands on the forms of communication used to representthese observations. There are no words – or other symbolic forms of represen-tation – that are uniquely suited to account for whatever exists. From thisstandpoint, inquiry is invited into the limitations of traditional forms of socialscience writing (along with graphic and tabular representations of the world),and the potentials of alternative modes of expression. The use of performance2 <http://www.qualitative-research.net/index.php/fqs/issue/view/10>; see also Kip Jones,<http://kipworld.net/>.294as a form of communication in the social sciences is largely based on the fol-lowing proposals:- Traditional communication in the social sciences is highly specialized. The-ory and research findings are largely unintelligible to audiences untrainedwithin the disciplines. If a scientific text can easily be read by the generalpublic it is typically viewed as “unscientific,” and discounted by gatekeepersin a discipline. Thus, not only do social scientists largely suppress forms ofcommunication that might engage those who are the subject of study, buttheir work is generally ignored by those whose deliberations affect the fu-ture of the society.- By expanding the possibilities of representation – using theater, art, ormulti-media, for example – scientists invite a more fully embodied responsefrom their audiences; performances can more effectively motivate interestand action, and they can enhance dialogues on important societal issues.- All forms of description and explanation provide models for action. In thissense, written forms of social science communication are highly limited inwhat they offer as models for action. Essentially one exposed to a limitedrhetorical style. By expanding the range of communicative possibilities, sodo the sciences expand the repertoires for social action. Employing drama orfilm, for example, not only teaches about a given topic, but it also providesnew images for representation and action.- Traditional forms of representation in the sciences are realist in their rheto-ric. They suggest that the discourses in use are reflections (i.e. mirrors) ofexisting realities. By using performance as one’s mode of communication,these assumptions are undermined. The use of theater, fiction, poetry, or art,for example, suggests their aesthetic nature – that they are created by peopleand are not “mirrors of nature.” In this way, performative representations arecapable of conveying the sense of truth, but simultaneously undermining itsgrounds. They are not declarations of what is the case, so much as invita-tions to “consider this way of seeing the world.” Challenged are the distinc-tions between science/art, serious/play, and truth/imagination.- Traditional forms of scientific writing radically truncate the potentials of thelanguage. Typically they rely on declarative prose. A performative orienta-tion invites the writer to explore the full potentials of the medium, including,for example, irony, metaphor, humor, and more. While traditional writingseeks to bring the full content into a logically coherent whole, a performa-tive orientation invites explorations into ambiguity, subtle nuance, and con-tradiction.- Traditional communication practices in the sciences suppress or disregardthe value investments and implications of the research in question. Theysustain the misleading presumption of value-free research. Performativemodes of communication typically make apparent the investments and im-plications of one’s work. They often rely on dramatic tension to carry their295message, demonstrating that the scientist deeply cares about an issue andwishes to share these concerns with others.- When used in academic settings – for example, the lecture hall or profes-sional journal – performatively orientated work challenges the traditions thathave defined these locations as “truth zones,” that is locations honoring theexpression of those who possess the truth. The sciences thus become moreopened for the inclusion of multiple traditions, and thus they become morepolyvocal, dialogic, and democratic.- Performative social science allows for close collaborations among variousdisciplinary fields, from the humanities and the arts, as well as the other sci-ences (Jones, 2006).3. Current Conditions and Future PotentialsAlthough drawing from a rich history, the performative social sciences are in afledgling state of development. At the same time, the number of journals fea-turing qualitative research has rapidly expanded; see for example, The Journalof Qualitative Inquiry, Qualitative Research in Psychology, Text and Perform-ance Quarterly, International Review of Qualitative Research, and the on-linejournals, FQS, International Journal of Qualitative Methods, Qualitative Soci-ology Review, and The Qualitative Report. All these journals discuss or featureexperimental writing, poetry, visual images, dramatic scripts, and other formsof performative expression. Further, the Centre for Qualitative Research at theSchool of Health and Social Care at Bournemouth University, UK, offersgraduate study with a performance component. Also a listserv related to per-formative social science is available through a Sage Publications website.Both the enthusiasm for performative work and its contribution to social sci-ence deliberations are substantial. There is also ample reason for optimism interms of the future of such efforts. This is not only the case in terms of thepresent burgeoning of qualitative research across the social sciences, but aswell in terms of the opportunity that such research represents for the fledglingscholar. Performative inquiry, as we have seen, invites the scholar to engagewith issues that have significant personal value. Thus, rather than being forcedby the profession to join dialogues the parameters of which are already fixed,the performative domain invites the scholar into passionate inquiry. Further, thedomain invites scholars to use communicative skills (e.g., in music, art, theater,dance) that have otherwise been excluded from their professional life.This is not to say that the future of such work is unproblematic. Of all thedevelopments in qualitative inquiry, performative practices are the most radi-cal. This is so because, unlike most qualitative practices, they challenge theidentity of the discipline. By blurring the boundary between science and art,fact and fiction, seriousness and play, they challenge “normal science” activi-ties and standards. And, within the domain of the performative there remain296important questions. Three of these are prominent. First, there are difficulties injudging the quality or merit of performatively oriented work. Traditional stan-dards for evaluating research (e.g., validity and reliability, statistical sophistica-tion) are not applicable, and new and more ambiguous criteria must be consid-ered. Standards, such as cultural significance, communicative power, andaesthetic value, for example, are all subject to debate. To illustrate this chal-lenge, a recent PhD dissertation from the University of Bournemouth (ZoëFitzgerald Poole, 2008) was encased in a wooden box, inscribed with a brassnameplate, in which were placed two books, each page illustrated in colorfulgraphics, denoting the outcomes of interviews, synthesized by the author, into apoetic form. Also included in the box were DVDs with visual and auditoryexpositions of the interview materials. As appreciative gifts to the readers, thebox contained music, a mermaid figurine, a large doll representing a stuffy old-fashioned professor, chocolates, and hundreds of tiny wrapped up scrolls eachwith a saying inscribed with elegant calligraphy. There was a map to describehow to take in this collection, which had all been organized into small woodensections of the box. The dissertation oral, itself, proved to be somewhat contro-versial as questions arose about the scientific merits of the research process andthe representations of the results.The second issue is that of the accumulation of knowledge and the progressof the discipline. Traditional social science prized itself on these capacities.Performative approaches are less committed to these goals, but more investedin the meaningfulness of the research, and the ethical issues related to the re-search process itself (Keen & Tordes, 2007). In the case of performative in-quiry, there may be accumulation in terms of communicative efficacy, but aninvestment in increments in knowledge and disciplinary progress is typicallyreplaced by a concern with making an immediate impact of cultural signifi-cance. Performatively oriented scholars note that because patterns of social lifeare continuously transforming, the emphasis on accumulation is misleading.The social sciences acquire their significance not from attempting to predict thefuture from observations of the past, but from entering into those deliberationsthat create the future.ReferencesArnheim, Rudolf. 1969.
