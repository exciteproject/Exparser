Methods: The under study society includes allmale and female high school teacher in Ghorveh city in the academic year 2012-2013. Using simplerandom sampling method, a sample size of 100 male and female teachers was selected. To collect data,Kobassa Psychological Hardiness Questionnaire and Aghabeigi Workaholics Questionnaire wereemployed. To analyze the data, descriptive statistics (frequency, percentage, mean and standarddeviation) and inferential statistics (t-test and regression analysis) were used. Results: The findingsindicated that there is negative and significant relationship between the variables psychologicalhardiness and work holism. In addition, there is association between gender and psychological hardinessand between gender and work holism, also the constituents of psychological hardiness (commitment,control and challenge) are able to predict work holism.Keywords: psychological hardiness; work holism; gender1. INTRODUCTIONPsychological hardiness is one of the elements which play a basic role in man’s lifequality and to create a balance among different dimensions of it .People who have low hardinesswill hurt more by harmful elements in long term while people with high hardiness apparentlyhave natural or acquirable security against the stressfulelements. Hardiness is the ability tounderstand the external conditions accurately and to make a desirable decision about oneself(Jomhari, 2002). Kobasa (1979) introduce the hardiness as a complicated personal characteristicwhich is formed by three constituents: challenge, control and commitment which are supposedas a set acting as mediators to mediate stress effect as the recognition situation are changingand the stressful facts of life are decreasing (Sabri and Abdkhodai, 2010). Hardiness is mainlyrelates to the adjustment and positive agreement encountering problems and difficulties(Issacson, 2002). Researchers believe that hardiness and vulnerability are two opposite poles ofa same continuum (Fergus and Zemmerman 2005). Other researchers studied common featuresin people with hardiness includes: higher self-ruling, independency, sympathy, jobcommitment, endeavor, good problem, solving skills and good relationship with colleaguesThis is an open access article under the CC-BY 4.0 license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)2Volume 5(Issacson, 2002). Kobasa and Maddi (1982) state that people are very resistant to the mentalpressure and under the stressful situations not only don’t hurt mentally but also they welcomethem and believe that these situations are necessary for their development in life. Moreover,their studies about companies and graduated students showed that people who have a hardenpersonalities will experience less mental pressure and they will not be threat by mental pressure(Kobasa and Maddi 1982). Researchers indicated that hardiness has a positive relationshipwithphysical and mental disorder (Brooks 2003). Considering hardiness as a acquirable feature notmainly an inherent one (lambert 2007). Learning hardiness increase commitment, control andchallenge rates, the effects of each separately or in combination can decrease the rate ofrecognized stress (Nasiri, 2010). Kobasa (1979) believes that it can enforce person ability tocontrol situation ,to commit duties and to encounter events .Various studies have shown thathardiness has a positive relationship with people mental health (Maddi and khoshaba, 1994) ,itdecrease stress (Shapperand ;Kashani 1999) and that hardiness has a positive relationship withpeople physical and mental health (Florian et al 1995).The results of king et al; (1998) showed that people with hardiness evaluate unpleasantsituations in a challenging manner than threatening one and have more commitment tothemselves and their works and experience more sense of control in their lives. Kobasa (1979)has integrated three attributes:commitment, control and challenge all of which have originatedfrom the existing philosophy. She has described hardiness as a shield against diseases (Jomhari,2002).This is one of the main aspects of the personal control “personal efficiency”. This concepthas been presented by Albert Bandura (1997), people who have this characteristic believe thatthey can do everything successfully (Majidian, 2004). The challenging people serve lifechanges as challenges or opportunities to development not as limitations or threats (Kobasa1979). In addition, people with hardiness undergo less physical erosion in stressful conditions(Majidian, 2004). Work holism forms a great deal of man’s life as well as work engages peoplein itself both physically and cognitively. However, the business turbulent world exertsnumerous pressures on the business owners. Today organizations are dwindling in size andrebuilding that increase expectations and working demands and also it increase working hours(Schaufeli; et al; 2009).The term work holism has been presented first by Oates; 1971. Hedescribed this term as an uncontrollable need or obligation and driven to work continuously.This definition involves two constituents:extreme work, extreme tendency; to spend moretime to work than what the organization expects them to achieve its goals. The later indicatesthat work holists always and permanently think about work, even when they are not at work. Inother word, work holist’s mind usually engage in affaires relateto the work. These twocompartments as the behavioral and cognitive elements of work holism point to the root of thework holism that is just consistent with the alcoholism (Oates 1971). One of the job conceptsthat have been presented in academic and organizational environments since 1970s is “workholism”. Some researchers equalize work holism with other types of addiction and draw it withunhappy, sad or sensitive forms that person cannot do his work best and cause some problemsto his colleagues too (Agha Beigi 2007). It is believed that work holists do work more than whatis expected and do more efforts in a way that ignore their lives out of their job. Therefore itshould be mentioned that the most evident feature of work holists is that they work more thanwhat is necessary ( Buelens and Palman 2004). In general, work holism is defined as spendinga considerable amount of time to work; that is continuous cognitive engagement along withpreferring work during leisure time. (snir and Zohar 2008). To differentiate overworking resultsfrom correct planning and enough energy, theirdiscrepancies can be considered People whooverwork do work as an essential thing and sometimes interpret it as a satisfying duty but workInternational Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 53holists consider their work as a secure shelter by which they can avoid the unwantedcommitments and feelings out of the work.They know how and when attend home beside their families and friends completely andparticipate in its programs, work holists allow their work to have the maximum degree ofimportance in their lives. They often make commitments because of their work necessities, alsopeople who over work can lose their enthusiasm to work but work holists cannot. Their mindsengage in work even when they are at the exercising or recreational activities. These peopleengage their minds in working problems (Ahmadi et al 2010). Work holism is an unsatisfyingkind of need to work during which the following indications are remarkable: like other addictsthese people underestimate their working hours and ignore the overall time that they engagethemselves in problems relate to the work at home or weekends.These people ignore their spouse and children needs and serve their complaints as seekingexcuse or demanding. Depression: Totally, these people don’t feel excitement and liveliness.Reality distortion: In many cases, these patients are actually unaware of what they are doingand think that their unreasonable reactions are reasonable. Reduced self-confidence: Despiteremarkable economic successes, these people apparently are powerful and self-confined butmentally they are unstable and weak which is need to control. This is another defending reactionof these people who want to satisfy their absence with excuse seeking when they are attendant.As a satisfactory reaction they are oversensitive to what has happened at home during theirabsences. Unfortunately, they analyze problems pessimistically (Snir and Harpaz 2006). Scottet al; (1997) also identified three models of workholism include: radical drive (scrupulous),perfectionism and prosperous. In their opinion work holists have a high degree of scruple, stressand anxiety.Their work cause physical and mental problems, they have little satisfaction of their joband lives and their job performance are low. Perfectionist work holists have high level of stressand physical or mental problems, they have hostile and inefficient interrelationships, they havemore arbitrary absence and also they have lower job satisfaction and performance. Finally,prosperous work holists have lower life and job satisfaction, physical and mental health, jobperformance and high organizational citizenship behaviors and lower stress and arbitraryservice absence. Regarding the typology of work holism by Spence and Robins (1992) workholism is characterized based on the amount of these three constituents: Feeling of being drivento work, work involvement and work enjoyment. In work holists the rate of feeling of beingdriven to work is high, they have very high tendency to work but they don’t enjoy it. In contrast,people who are keen to work will engage in it while they feel enjoyment and don’t have anextreme drive. Moreover, they found that work holists experience higher job stress than others.Work holism can have different effects on people psychological and physical health and theirrelatives. The most common consequences of the work holism is to create a high level of jobstress and family-work contradiction; Although the following cases can be mentioned: Increasehealth threatening indications, job elimination, problems in group working, avoid familyrelationships, communication problems, low life satisfaction, lack of leisure time enjoyment(Piotrowski and Vodanovich, 2008). However, there have been a few internal and externalresearches in this area and the author points to some researches in which two concepts ofhardiness and addiction are presented as it was specified that work holism itself is a subconceptof addiction in its general form.Snir and Harpaz (2006) suggested that the probability of menworks holism is more than women. Mohammad talebi (2008) in has study show the relationshipbetween the organizational culture and work holism, Asgari, Mostafa (2002) has studied therelationship between hardiness and attachment style with the preparation for addiction that heobtained a negative and significant correlation between the hardiness and attachment with4Volume 5tendency to addiction. Kobasa et al (1982) state that people with hardiness had higher level ofjob satisfaction, low pressure at work environment and high quality of life compared to thepeople with low hardiness. Also,the rate of hardiness in men is more than women. Jomhari(2002) has examined the relationship between hardiness and tendency to depression and anxietyamong male and female students from Tehran University.Results showed that there is a reverse relationship between hardiness and tendency todepression and anxiety. Rash et al (1995) in his study showed that hardiness has a negativerelationship with mental stress at work and it has a positive relationship with job satisfaction(Izakian, 2001). Maddi et al (1996) in his research showed that hardiness has a negativecorrelation with drug addiction, alcohol in the past and present. Ahadi et al, (2008) in hisresearch studied the rate of hardiness in medical specialized assistances concluded that there isa positive correlation between hardiness and marriage and the mean score of hardiness inmarried people was 65/1 ± 10/93 and in unmarried ones it was 61/8 ± 11/31 . In this researchhe found that there is a significant difference between male and females such that the mean andthe standard deviation from the male and female hardiness score was (11/15, 64/7), (10/86,62/2) respectively. The objective of this research is to investigate the relationship betweenhardiness with work holism high school teachers in the academic year of 2012 - 2013. The mainassumption of the research is to examine the significant relationship between hardiness and therate of the work holism.2. METHODOLOGYResearch plan: The present study is a descriptive research which is includes 250 (145male and 105 female) high school teachers of Ghorveh city working in the academic year of2010-2011. According to the Kukrun formulation 100 (50 male and 50 female) was selected asthe sample size using simple random method. Among male teachers 28 teachers or 56 % weremarried and 22 ones or 44 % were unmarried and among females 30 % were unmarried and 70% were married. We send them questionnaires as below:The work holism measurement questionnaire: Work holism rate questionnaire had beenpresented by Agha Beigi (2007) and includes 30 questions. It uses Likert scale to the test scoring(1 = never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, 4 = always). It contains the most important constituentsof work holism. To measure the work holism questionnaire reliability in Agha Beigi research84 % was obtained via Kronbakh Alfa, also the test has been confirmed by masters and itsconvergence simultaneously with A type of behavior questionnaire which has given 61 %correlation coefficient that shows the test reliability.Kobasa‘s (1988) third generation of hardiness questionnaire: It contains 50 questionsincludes 17 questions about challenge, 16 questions about commitment and 17 questions aboutcontrol that have been formed based on the Likert scale (4 options) which had an amplituderange from zero ( incorrect) to 3 ( correct). The scores of 39 acts of the test are scored reverselyand to each three subscales scores are presented separately and the non-weighted mean of thesethree subscales are accounted for the total score of the hardiness. Kobasa’shardiness test hasbeen translated by Ghorbani (1995) and an acceptable content has been reported to it. Hardinessconstituents as control, commitment and challenge have a reliability coefficient of 7 %, 78 %72 % respectively and the reliability for total hardiness was 15 % ( Besharat, 2007).International Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 55Table 1.

It also concluded that there is a negativerelationship between hardiness and work holism that is the more the hardiness, the lower theirwork holism. So the research assumption is confirmed and zero assumption is rejected.Table 3.

That is the mean scores of hardiness among maleteachers are higher than females. Also the obtained scores show a difference between male andfemale teacher’s work holism, it means that in work holism difference variable, the male meanscores are higher than females.Table 5.

DISCUSSIONFindings indicated that there is a negative and significant relationship between hardinessand work holism and the higher the hardiness, the lower the work holism and vice versa.These results showed that people with hardiness are very resistant to the mental stress andthey don’t hurt mentally under the influence of the stressful situations (Kobasa and Madi; 1982).This research showed that hardiness has a negative correlation with drug and alcohol addictionwhether in the past or present. In addition, this research results are consistent with the resultsfrom Brooks (2003) and Florian et al (1995) study about the positive relationship betweenhardiness and physical or mental health. Shaparandand Kashani (1999); Rash et al (1995) andMajidian (2004) about the negative relationship between hardiness and stress; King et al (1998)believes that people with hardiness evaluate the unsatisfying situations in a challenging mannernot threateningly and they have more commitment about themselves and their work, also theyexperience more sense of control in their lives.The results confirmed the previous findings by researchers such as Spence and Robins(1992), Asgari (2002), Jomhari (2002), Scott et al (1997) and Pitroswki – Vodanovich (2008).Therefore to validate this relationship, it can be point to the mediating role of hardiness inmental stress effects to create physical and mental disorders. Today, mental stress is served asInternational Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 57a revealing indicator in mental disorders. It also has a significant role in some mental disorderssuch as anxiety. Other researches show that people with high rate of hardiness encounterstressful situations more effectively, for example by processing problems or convertingsituations to the positive ones. Moreover, these people are less involve in physical erosion instressful conditions (Majidian, 2004). Of the other results was the hardiness difference amongmales and females, so that the rate of hardiness in males was more than females, Which isconsistent with the findings of Ahadi et al (2008), Kobasa et al (1982).With respect to the fact that women have more talent to depression (twice the men),hardiness is a resistant shield against it (Sheppard, Kashani 1999). It can be pointed that menare more involve in the internal elements in life events, while women are more involve inexternal elements. In addition, there is a significant relationship between hardiness and marriagestatus, as the rate of hardiness is higher in married people, which is consistent with the findingsof Ahadi et al (2008).This is probably originated from the fact that married people have more responsibilitiescomparing with unmarried ones. Most of them believe that they are not mainly belonging tothemselves, but their families also are involved in their decisions and behaviors. It seems thatthey try to not serve the life events as boring and threatening and they usually try to make adynamic life based on the exalted goal for themselves and their families. One other result wasthe difference between male and female as the rate of work holism in females was more thanmales that is not consistent (Snir and Harpaz; 2006). To confirm this, some believe that menare more involve in the internal elements, while women are more involve in the externalelements of life events.The leading theory conclude that the work holists accept some effects that are alwaysenforcing, like admiration or criticism which cause to sustain behaviors relate to the workholism (Mc Milan et al 2003). One of the research limitations was the lack of a similar researchin this area and relates to the topic in Iran and abroad; also this topic was new as there had beenfound no similar research in scientific-searching databases, so there was not enoughbackground. One other limitation in the study was the use of usual samples (As they didn’tconsult to a consulting center and stated no complaint).Also it was assumed that the work holist’s performances on a continuum have manysimilarities in clinic and non-clinic populations. Anyway, the findings obtained from healthysamples should be considered remarkably to use this tool in other researches with clinic samples(they had consult to a center and stated a complaint). It is suggested that researchers examinethe relationship between hardiness and work holism in occupational, industrial and tradinggroups. Also it can be useful to study a questionnaire with populations of various ages(teenagers, middle-aged and old); some workshops can be made to teach hardiness and beingfamiliar with work holism to reduce work holism.4. CONCLUSIONThe institutions can be instructed to give consulting services or enough information toregulate work affairs to the extent that doesn’t eliminate some of the life important activities.The results from this study have many applications in initial screening of the applicants inconsulting pre-stages, especially to treat social, family and personal problems in clinical andresearching environment.8Volume 5AcknowledgmentReferencesResearchers bound themselves to thanks all the directors and colleagues from GhorvehHigh Schools and male and females who responded to the questionnaires.[1] <ref>Besharat M.
