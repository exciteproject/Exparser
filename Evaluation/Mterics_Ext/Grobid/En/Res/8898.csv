In this paper John Harley WARNER's research regarding use of the terms "natural" and"normal" in case notes in the U.S., as representative of the growing influence of laboratory sciencein the hospital, is compared to use of these words at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, and Adden-brooke's Hospital, Cambridge, England. Discourse at Bart's appears to support the view of eliteopposition to the laboratory. However, the case notes reveal that the bacteriological laboratory wasused at least as often as at Addenbrooke's. This apparent contradiction is investigated by examin-ing how the words "natural" and "normal" were used, and the reception of experimental physiologyat the hospitals. Samuel GEE, a physician at Bart's in the late nineteenth century, who also, at firstglance, had contradictory views on the use of the laboratory in the hospital, is examined through hispractice and writings in order to understand that representations of reception of laboratory scienceare not straightforward. Analysing changes in language over time shows that rhetoric and practiceare not always aligned, and that language cannot always be seen as an indicator of the latter.Table of Contents1.

Science and Standardisation: Exploring the Mindset of the Gentlemen Physicians6. Experimental Physiology and Bacteriology—The Laboratory and Clinical PracticeElite London physicians have presented themselves as both opposed to laboratoryscience and specialisation, and as embracing these new developments in the ageof the rise of laboratory biomedical sciences. Current historiography hasconcentrated on the former representation of these elite physicians, portrayingthem as considering medicine an art rather than a science. This case hasespecially been put forward for the physicians at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in© 2007 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung / Forum: Qualitative Social Research (ISSN 1438-5627)<ref><ref>FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920</ref></ref>London1. An analysis of discourse in the case notes from Bart's between 1880and 1920 appears to confirm the idea that physicians were reluctant to fullysupport the changes in ideology that experimental laboratory science brought tomedicine. This is especially highlighted when Bart's is compared toAddenbrooke's Hospital, at the time the unofficial teaching hospital for theUniversity of Cambridge, and to hospitals in the United States of America.However, the idea that elite physicians were not opposed to the laboratory hasrecently been raised regarding the practice of elite physicians who usedcommercial bacteriological laboratories, as only elite practitioners with wealthypatients could have afforded the prices charged by these institutions(WORBOYS, 2004). Looking at medical practice at Bart's confirms this view, andshows that the elite physicians who worked there welcomed the new science ofbacteriology. [1]The understanding of discourse in this paper is informed by work on the U.S..One of the major findings in John Harley WARNER's (1997a) pioneering study ofpatient records is the change of language from "natural" to "normal" over time. Heshows, with examples of two U.S. hospitals, that the use of the word "natural" todescribe a state of well-being had been "almost completely replaced" by "normal"by the mid-1870s. "Natural" related to an individual's well-being, which could differwith the seasons, or with ethnicity, location or sex, for example (WARNER,1997a, pp.85-86). The term "natural" refers to disease as non-specific, and as"systemic imbalances in the body's natural harmony" (WARNER, 1997a, p.86)2."Normal" is a word from experimental physiology which belongs to the secondhalf of the nineteenth century, when "universalized norms defined by laboratoryscience" became the way to consider well-being (WARNER, 1997a, pp.86-87).This is reflected in the graphical and quantitative representation of temperature,pulse, respiration and urinalysis—matching measurements to "normal standards"(WARNER, 1997a, p.87). Machines used in experimental physiology such as thekymograph recorded graphical images of the pulse or the respiration of ananimal, and this recording of information in a graphical form took off in clinicalmedicine. [2]1 The physicians of Bart's are particularly well represented in Christopher LAWRENCE's (1985)first article as advocates of character being highly important for the practice of medicine,including Patrick BLACK, Dyce DUCKWORTH and Sir James PAGET; a high prominence forThomas HORDER in his second article on the subject, alongside Samuel GEE, Sir PercivalHORTON-SMITH-HARLEY, and Sir Walter LANGDON BROWN (LAWRENCE, 1998); the 1999article being entirely focused on the Bart's physicians GEE, HORDER, and BROWN (LAWRENCE,1999); and the chapter of 2000 once again looking at GEE, HORDER, BROWN, the surgeon,D'Arcy POWER, and even William HARVEY, amongst other examples from the London andOxford elites (LAWRENCE, 2000). In LAWRENCE's (1985, pp.516-17) first article on this topic,though, Thomas Lauder BRUNTON is portrayed as an advocate of diagnostic technologiessuch as the sphygmograph and sphygmomanometer, and fan of continental science, withoutmentioning he was a Bart's physician. Tensions between the laboratory and elite physicians inthe clinic have also been examined for other countries (MAULITZ, 1979; GEISON, 1979;JACYNA, 1988).2 I use the word "specificity" with the opposite meaning to WARNER. He uses "specificity" and"universalism" to mean opposite ways of understanding disease. "Specificity" means"individualism" for him—the specificity of the patient—whereas in my research this term is usedwith reference to specific diseases (WARNER, 1997b).© 2007 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920The main sources for this study are clinical case notes from Bart's andAddenbrooke's Hospitals in order to compare use of language with use ofbacteriological methods of diagnosis. As a sampling method, all of the existingcase notes for pulmonary tuberculosis, typhoid fever and diphtheria have beenexamined from the years between 1880 and 19203. This paper challenges theexisting secondary literature in the field of history by using sources depicting whatactually happened, written at the time of these everyday events. Discourse canhelp to reveal the mindset of the physicians, and whether they were ready for theappropriation of laboratory science, and how much they believed in the worth of itstechniques and products. [3]There will be slightly more focus on Bart's in this paper, as this is the hospitalwhich shall be shown to not fit with the pattern of the clear transition through timefrom the use of the word "natural" to the word "normal". In order to examine thedifferences between the hospitals I shall first examine how Bart's andAddenbrooke's have been represented by historians. The creation of case notesat each hospital shall be considered, and then the use of language at both of theEnglish hospitals will be compared with use of language in the U.S. Differenceswill be considered in light of the use of laboratory sciences at the two Englishhospitals, and the "double lives" which Bart's physicians appeared to lead,focusing on Samuel GEE as an example of the latter. [4]Although being linked by the theme "Time and Discourse" to the other papers inthis volume, this contribution is different in that it looks at change in discourseover a long time period of forty years. Also, it looks at the late nineteenth andearly twentieth centuries whereas the other papers examine contemporary eventsor the very recent past. However, MOREIRA and especially MOTZKAU, groundtheir work historically. The paper also differs from almost all of the others byexamining the use of particular words to examine changing concepts, rather thana wider framework of discourse. The use of these words is, however, analysed toexamine the more general change in ideology regarding the use of laboratoryscience in medicine. There are similarities to ELGAARD JENSEN's paper, whichlooks at a single word in examining the construction of the "future" in discourse ina study of representation of a new kind of office space, analysing how this word isused to persuade "witnesses" and how it is then replicated. The identity of thecompany is constructed through this word, and in this paper on the history ofmedicine, words are also seen to illustrate a changing identity of physicians overtime. Although this paper considers the discourse of a hundred years ago, one ofthe main sources for this work overlaps with that used by other studies in thisvolume which partly focus on documents and their creation to empirically examinetime and discourse, such as those by KONTOPODIS and ELGAARD JENSEN.3 This sample of bacterial disease was chosen for wider research on the use of bacteriology inthe Ph.D. thesis from which this paper is derived, "Using bacteriology in the hospital and insociety: England, 1880-1939", Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine,University of London, forthcoming 2007.

[5]2. St. Bartholomew's Hospital—An Elite London InstitutionSt. Bartholomew's Hospital is the oldest continually open hospital in Britain, andperhaps was the most prestigious in the country between 1880 and 1920.Historian of medicine, Christopher LAWRENCE, focuses on the physicians at thishospital, especially in his article on the interwar years (LAWRENCE, 1998), givingthe impression that at this hospital the physicians would not have routinely used adiagnostic laboratory with specialist pathologists diagnosing patients away fromthe bedside (LAWRENCE, 1985; 1998; 1999; 2000). [6]Roy PORTER, Jeanne PETERSON and Christopher LAWRENCE have allexamined how London hospital physicians differed from those in the rest of thecountry, except perhaps Oxford. Roy PORTER (2001, p.255) describes London'selite physicians of the nineteenth century as having "plush positions of professionalauthority and eminence." One of Christopher LAWRENCE's (1985; 1998) mainthemes in his articles on the London medical profession and their clinical practicefrom 1850-1939, is the idea of gentility amongst the elite. He attributes thismentality to the "distinguished lay governors" who selected physicians by "classattributes rather than medical skill"; the importance of "character more than thepursuit of expertise" (LAWRENCE, 1985, pp.503-504). Elite London physiciansalso controlled the professional institutions, holding the highest offices of theRoyal College of Physicians and Surgeons (PETERSON, 1978, p.137). JeannePETERSON (1978, p.136) perhaps best sums up the status of these physicians:"Those who practiced in London hospitals and in private practice were rewarded withhigh social connections, prosperity if not wealth, and … [the] pleasures of the upperranks of Victorian society. Knighthoods or baronetcies, country houses, lavishentertaining, foreign travel, Alpine mountain-climbing, membership at the Athenaeum,art collecting—all were possible for the select few who were numbered among theLondon medical and surgical elite. They often married well, sent their sons to publicschool and university; they owned carriages, hired servants, and donned the morningcoats and top hats that daily bespoke their elevated status." [7]In the 1960s, the London teaching hospitals were "still the seats of power", in thewords of commentator Paul FERRIS (1965, pp.61-62), especially St.Bartholomew's Hospital and St. Thomas's Hospital, which had the "best socialstanding and the nicest upper-class nurses." [8]Despite the eminence of the London teaching hospitals, they have not been seenas the most progressive of hospitals in their use of scientific knowledge andmedical technology by some historians and commentators. According toLAWRENCE (1985, p.507), for gentlemen physicians clinical medicine was"based on science" but was an "art which necessitated that its practitioners be themost cultured of men and the most experienced reflectors on the human© 2007 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920condition." He examines the delayed use of medical instruments such as thesphygmograph and sphygmomanometer, as described in published medicalliterature (LAWRENCE, 1985, pp.515-516). The gentlemen physicians of theinterwar years were apparently "anti-mechanization and standardization" due totheir holistic worldview (LAWRENCE, 1998, p.94). The London teaching hospitalsof the 1960s were still "stiff with protocol, old-fashioned and due to lose their gripon the central mysteries of medicine" (FERRIS, 1965, p.62). FERRIS (1965,p.64) wrote:"Medicine as a whole is becoming so complex that the individual performer will soonseem an archaic figure, mumbling the magic formula, 'bedside medicine,' obsessedwith the gentlemanliness of his profession. But the London system is still rooted inthis archaic individualism of the part-time gentleman." [9]LAWRENCE (1998, p.95) considers that the interwar gentlemen physiciansapproved of the laboratory for diagnostic and experimental purposes but "weredetermined to integrate it into their preferred social order"—an order whichopposed specialisation. Apparently, physicians like St. Bartholomew's ThomasHORDER believed that all clinical pathology should be carried out by the clinicianhimself, and Sir Walter LANGDON-BROWN worried about the division of labourin society in general (LAWRENCE, 1998, pp.98 and 105). Joel D. HOWELL(1987, p.58), who has examined the use of technology in the hospital in the U.S.,considers that in the early twentieth century, British physicians as a whole did notaccept "[t]he bacteriologist and his gram stains; the physiologist and hiskymograph" as part of "normal" clinical medicine, and that these techniques werefor "training purposes in an academic setting." Apparently specialisation inmedicine was also not accepted throughout the country (HOWELL, 1987, p.59).This appears to be the current prevailing view in the secondary literature, andpartly so in the physicians' published primary literature. [10]3. Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge—Unofficial Teaching Hospitalto a Medieval UniversityAt the beginning of the period of this study, the University of Cambridge'sdepartment of Medicine was developing a reputation to rival the London medicalschools. The status of the school had been very low in the early nineteenthcentury. From 1833 to 1858 an average of less than four students per yearstudied Medicine at the University, and the qualification obtained was not highlyregarded within the medical profession (ROOK, CARLTON & CANNON, 1991,pp.118-119). Medical journals compared Cambridge unfavourably with theLondon medical schools with regard to size of hospitals and lack of dissectingrooms (WEATHERALL, 2000, p.15). However, bedside clinical instruction hadbeen given to Cambridge medical students from 1819 (WEATHERALL, 2000,p.63). By the late nineteenth century the reputation of the school had changedwith 70 students joining the medical course in 1880 (WEATHERALL, 2000,p.110) and Cambridge having one of the largest medical schools in the countryby 1891. At this time the degree was regarded as "one of the highest professionalqualifications" (ROOK et al., 1991, pp.118-119). However, Addenbrooke's© 2007 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920Hospital continued to be too small to cope with all the medical students for theirwhole degree, so London hospitals, amongst others, were used for studentplacements during the late nineteenth century (WEATHERALL, 2000, p.131).According to WEATHERALL (2000, p.116), the aim of the Cambridge medicalschool was to attract physicians who had "clinical ability and scientific curiosity"—people like John BRADBURY who was Physician to Addenbrooke's for fifty yearsand who also published on pathological and clinical subjects in the BMJ and theLancet. Cambridge is also an interesting case to study in comparison to Bart's, asGerald GEISON (1978, pp.9, 81 and 96) considers that Cambridge was auniversity in transition from the 1870s. University professors were taking theirjobs more seriously, considering an academic career could be for life, and bothtransmitting and producing knowledge. He demonstrates this changingenvironment by linking the growth of Michael FOSTER's physiological school withthat of the rise of the Cavendish Laboratory for physics. He considers that withoutthis change at Cambridge, English physiology would have been very different(GEISON, 1978, p.47). In suggesting that biology in Cambridge would have beentransformed by George HUMPHRY, the surgeon, if FOSTER had not come toCambridge, GEISON (1978, p.123) shows that he considers that the town anduniversity were perhaps more important than the person. Therefore, the generalmilieu in Cambridge in the late nineteenth century with regard to laboratoryscience is very important to consider when examining changing discourse andpractice. [11]The connection between the University of Cambridge and Addenbrooke'sHospital appeared assured as, from 1785, it had been the tradition that aphysician at Addenbrooke's Hospital was appointed the Regius Professor ofPhysic at Cambridge (ROOK et al., 1991, p.238)4. Other physicians at thehospital included Downing Professors of Medicine, Fellows of various collegesand one Lucasian Professor of Mathematics (ROOK et al., pp.60, 61, 83, 85,101). However, when Clifford ALLBUTT (a supporter of the value of experimentalscience for the practice of medicine) was appointed as the Regius Professor in1892, this relationship came into question. Clifford ALLBUTT was, according toSir Walter LANGDON-BROWN, appointed as it was too hard to choose betweenthe three physicians at Addenbrooke's (ROOK et al., 1991, p.238)5. ALLBUTTwas not to receive a position at the Hospital until 1900, although he did deputisefor Dr Donald MACALISTER in the summers of 1896-97 (ROOK et al., 1991,p.247). In 1895, the Vice Chancellor asked the Hospital for a conference toestablish "a closer and more regular connexion between the Hospital and theUniversity Teachers in the Department of Medicine." All members of staff at theHospital, except one, were also professors or teachers at the university, andclinical lectures were given in the wards, the Board Room, and the OperatingTheatre, but there was still no official link (ROOK et al., 1991, pp.238-239). In1896, it was agreed in the Committee that Lecturers could use the hospital, and4 The hospital was opened in 1766, with the Regius Professor of Physic, Russell PLUMPTRE, asa physician to Addenbrooke's (ROOK et al., 1991, p.58). So there must only have been a smallgap when the Regius Professor incumbent was not physician to the hospital.5 ROOK (1991, p.238) cites Sir W. LANGDON BROWN (1946).

In 1900, itwas agreed that the University would pay the hospital £300 per year, and theRegius Professor could be a Physician, with the Professor choosing whether hewould like beds to supervise, or whether he would only like them for teachingpurposes. ALLBUTT declined the offer of beds to supervise, telling the Hospitalhe already had enough for teaching purposes (ROOK et al., 1991, p.248). He didnot take over the care of any beds until staff shortages during the First WorldWar (ROOK et al., 1991, p.315). However, the links between the hospital and theuniversity were also practical in the nature of diagnosis of patients.Addenbrooke's' X-rays were initially carried out at the Cavendish Laboratory, bymembers of staff there—Mr. W.H. HAYLES and Mr. EVERETT—as early as1896. Indeed, Mr. HAYLES was, according to some Cambridge medicalhistorians, probably the "first man in England to take an X-ray" (ROOK et al.,1991, p.332). Addenbrooke's got its own machine in 1903, firstly with surgeonsunsuccessfully taking their own photographs, and subsequently in 1907 with Mr.FIELD, the dispenser, learning how to use it from staff at Bart's. This isinteresting considering the view discussed earlier of Bart's and technologicalinstruments (ROOK et al., 1991, p.332). The Hospital and University were alsoclosely connected in geographical terms. In the late nineteenth century,Addenbrooke's Hospital and the New Museums site, which began construction in1863, were closely situated in Cambridge (WEATHERALL, 2000, p.98). Thelocation of the Cavendish Laboratory on Free School Lane would have enabledclose interaction between Hospital and University.© 2007 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920Illustration 1: Map of Cambridge—Laboratories and Hospital Area (CAMBRIDGEPARLIAMENTARY AND MUNICIPAL BOROUGH, 1927) [12]The University also had political control over the Hospital even though an officialconnection was lacking. Scientists at the University of Cambridge gained moreimportance in decision- making in the latter quarter of the nineteenth century. In1878, George PAGET, Regius Professor of Physic, complained about the lack of© 2007 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920consultation in the proposed election of a professor for physiology at TrinityCollege and how this typified the importance given to natural sciences comparedto medicine (GEISON, 1978, p.108)6. In 1883-4, the scientists at the Universitywere officially given more power than the physicians who had positions at theUniversity. A university-wide decision was made to give more power in decision-making to residents of the University, as opposed to non-residents. This meantthat the Board of Medicine came to have a clear majority of pre-clinical scientists,and led to the first Professor of Pathology, Charles Smart ROY, being aphysiological pathologist, rather than a clinical pathologist (WEATHERALL, 2000,pp.133 and 139)7. The Lancet announced at the news of this appointment that itwould "blight the hopes of those who were looking forward to the establishment ofa practical medicine school at Cambridge" for ROY was really an experimentalphysiologist (WEATHERALL, 2000, p.143)8. GEISON (1978, pp.365-366)considers that FOSTER had a key part to play in the appointment of CliffordALLBUTT. This loss of control of Medicine in the University angered thephysicians at Addenbrooke's and perhaps contributed to the delay in ALLBUTTbeing accepted at the Hospital (WEATHERALL, 2000, p.189). [13]4. Life on the WardsFrom the clinical records at Bart's it is clear that the internal medicine case noteswere not actually completed by the physicians examined in this paper, but byclinical clerks. Their names always begin with "Mr." rather than "Dr." in theinternal medicine case notes. However, there are indicators that the physicianshad a heavy influence on the case notes. Geoffrey BOURNE (1963, pp.35 and123), a student and subsequently physician at Bart's, has written anautobiography which tells in detail the procedures followed. The "Clinical Clerks"mentioned in the case notes were medical students in the clinical years of theirdegree. Clerking involved taking histories and physical examinations. Physicianswere involved in this process though. BOURNE describes how John DRYSDALEled students to describe the condition of the patient through his "Socratic methodof careful questioning", and then led them through "examination, inspection,palpation, percussion and auscultation." These notes were read out to theconsultants and were criticised by them as to length, content, and style of writingand language (BOURNE, 1963, pp.36-37 and 78). [14]In a couple of instances in the casebooks, physicians' involvement is illustrated.For example, physicians signed requests for the pathologist to undertake aWidal's test (invented in 1896). This is in the same case book, in 1898, butsigned by two different doctors—CHURCH and MOORE (SBH 16/41/141;16/41/181). There are common characteristics in case notes supervised by the6 The professorship was not created at this time due to agricultural depression lowering TrinityCollege's income (GEISON, 1978, p.108).7 The vote was actually tied between ROY and the clinical pathologist, David James HAMILTON,but the Vice Chancellor of the University showed where his allegiance lay, voting for ROY(WEATHERALL, 2000, pp.139-140).8 WEATHERALL (2000, p.143) cites the Lancet (1884), 1, 911.© 2007 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920same clinician, such as this symbol which was only used in two case books ofDUCKWORTH's:Illustration 2: Symbol for Typhoid [15]The symbol was used frequently in 1893 (in five out of ten cases) and in 1897 (intwo out of four cases). The phrase "Typhoides Febris" was only used under thecare of Dr. TOOTH for all three cases examined on his ward in 1911 and 1913(SBH 16/39 and 16/43). This again shows the influence of physicians on theirclerks' notes, as it happened over three years. It seems, judging by handwriting,that Samuel GEE wrote part or all of 69 out of 90 sets of case notes between1882 and 18999. [16]The case notes for Addenbrooke's Hospital are not uniform like those at Bart's.Case notes from Bart's are almost always complete and include in order a frontsheet with the patient's personal details and a summary of the case and usually adiagnosis, the notes taken during the patient's stay, graphs documentingtemperature with accompanying charts with information about urinalysis, forexample, and a sheet detailing diet and treatments prescribed. Later, extra pagessuch as pathology and X-ray reports were included. These are not in specificplaces in the notes. Addenbrooke's case notes contain similar sources ofinformation, but on many occasions they are not all present. Addenbrooke's casenotes are signed by "House physicians" rather than "clinical clerks". It appearsthat either standards and expectations of completion of case notes were muchhigher at Bart's, or that students were more conscientious than junior doctorswhen completing case notes in order to impress their teachers and pass theirdegree. The influence which physicians had on students' notes at Bart's maymean they show a previous generation's views when compared to notes compiledby junior doctors at Addenbrooke's. [17]5. Science and Standardisation: Exploring the Mindset of theGentlemen PhysiciansWARNER shows the transition from "natural" to "normal" with his study of therecords of the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Commercial Hospital ofCincinnati. WARNER's (1997a, pp.104 and 113) sample of cases—about 4000—compared to the 405 cases examined at Bart's and 1418 at Addenbrooke's ismore significant for trends. However, there are noticeable differences which canbe seen between St. Bartholomew's Hospital and the two hospitals in the U.S..Illustration 3 shows the percentages of cases in which WARNER found these twowords at each hospital.Illustration 3: Percentage of case notes in which terms "natural" and "normal" appear, from9 Although this test is not very accurate, I have become very familiar with Samuel GEE'shandwriting from looking through his private casebooks which are discussed later in this paper. Ihave not attempted this kind of analysis for any other physician as I do not have enoughfamiliarity with their handwriting.© 2007 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920WARNER (1997a, p.88) [18]The change is significant with hardly any records using "natural" by the 1870sand 1880s at both hospitals.

The period represented by Illustration 4begins where WARNER's ends, but shows that "natural" was still commonly usedright up until 1920, with "normal" not even becoming predominant by the lastyears of the four decades shown.

WARNER considers that the use oflanguage in medical records reflects the change in "cognition" of the physicians.Although the sample is small compared to WARNER's, the word natural wasevidently very much in use at Bart's throughout the period 1880-1920, indicatingthat medical practice would, like language, not be affected as much as otherhospitals by new scientific knowledge produced in the laboratory. [21]At Addenbrooke's, as would be expected with the influences the hospital hadfrom the University of Cambridge, "normal" superseded "natural" from an earlystage, as shown in Illustrations 6 and 7.© 2007 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920Illustration 6: Percentage of the sample of case notes from Addenbrooke's Hospital whichuse the terms "natural" and "normal"Illustration 7: Percentage of the sample of case notes from Addenbrooke's Hospital inwhich "natural" and "normal" are used more than the other [22]"Natural" and "normal" were often written close together in case notes, even forthe same types of descriptions. For example, in an Addenbrooke's' case note it waswritten in 1902, "Cor. natural and in normal position" (AH 025/8-9/208). A Bart's'case note states in 1896, "Knee jerks nat." and then in the same handwriting thenext day, with only two lines in between, it was written, "Knee jerks normal" (SBH16/042/028). This could be used to question the change in use of "natural" and© 2007 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920"normal," especially for Bart's where both terms were used commonly until 1920.However, often the way in which both terms were used in the same case notewas when there was a reference to the temperature being normal. WARNER(1997a, pp.89-90) found in U.S. case notes that quantitative measurements weredescribed as "normal" before qualitative descriptions. This was especially thecase for evidence gained using instruments such as the "stethoscope,thermometer, or time-piece". [23]Illustration 8 shows the proportion of case notes in which temperature is referredto as either "natural" or "normal". As I have counted the total number of timeseach term is used in each case note, the result is sometimes above one hundredper cent—therefore this is a relative representation of the use of "natural" and"normal" using case notes as a base comparison number. It can clearly be seenthat temperature was nearly always referred to as "normal" at Bart's.Illustration 8: Percentage of the sample of case notes from St. Bartholomew's Hospital inwhich temperature is referred to as either "natural" or "normal" (case notes as basenumber to judge percentage) [24]At Addenbrooke's temperature was never referred to as "natural" in the samplecase notes. This use of the term "normal" for a quantitative measure correlateswith WARNER's study. However, Bart's does not follow the same pattern whenheart sounds are examined (Illustration 9):© 2007 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920Illustration 9: Percentage of the sample of case notes from St. Bartholomew's Hospital inwhich heart sounds are referred to as either "natural" or "normal" (case notes as base numberto judge percentage) [25]However, at Addenbrooke's doctors used predominantly "normal" to describeheart sounds, right from the beginning of the period, and exclusively so from1907. Therefore, the relationship between language and possibly quantitativemeasures at Bart's is not simple. However, surely temperature is easier toconsider as "normal" than heart sounds, as there was a set figure in the graphs inthe case notes determined as normal, with a printed line drawn across at thatpoint. [26]The way in which a qualitative, subjective description of organs or parts of thebody (such as shape, position, what was palpable) was made demonstrates thatBart's staff and students used "natural" for this type of assessment (Illustration 10):© 2007 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920Illustration 10: Percentage of the sample of case notes from St. Bartholomew's Hospital inwhich subjective descriptions of organs and parts of the body are referred to as either"natural" or "normal" (case notes as base number to judge percentage) [27]Addenbrooke's closely followed the American model even for this kind ofdescription (Illustration 11):Illustration 11: Percentage of the sample of case notes from Addenbrooke's Hospital inwhich subjective descriptions of organs and parts of the body are referred to as either"natural" or "normal" (case notes as base number to judge percentage) [28]© 2007 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920This analysis of the way in which "natural" and "normal" were used in general,and in particular contexts shows stark differences between the two hospitalsinvestigated. Therefore the rest of the paper examines how laboratory science wasperceived at the two hospitals in order to try to understand these differences. [29]6. Experimental Physiology and Bacteriology—The Laboratory andClinical PracticeWARNER (1997a, pp.5-6, 85-7) framed the change from "natural" to "normal" ascoinciding with the gradual growth of experimental physiology as a model sciencefor medicine. The use of therapeutics changed from acting on the body as awhole to restore the patient's individual "natural" balance, to working on specificparts of the body in line with knowledge gained from experimental physiology,with the aim of returning the body to universalised "measured, quantified norms"determined or influenced by the laboratory. The influence of experimentalphysiology may point to why changes in language were so different atAddenbrooke's than at Bart's. [30]Mid to late nineteenth century German experimental physiology is associated with"biophysics" and the use of instruments (and also chemistry), sometimesresulting in graphical representation such as the recording of the pulse by thekymograph and sphygmograph (CRANEFIELD, 1957, p.407; FRANK, 1988,pp.215-16). This influence can clearly be seen in the case notes of the twoEnglish hospitals, where it is unusual for there to not be a graph in each case fileshowing temperature in the period examined in this paper. Chemical assaying, ofurine for example, also showed the influence of chemical physiology. By the latenineteenth century, the University of Cambridge was arguably the "leading centerof physiological research in England, if not the world" (GEISON, 1978, pp.183-4).The style of experimental physiology was not perhaps as exacting as in Germany,with less emphasis on graphical representation, and more on the senses. In1874, however, FOSTER did receive money for recording apparatus for hislaboratory which GEISON (1978, p.106) speculates was a kymograph.GASKELL, one of Foster's protégés, spent a year working with LUDWIG in 1874,the man who chiefly created the kymograph, and other students from Cambridgespent time in German laboratories (GEISON, 1978, pp.180-3 and 253). GEISON(1978, pp.253-6) discusses GASKELL's work on vaso-motor action and itscontinuation on his return to Cambridge, comparing the "Leipzig method" with the"Cambridge method". In Leipzig, under LUDWIG, GASKELL had conductedexperiments using a larger dog, and the kymograph for measurement of bloodflow, whereas in Cambridge he used the smaller frog ("as if in imitation of hissmaller and less elaborate surroundings") and used the "Cambridge method" of amicrometer eyepiece for direct measurement of arterial diameters. GASKELL didlater use the kymograph in Cambridge, though, in an experiment on the heart of atortoise in 1883 (GEISON, 1978, p.295). However, the importance ofexperimental physiology in general and the numbers of students educated in itsmethods may have had an impact on the use of vocabulary at Addenbrooke'sHospital. Huge numbers of students studied elementary physiology, with anintake of 130 in 1885, and 190 in 1889 (GEISON, 1978, pp.306 and 308).© 2007 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920FOSTER, HUMPHRY, and ALLBUTT at Cambridge thought it was preferable tothe old system of students going straight from the mathematical tripos to clinicalstudies, for students to have training in pre-clinical natural sciences, withFOSTER thinking they should undertake the natural sciences tripos includingphysiology (GEISON, 1978, pp.365-6). [31]Practical physiology teaching in England began in the late 1860s, with FOSTER'selective course at University College London (GEISON, 1978, p.330). England ingeneral did not at all compete with German "biophysics". FOSTER rememberedhis mentor, William SHARPEY, at University College London, having to use acylinder hat to explain the kymograph in the 1850s (GEISON, 1978, p.56). In1870 the Royal College of Surgeons introduced a requirement that thirty classesof "practical" anatomy and physiology should be a requirement of the licentiate,with students themselves partaking in experiments, and the University of Londonadopted this requirement in 1871 (GEISON, 1978, pp.329). GEISON considersthis development led to the growth of physiology in Britain (GEISON, 1978,pp.150-1). The discipline of physiology in Britain as a whole expanded between1870 and 1900, at least arresting the flow of physiologists to the Continent(GEISON, 1978, p.150). [32]Keir WADDINGTON (2003, pp.125-6) has presented physiology at Bart's asbeing taught reluctantly10. However, many of the initial problems which physiologyfaced were also present in Cambridge, such as lack of space for students(GEISON, 1978, pp.171-2). Although Bart's did not have the reputation of theCambridge school of physiology, Thomas Lauder BRUNTON was veryenthusiastic about experimental pharmacology and physiology, publishing widely,and working on treatments which had practical applications such as the action ofdigitalis. Like contemporaries at Cambridge, he spent time at the UniversityCollege London laboratories, and in laboratories in Vienna, Berlin and atLUDWIG's laboratory in Leipzig in the early 1870s. However, rather thanspecialising in experimental physiology like GASKELL, he combined researchwith hospital medicine (WHITE FRANKLIN, 1974, pp.180-83; LAWRENCE, 1985,pp.516-17). Therefore, the impact of physiology at Bart's is not straightforwardand requires further investigation, but no doubt did not have the same influenceon medical practice as the famous laboratory at Cambridge. [33]Bacteriology, and its forerunners from the 1840s (ideas of "specific chemical,fungal, and animalcular causes of disease"), also had an effect on ideas ofuniversalised and specific disease causation (WARNER, 1997a, p.87). Examininguse of bacteriological laboratory techniques shows different pictures of thereception of experimental science at Bart's and Addenbrooke's. [34]Contrary to use of language, bacteriological methods can be shown to have beenaccepted slightly more enthusiastically at Bart's than at Addenbrooke's. Fortyphoid fever, the diagnostic Widal's test was discovered in 1896. This10 WADDINGTON (2003, p.131) also presents bacteriology as being negatively received at Bart'sin the 1880s and presents a picture of Samuel GEE being opposed to the use of the laboratory, soit is worth reconsidering his representation of the reception of experimental physiology at Bart's.© 2007 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920agglutination test was widely used from 1898 at Bart's, with it being documentedin all of the eight surviving case notes from 1898, and thereafter regularly used insurviving case files, only for one year in 1902 dropping below 60 per cent ofcases. The bacteriological test for pulmonary tuberculosis, of looking for tuberclebacilli in sputa, was not used as routinely as the test for typhoid, though it was stillused regularly. It was probably not used as often due to fairly effective existingmethods of percussion and auscultation. The most convincing of the samplediseases for illustrating routine use of the bacteriological laboratory at Bart's isdiphtheria. There was a slow acceptance of the bacteriological examination fordiphtheria (the bacillus was isolated in 1883) due to widely acknowledgedproblems with reliability and staining (HAMMONDS, 1999, pp.50-52;ANDREWES, 1928, p.116). However, by 1896 it was routine, with 72 out of 84surviving case notes showing patients received the test11. This evidence leads tothe question of whether discourse does show change in cognition and calls forfurther analysis of practice and rhetoric at Bart's. The following detailed study of aBart's physician may help to illuminate why discourse was so different frompractice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. [35]7. Double Lives?—Samuel GEEThe concept of "double lives" can be used as a device to try to understand whyphysicians' images were presented differently at different times, and why practicewas different to language at Bart's. Samuel GEE is an ideal character to use as acase study as his representation in the secondary literature, and in the extracts ofhis own writings used within this, shows him to be apparently leading acompletely different life to that shown by his medical practice on the wards atBart's. [36]Samuel GEE began his professional career at Bart's in 1870, becoming a fullphysician in 1878. He was Physician to the Prince of Wales from 1901. With hisHeadmasters' Conference school education at University College School, aLondon medical education, his interest in the history of medicine and a position inthe royal household, GEE was a gentleman physician in LAWRENCE andPETERSON's definitions (BROWN, 1955, pp.183-4). [37]GEE has been portrayed as an advocate of medicine as an art. Indeed,LAWRENCE (1998, p.96) quotes him as saying, "When you enter my wards yourfirst duty is to forget all your physiology. Physiology is an experimental science—and a very good thing no doubt in its proper place. Medicine is not a science, butan empirical art"12. [38]GEE "declined the honour of delivering the Harveian Oration at the Royal Collegeof Physicians due to his disapproval of HARVEY's injunction to 'search and studyout the secrets of nature by way of experiment'" (BODLEY SCOTT, 1974, p.185).11 The STATISTICAL REPORT (1896) shows that there were 92 cases of diphtheria admitted in1896, so this is a very indicative sample.12 LAWRENCE (1998, p.96) cites Henry DALE (1950). Scientific Method in Medical Research.British Medical Journal, 2, 1187.© 2007 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920As well as apparently being against laboratory science at the bedside (he was notopposed to physiology as a subject in its own right), he was quoted as beingopposed to specialisation, proclaiming, "There is a name that I hate, yea thereare two names that my soul abhoreth, the name of specialist and the name of aconsultant" (BODLEY SCOTT, 1974, p.186)13. [39]However, evidence from the clinical case notes from GEE's wards show that hispatients received diagnostic assistance from the laboratory, therefore usingexperimental science performed by a specialist. Pathology had becomespecialised from 1893, when a full-time lecturer in pathology was appointed wholay the foundations of the Pathology Department during his four years at Bart's(WADDINGTON, 2003, p.117). GEE's patients were diagnosed with Widal's testsin six out of seven surviving typhoid records in 1899 (these are his earliest andonly case files surviving after the discovery of the Widal's test). This shows anearly and convincing acceptance of the worth of Widal's testing in cases oftyphoid fever, which completely contradicts GEE's public image. For pulmonarytuberculosis and diphtheria, GEE's patients also increasingly receivedbacteriological laboratory tests from 1894-6. [40]GEE's private notebooks show his use and opinions of bacteriology. Thesenotebooks include notes from other authors, his own aphorisms, and alsoselected transcriptions of his case notes. In his extracts from case notes, it canalso be seen that GEE (MS36, pp.135-6, 305 and 306) used the bacteriologicallaboratory for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis between 1885 and 1891. [41]GEE did not keep his use of the bacteriological laboratory secret. As well ascarrying signs that GEE thought of medicine as an art, his Medical Lectures andAphorisms, which went through at least four editions, includes the followingexamples of his use of bacteriology: GEE (1915a, p.74) included in anassessment of a case of chronic pituitous catarrh, read in front of the RoyalCollege of Physicians, that "[t]ubercle Bacilli were not found." In discussing diag-nosis of Bronchitis and Pulmonary Tuberculosis in the same lecture he mentionedthe problems sometimes encountered using auscultation, but "since KOCH'sdiscovery of the tubercle bacillus we have a potent auxiliary to diagnosis in themicroscopic examination of the sputa" (GEE, 1915a, p.91). In his Aphorisms GEE(1915b, pp.244 and 266) said of cavernous bronchial breathing, that if it wascaused by "tuberculous disease … discovery of tubercle bacilli would confirm it",and again concerning phthisis, that amongst all the methods of diagnosis, themost important was, "above all, detection of tubercle bacilli in the sputa". He evenadvised his medical students to tell patients suspected of being "phthisical" to"[s]ave your sputa to be tested (for bacilli)" (GEE, 1915b, p.246). Concerningtyphoid accompanied by delirium, he considered that "testing the blood bycultivations of typhoid bacilli (Widal's test) must be employed as an additionalmeans of diagnosis" (GEE, 1915b, pp.290-291). He also said, comparing himselfwith the empirical physician, in front of the Abernethian Society at Bart's in 1889, "Iam ready to accept help from any source, from physiology and pharmacology, but13 See a similar comment in his private notebook (GEE, MS36, p.345).© 2007 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920also from mechanics, optics and similar sciences, from bacteriology, electricityand chemistry, nay very gratefully from cookery, upholstery, ironmongery, andindeed from any source" (GEE 1915c, p.238). [42]He wrote a very similar comment privately, showing his conviction about the worthof other disciplines (GEE, MS34, pp.123-4). In discussing the process of thelungs becoming emphysematous, in a lecture to the Royal College of Physicians,he complained "unfortunately we can get no help from experimental pathology" inthe same manner as it could be used for inflammation (GEE, 1915b, p.95). Thesepublic proclamations about the use of laboratory science in general show thatGEE was not frightened to discuss its worth in front of eminent audiences. [43]GEE's advocacy of opposing ideas was part of his personality. LEGG (1915,p.359) wrote that "GEE's character was exceedingly complex, and it is verydifficult to unravel." GEE (1915c, pp.216 and 229; MS35, p.241) wrote publiclyand privately about his dislike of dogmatism. In spite of these attacks ondogmatism, GEE (1915c, p.236) had a "kindly feeling" towards the "Empiric sect",which was, apparently, although in his category of dogmatic sects, "much lessdogmatic" than his other examples. GEE is not the glowing example of anadvocate of empiricism which he has been portrayed as though, as he states that"the empiric … is the ant which gathers facts but does not transmute them … hisharvests are scanty. Well for him that all physicians are not empirics" (GEE,1915c, pp.239-40)14. Indeed, LEGG (1915, p.363) considered GEE a sceptic15.GEE's lack of conviction about anything is demonstrated by LEGG's recollectionthat GEE's"opinions on one subject, books or men, rarely last the same for any time. One wouldhave talk with him, and a fortnight after resume the conversation at the point where itwas left off and then it would be found that the whole tone of his thought hadchanged" (LEGG, 1915, p.380). [44]Indeed, his aphoristic style of writing, privately, and publicly in HORDER'scollection of his aphorisms, is perfect for GEE's undogmatic and eclectic way ofthinking. GEE wrote privately, "[t]he advantage of the aphoristic way of writing isthat no pretence of completeness is made; facts may be added withoutdisarranging the structure" (GEE, MS34, p.124). GEE (MS34, pp.126 and 140-141) also doubted the reliability of new "facts", and wrote twice about this problemin his notebook. [45]This doubt in GEE's thinking helps to explain why he may have been slightlyreticent about the new experimental sciences infiltrating clinical medicine. Heappears to have considered many innovations and new ideas, not accepting anybelief in particular. He did not wholly accept empiricism or experimental science.LEGG's (1915, p.363) comment, "[t]hough he knew so much, yet his scepticismwas very deep" sums up what is clear about GEE—he was interested in14 See LAWRENCE (2000, pp.47-49) for GEE being represented as "revering" empiricism.15 This is in GEE's opposing group to dogmatism (GEE, 1915c, p.242).© 2007 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920everything, accepted ideas and technologies on his own terms, and was ready tochange his mind. [46]Not surprisingly, GEE's discourse in his case notes was as complex as hiswritings and medical practice. In case notes supervised or written by him,"natural" and "normal" were used fairly equally in the 1880s and 1890s. However,use of "normal" for temperature far outweighed use for qualitative descriptions oforgans and parts of the body. Therefore, GEE's notes are representative ofpatterns of use of language at Bart's in general. [47]Recently, Lorraine DASTON and H. Otto SIBUM (2003) have discussed thepossibility of scientists, and people in general, having different personaedepending on the context. However, the traditional idea of double lives considerspeople have secrets to hide (GOFFMAN, 1969, especially Chapter 4). The casestudy of GEE questions this idea, showing that he did not hide his use ofbacteriology. However, in this paper the use of the concept of "double lives" is aheuristic device in order to examine how gentlemen physicians were able tointegrate the specialist laboratory into their clinical practice. The way in whichGEE presented ways of using bacteriology to eminent audiences demonstratesthat this was entirely possible. [48]Part of the confusion regarding GEE's attitude towards experimental science maystem from his self-representation in the wards. In one of his notebooks, GEE(MS34, p.169) wrote:"Always remember that the work in the Wards, so far as students are concerned, issimply the education of their senses. Pathology they can read at home. Waste notime over it. The pulse is dicrotous. What does dicrotism signify? Never mind, feelthat it is dicrotous, + when you get home refer to your books." [49]GEE may have given people the impression that laboratory science was notimportant to him by not "wasting time" discussing it on the wards. [50]Gentlemen physicians may have presented various images of themselves inorder to defend their profession. Diagnosis was perhaps the most importanttechnique for a physician. Thomas HORDER and his colleague at Bart's, A.E.GOW (1952, p.xiii), considered diagnosis was the "be-all and the end-all" ofmedicine. Bacteriology was quite a threat to physicians, as their major role wasbeing challenged (MAULITZ, 1979, p.92)16. There was reason for the physicians tobe cautious about the impact of bacteriology, in order to defend their status. [51]In the 1920s and '30s, HORDER (1937a, p.32; HORDER, 1937b, pp.174-5 and181) seems to have been worried about the profession of the clinician due to theattitude of the public. In his experience, patients were growing increasinglyconvinced of the power of machines and experts. In 1924 he remarked on how16 LAWRENCE (1999, p.427) comments on diagnosis as the "cornerstone of medicine", repeatedin LAWRENCE (2000, p.49). HAMMONDS (1999, p.11) also considers that change indiagnostic practices of diphtheria was seen as a threat to the medical profession of New York.© 2007 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920lay people were treating doctors as though they had "no expert knowledgewhatever", putting forward ideas such as possible causes of cancer (HORDER,1924, p.822). Patients were coming to see him armed with X-rays and ideasabout the reasons for their illnesses (HORDER, 1937b, p.183). He defended hisprofession, stressing the importance of "human judgment" (HORDER, 1937b,p.174). Patients were coming to him having already had diagnostic tests to savetime and money. One patient would not allow HORDER to even examine him,saying, "please give me something for my headache: I don't want a diagnosis, itcosts too much" (HORDER, 1937b, p.184). [52]Professionally, however, the position of pathologist was not as grand as being aphysician. Indeed, ANDREWES (1928, p.116) expected to become a physician atBart's as he already held a position at the Royal Free Hospital. Giving this up was"a big change in one's life", but he realised he "loved laboratory work more thanOut-Patients." The income of a pathologist was much lower than that of a hospitalphysician. Although the physicians had campaigned for £600 a year for the Bart'spathologist, he only received £100 with no time for private practice. The physi-cians were paid under 100 guineas at Bart's, but through private practice theycould achieve huge salaries (SBH Ha 6/5 1895; SBH Ha 1/27 1895). The Bart'spractitioners, Sir James PAGET and John ABERNETHY, from earlier in thenineteenth century, earned in excess of £10,000 a year at their peak (WADDING-TON, 1984, p.32). In a meeting between the Treasurer and the Medical Councilat Bart's in 1895, the Treasurer said regarding the Medical Council's proposedsalary for the Pathologist, "[o]f course £600 a year is not a large or even anadequate payment, but still all that class of work is not highly paid" (SBH Ha 6/51895). So, this low status of the bacteriologist shows why the physicians mayhave thought it safe to discuss the value of bacteriology in public. [53]8. ConclusionCase notes have been shown in this paper to have considerable worth indiscovering what actually happened everyday in the life of the elite Londonhospital in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. They reveal thechange in rhetoric used in the hospital over time, and what this may haveindicated for the "double life" of the physician—conflicted between the old worldof bedside medicine and the new world of the laboratory, and holding onto the oldworld by continuing to use its language. [54]Although Addenbrooke's Hospital was more similar to the U.S. in its reception ofthe laboratory, "natural" was still used more frequently at later dates than in theU.S. The difference in the domination of the term "normal" in Cambridge from theU.S. deserves further investigation, especially due to the prominence ofexperimental physiology in Cambridge. Differences between Bart's, andAddenbrooke's and the U.S., can be explained more easily. Older physicians hadmore of an influence on the creation of case notes at Bart's, the reputation ofphysiology teaching and research did not rival Cambridge, and the examination ofGEE shows that medical practice was perhaps torn between an old and a newworld for medicine, with physicians wanting to utilise the laboratory for the benefit© 2007 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920of their practice, but perhaps afraid of the threat to their profession. It may alsosimply be that at Bart's there was a cognitive distinction between a quantifiablemeasure and a qualitative description meaning that though temperature wasalmost universally described as "normal", organs and features such as colourwere not. This distinction can be further supported as the use of bacteriologicalmethods was enthusiastically received so there was not an opposition tolaboratory science. [55]An examination of case notes based on language alone would represent Bart's asreluctant to accept the fruits of the experimental laboratory. So, at first glance,language does not mirror practice. However, using cluster analysis, especially oftemperature, this is shown not to be the case, and perhaps this slightconservatism regarding language at Bart's relates to the confusingrepresentations of the gentlemen physicians torn between a world based onbedside experience and one based on experimental science. [56]AcknowledgementsI would like to thank the continued support of the Arts and Humanities ResearchCouncil, who have funded my career since embarking on my Masters degree inthe History of Science, Medicine and Technology, including the doctoral thesisfrom which this paper has been developed. My PhD supervisor, AndrewMENDELSOHN has provided general wise advice for this paper, as have JohnHarley WARNER and Kati HANNKEN-ILLJES who both encouraged me todevelop this work by conducting cluster analyses of the ways in which "natural"and "normal" were used. Thanks also to WARNER for kindly allowing me toreproduce the graph from The Therapeutic Perspective. The archivists at both St.Bartholomew's Hospital (Samantha FARHALL, Marion RAE and KatieORMEROD) and Addenbrooke's Hospital (Hilary RITCHIE and Philip RUNDLE)have been very supportive, and have given me lots of useful advice on the historyof the hospitals. Helpful assistance was also received in my research at the RoyalCollege of Physicians, London. This work was originally prepared for theKolloqium: "Diskurs, Zeit und Materialität", Freie Universität, Berlin, in 2004, and Iwould like to thank the members (especially Livia HOLDEN) of the Emmy-Noether Gruppe "Mikrosoziologie von Strafverfahren" for their invitation topresent my work at this forum.© 2007 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 8(1), Art. 17, Rosemary Wall: "Natural", "Normal": Discourse and Practice at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,London, and Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1880-1920Appendix: Archive SourcesAddenbrooke's Hospital Archives, CambridgeMedical casebooks, 1880-1920, AHPR1/1.<ref>Royal College of Physicians, LondonSamuel Gee, Volume III of Notes, 1865-, MS34.</ref><ref>Samuel Gee, Notebook I, 1873-.
