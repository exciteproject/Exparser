Health Shocks, Job Quality, and Self-Employment in Africa∗Courtney Monk†and Francis TealCentre for the Study of African EconomiesDepartment of EconomicsUniversity of OxfordJanuary 2008AbstractThis paper examines the relationship between occupation and diﬀerent types of humancapital—skills, education, ability and health. Summary statistics of our panel data from theGhana Household Worker Survey strongly suggest that height and health vary by occupa-tion. Our regression results show that after controlling for age, gender and movement outof jobs, the self-employed are the most likely to have at least one day of illness (a healthshock) in the past year. However, conditional on having at least one day of illness, theself-employed have the lowest expected number of days ill. On the other hand, evidencethat large ﬁrm workers have longer illnesses than other workers, perhaps reﬂecting theirbetter employment circumstances that allow more time oﬀ when sick, cautions against theuse of days of illness as a measure of health that is unbiased by occupational choice. Wealso investigate labour market outcomes and ﬁnd that the number of days ill does not aﬀectthe labour supply decision. Controlling for entry into the labour force, however, days ofillness does have a signiﬁcant negative impact on earnings, especially if it exceeds 30 days.Our analysis suggests that changes in health and changes in occupation are strongly cor-related; understanding the causal links in this relationship should be the focus of future work.Keywords: Self-employment; Africa; HealthJEL Classiﬁcation Codes: O12; J24∗The data used in this paper were collected by the Centre for the Study of African Economies (CSAE),Oxford, in collaboration with the Ghana Statistical Oﬃce (GSO) in 2006.

The limited literature on the expansion of self-employment disagrees on this is-sue. Looking at movements into and out of self-employment in Mexico, Fajnzylber, Maloney,and Rojas (2006) conclude that self-employment is just as desirable as other labour marketalternatives. In contrast, Sandefur, Serneels, and Teal (2006) use labour market data for theurban sector in Ghana, Tanzania and Ethiopia to show that incomes for the self-employed andthose in small ﬁrms are substantially less than those in large ﬁrms and the public sector (seealso S¨oderbam, Teal, and Wambugu (2005)). Thus earnings diﬀerentials imply that the qualityof self-employment and jobs in microenterprises might be substantially inferior compared toemployment in large ﬁrms.Yet these ﬁndings ignore the eﬀects of health on occupational choice and earnings and the reverseeﬀects of occupation and income on health. Indeed, there is evidence in the literature that healthshocks result in a loss in income due to reductions in labor supply and/or productivity (Gertler& Gruber, 2002), and that healthier individuals earn more. In other words, our analysis will beincomplete if we ignore health.We therefore explore the relationships between employment status, health outcomes and wagesin Africa. We are particularly interested in the self-employed and use two waves from newpanel data from the Ghana Household Worker Survey to investigate job quality and healthfor these individuals. The key to understanding the nature of this relationship is observingthe individual at diﬀerent points in time, so as to observe movements between jobs, changesin income and shocks to health. Our panel data set, which is collected at the individual leveland contains detailed health and income information, is ideally suited to consider this problem.We also incorporate data on skills and health knowledge, to see how the various aspects of2human capital (health, education, skills and ability) come into play. The temporal aspect of thepanel gives us the opportunity to investigate whether the movement out of certain jobs impactshealth. Whether or not these movements are caused by or are the cause of health shocks isan equally interesting element of health outcomes and has obvious implications for assessingjob quality. Dynamic extensions of this kind, as well as exploring the role of lagged health onpresent health, are particularly insightful.In this paper we use data from an urban sample in Ghana to look directly at the eﬀect of pastillness and current job choice on current income, as well as the impact of past income and pastjob status on current health. We begin by using the data to ask if job type varies along arange of measures of health outcomes that can be observed in the data. As measuring health isa diﬃcult undertaking, we consider two measures for which we have consistent measurementsacross the survey years: height and inactive days due to illness or injury.In our in-depth analysis, we are aware that identifying the eﬀects we are interested in is diﬃcultand confounded by simultaneity and endogeneity issues. First, while health as an outcomeis a major dimension of job quality, there is a concern that health may aﬀect employmentstatus by determining participation in the labour force (see Currie and Madrian (1999) for areview). In addition, it is also plausible for health to inﬂuence preferences for job type, so thatunhealthy individuals favour jobs in which lower productivity is required. This may be more ofa factor among the poorest individuals. Indeed, nutrition-based eﬃciency wage models implythat the sickest individuals will be left out of the formal sector. Theory and empirical evidenceboth suggest that nutrition, through its impact on overall health, strength, and endurance, isan important determinant of worker productivity (Strauss, 1986; Deolalikar, 1988; Thomas &Strauss, 1997). There are also potential feedback eﬀects because productivity increases income,which in turn can be reinvested in health by buying more inputs or higher-quality inputs (Strauss& Thomas, 1998).We attempt to establish causality and address these issues of simultaneity by combining theindividual data with data at the household level. More importantly, observing past changes3in health and income allows us to control for past unobservables and avoid the problem ofsimultaneous feedback eﬀects. We show that past health shocks decrease current income, andthat skills matter both for health and income. The evidence shows that the self-employed maybe worse oﬀ in terms of health outcomes, as they have a higher likelihood of falling ill. Jobmovements, especially those out of self-employment and large ﬁrms, do play a role in the healthstory, although the direction of causality is as of yet unclear. Conversely, income has a complexrelationship with health, in that people who earn more are more likely to report an illness, butalso experience shorter illnesses conditional on having any days ill. This supports the idea thatthose with better jobs and higher incomes can aﬀord to be ill.This paper proceeds in ﬁve sections. Section 2 oﬀers a brief review of the literature. Section 3sets out our theoretical framework and empirical strategy, and Section 4 oﬀers relevant detailsabout the data. Results are presented in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes with ideas forfurther research.2Empirical EvidenceDealing with the complicated interdependent relationships between health, wages, and laboursupply is a challenge (see Strauss and Thomas (1998) for a very comprehensive review). Ingeneral, the consensus is that better health raises labour participation and wages, and thathealth shocks lower income and consumption.2.1Developed countriesLabour economists who look at health issues have been most interested in the eﬀects of health onwages. Research on data from developed countries is more common that research on developingcountries. Due to the rarity of panel data, most have focused primarily on the causal pathwaysbetween current health and current income and the endogeneity problems that arise with thisapproach (Lee, 1982; Ettner, 1996). Relatively little research has been able to exploit inter-temporal changes in health and income, although a limited number of studies have contributed4to this area.Haveman, Wolfe, Kreider, and Stone (1994) use a 3-equation structural model and panel dataon American white men. The three equations describe health, hours worked (labour supply),and wages. Health here is measured on a zero to three scale indicating the degree to which amedical condition limits one’s ability to work. The authors conclude that prior (lagged) poorhealth lowers wages and work time.In an approach similar to our own, Smith (2003) investigates the impact on past health changesand changes in socio-economic indicators, like income, on today’s health. He also looks at theimpact of health changes (shocks) on current income and labour supply. Unfortunately, he isonly about to look at household income, rather than individual income, but ﬁnds that healthshocks have a sharp negative eﬀect on income, operating mainly through labour supply and notthrough medical expenses.2.2Developing CountriesMuch of the work on developing countries focuses either on the simultaneous relationship be-tween health and earnings (Thomas & Strauss, 1997; Schultz, 2003; Schultz & Tansel, 1997;Savedoﬀ & Schultz, 2000), or the eﬀect of health shocks on consumption (Wagstaﬀ, 2006; Dercon& Hoddinott, 2003; Pitt & Rosenzweig, 1986). The existing literature that uses panel data toexamine health shocks and income shocks has been somewhat limited. In addition, as income ismost often measured at the household level, determining the true eﬀects of health on individualincome has been diﬃcult. We believe that our ability to measure income at the individual levelwill give us a much better picture of the true eﬀect of a health shock on labour outcomes.Gertler and Gruber (2002) use a panel data set from Indonesia, which allows them to look atthe eﬀect of major health shocks on changes (ﬁrst diﬀerences) in labour supply, income andmedical expenses, and the resulting ability of households to smooth consumption. Their healthmeasure is the individual’s ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs). Their resultsshow that larger health shocks result in larger income losses, but they do not model a recursive5health equation in addition their labour outcomes equation.Lindelow and Wagstaﬀ (2005) use a similar ﬁrst diﬀerences approach with Chinese data andﬁnd that illness results in large declines in labour supply and income. However, the incomedata was measured only at the household level and then calculated on a per capita basis.3Theoretical FrameworkThe theoretical model developed by Grossman (1972) views health as an endogenously deter-mined capital stock. Grossman’s premise is that health capital diﬀers from other forms of humancapital because the stock of health “determines the total amount of time [one] can spend pro-ducing money earnings and commodities” (Grossman, 1972, p. 224). The model predicts thathealth should be positively correlated with wages, for better health will increase productivityand thus wages, and higher wages will increase the demand for health and medical care.Let us think, as Grossman does, of health outcomes as a function of several inputs. An adultindividual produces health H, which is determined by various factors:Ht = H(Ht−1, It−1, wt−1, Bt, D(t,h), U, e(t,h))(1)where It−1 is a vector of health inputs, wt−1 is prior wage (in logs), B is a vector of familybackground characteristics, and D(t,h) is a vector of community level variables aﬀecting health.The underlying time-invariant “healthiness” of the individual, U , is unobservable but known bythe individual, while e(t,h) is the component that is both unknown and unobservable to all, e.g.measurement error.Meanwhile, there exists a relationship that relates the log of real wages w in period t to severalinputs (Mincer, 1974):wt = w(wt−1, Ht−1, Et, Bt, D(t,w), A, e(t,w))(2)where Et is education and Dt,w are community level infrastructure variables. Unobservabletime-invariant qualities known to the individual like ability are included in A; e(t,w) captures6measurement error and random ﬂuctuations in wt.3.1Empirical ModelFrom the framework above, we develop two approaches. First, we look at health and income ina setting without a lag of the dependent variable, for which the model to be estimated can bethought of as:Hi,t = α0 + α1Xi,t + α2Ji,t−1 + ui,1twi,t = β0 + β1Hi,t−1 + β2Xi,t + β3Ji,t + ui,2twhere Xt is a vector of time-varying and time-invariant individual characteristics, and Jt andJt−1 are vectors of job characteristics. We measure Ht as the inactive days in the past yearcaused by illness or injury.We extend this model to incorporate dynamics of the dependent variable, creating structuralequations that relate health and income in the following way:Hi,t = α0 + α1Hi,t−1 + α2wi,t−1 + α3Xi,t + α4Ji,t−1 + ηi + ui,1twi,t = β0 + β1Hi,t−1 + β2wi,t−1 + β3Xi,t + β4Ji,t + ηi + ui,2tBecause we are dealing with panel data, this kind of model brings up some serious endogeneityissues, as Hi,t−1 and wi,t−1 will be correlated with the individual eﬀects ηi. We are able todeal with this for the wage equation, by instrumenting wi,t−1 with wi,t−2, available from the2004 wave of the survey. However, we have not yet found a suitable instrument for Hi,t−1;nevertheless, by comparing the static and dynamic results, it is strong evidence that the biasresulting from this source of endogeneity in the health equation may not be a big concern.We also use a selection equation to account for labour participation, as the wage in Equations 4and 6 is only observed if one enters the labour force. This stage is identiﬁed with three variables:number of children, a dummy for being married or not, and a dummy indicating one’s statusas the household head.7(3)(4)(5)(6)Our identiﬁcation strategy is dependent on the ability of height to capture one’s history of healthand nutrition inputs, so that we can successfully use height as a control for long-term healththat may or may not impact the short-term measure of inactive days.1 The main advantage ofthis speciﬁcation is that it allows us to see the eﬀect of a prior health shock on today’s income,while controlling for other confounding factors, and without worrying about the endogeneityintroduced by the contemporaneous feedback of current income onto current health.24DataThe data are from the 2005 and 2006 waves of the Ghana Household Worker Survey (GHWS)conducted by the Centre for African Studies (CSAE). The survey is a representative sampleof adult workers in urban areas in Ghana (Accra, Kumasi, Takoradi, and Cape Coast). Thenumber of individuals in this 2005-2006 panel is 1,073, from which 200 were dropped from oursample due to missing values, because they were students, or because they were younger than15 or older than 60, leaving us with 873 individuals. Table 4 presents simple summary statisticsfor this sample.Great care has been taken in the design of the GHWS to measure incomes for workers in boththe formal and non-formal sectors. In particular, the information collected on the self-employedis very detailed and, in contrast to many other surveys, allows for much more accuracy whendetermining earnings. This unique aspect of the GHWS means that we have individual levelearnings information for employees in all types of employment.4.1SkillsThe 2006 wave of the GHWS includes data from four skills tests and a health knowledge test.The skills tests include a Raven’s test, an English test, a mathematics test, and a reading test.1There is some evidence in very recent literature regarding the endogeneity of height with respect to earnings(Schultz, 2002); however, we assume here that height is predetermined, as is common practice.2The endogeneity of the education variable in the earnings equation, due to omitted variables like ability andschool quality, has been well discussed in the labour economics literature. We do not instrument for educationin this paper, as it is not the focus of the analysis; however, previous work on the same data has concluded thatinstrumenting education does not alter its eﬀects on earnings (Sandefur et al., 2006).8Both the mathematics and reading tests have two sections (elementary and more advanced),which are weighted accordingly in the scoring. The health knowledge test is comprehensive,covering such topics as sources, signs and home treatments for common ailments like diarrheaand heat stroke, as well as a few speciﬁc items like polio, malaria, and nutrition.Although these tests allow for admittedly crude assessments of one’s true skills, they aremuch more informative than simple subjective questions regarding literacy and numeracy. TheRaven’s test is interesting in itself, as it tries to ascertain one’s natural intelligence, irrespec-tive of schooling. Having access to such rich data about dimensions of human capital is rare,rendering our results unique and new.Looking at some summary statistics on skills in Table 1, there are clearly strong diﬀerencesin worker characteristics across occupations. This suggests that there is a strong selectionmechanism of highly skilled workers into good jobs, although some of this is undoubtedly drivenby age and gender. In addition, we cannot rule out the reverse possibility that some of theseskills are acquired or improved in some occupational settings and not in others. What is mostimpressive in this table, however, is that those who do not earn any income are actually “moreskilled” than the average person in the sample in almost everything except health knowledge. Infact, they are more skilled on average than those in the work force as well. This ﬁnding supportsthe claim that high-skilled workers who are unemployed do not enter self-employment duringtheir unemployment spell but prefer to keep searching for a good formal sector job.4.2The Health VariablesThe health measures that we will focus on are height and the number of days in the pastyear that one has been unable to do one’s normal activity. These variables both suﬀer frommeasurement error. For height, however, only 1.6% of the measurements seemed to be obviouslymis-measured and were treated as missing, and we were able to use data from the 2004 waveof the panel to ﬁll in some missing height values. Furthermore, in the sample that we use forthe results in this paper, characteristics such as gender, age and years of education do not have9predictive power over whether a height measurement is grossly mis-measured or whether it ismissing. Therefore, we do not expect the measurement error in the height variable to causesigniﬁcant endogeneity issues.In the case of days of illness reported, measurement error is probably present, as is the possibilitythat more educated and wealthier people may be more likely to report illness (Schultz & Tansel,1997), and labour supply decisions may be endogenous to this variable as people try to justifyleaving employment due to health reasons. Another potential problem with our days of illnessvariable is that the 2005 survey and 2006 survey were not identical in the way in which thesequestions were asked. In 2005, respondents were asked for the number of days ill in the pastthree months, whereas in 2006, respondents’ frame of reference was a year. Therefore, to matchthe 2006 year-long framework, the 2005 days ill variable has been adjusted.3 In addition, the2006 survey asked for the number episodes of illness experienced during the past year (up toa maximum of three episodes), and the corresponding number of days ill suﬀered during eachepisode. From this information, we construct an aggregated number of days ill across thesethree episodes. Information about days ill is unavailable for any additional episodes, althoughonly about 1% of the sample reports having more than three episodes, so we do not think thishas resulted in a downward bias in the days ill measure.Some summary statistics regarding occupation and health status are helpful. For the wholesample, 32% reported at least one day of illness in the last year. Table 2 breaks down daysof illness in the past year by wave of the survey, gender, and occupation. It is not altogetherclear yet from this table what the relationship between occupation and illness is. Women tendto suﬀer more disabled days than men. Workers in small ﬁrms report less illness than others,perhaps because their job stability is relatively precarious. The unemployed and self-employed3It is possible to simply multiply the 2005 measure by four. This makes the strong assumption that healthover the past three months is representative of health over the past year. Instead, we took information abouthealth over the last year provided in 2005, in which a person noted his/her frequency of illness, which determinedthe factor by which the 2005 days of illness measure was multiplied. For example, someone with 20 days of illnessin the last three months, but who also reported being ill “almost all of the time” was then deemed to have 80days of illness in the past year. In any case, this adjustment, as compared with simply multiplying all of the 2005measurements by four, did not change the results or our conclusions in any signiﬁcant way. It simply allowed fora smoother empirical distribution and hopefully better estimation.10tend to have more days of illness than the average working individual.It is also quite interesting to look at the distribution of height by occupation, shown in Figure1. This graph shows clearly the stark diﬀerences in mean across occupations, with employeesof large ﬁrms and those in the public sector being much taller than others.55.1ResultsEﬀects for HealthTo examine the health-occupation relationship, we ﬁrst consider the simple model without thecomplications caused by including a lagged measure of health. Focusing, for the moment, ondays of illness as the dependent variable: we have several possible empirical strategies to dealwith this type of variable since it is has a high proportion of zeros, a very long tail, and is acount. We chose to focus on a probit model, in which the dependent variable takes the value ofone if an individual reported one or more days of illness, but we also oﬀer OLS estimates anda count regression conditional on at least one day of illness.4Estimates from the probit model are found in Table 6 (Table 3 oﬀers variable deﬁnitions). Thereare several things to note from this table, although we can start with the basics. Males are lesslikely to suﬀer illness, but this eﬀect is not signiﬁcant. Age on its own has a positive impact onthe probability of having an illness, and its relationship is convex, so age has increasing marginaleﬀects. Surprisingly, education has nothing to do with illness here. Height is also insigniﬁcant,suggesting that these short-term illnesses observed in this limited time-frame are pure shocksand have little to do with underlying “healthiness”.In addition, the NHIS variable, a community-level measurement of the proportion of peoplereporting that they have registered to receive one of the new National Health Insurance Scheme(NHIS) cards, is worth noting. It is signiﬁcant, and controlling for all other variables at theirmeans, a one percent increase in one’s community’s take-up rate decreases one’s probability of4We also estimated a tobit model, which conﬁrmed the results reported here. Those results are available uponrequest.11falling ill by just under one percent.In columns 1 to 3, we see that previous occupational choice does not seem to have a signiﬁcantimpact on becoming sick, except for those in big ﬁrms, who have a higher likelihood of fallingill. (The reference group here are those who earned no income last year.) This is most likelya result of the fact that workers in big ﬁrms ‘can aﬀord to be ill.’ Moreover, the relationshipbetween lagged occupation and the actual number of days ill is rather large, as can be seen inthe OLS estimates in Table 7 and in the NegBin results in Table 8. These two tables coincidewith what the summary statistics suggested, that those who are unemployed in the past yearexperience many more days of illness on average than others.Finding that large ﬁrm workers may have more days of illness is consistent with the fact thatemployment circumstances for workers in big ﬁrms tend to be much better. On the otherhand, it does suggest that days of illness may not be the best measure of health with which toinvestigate occupational eﬀects. While we are trying to assess job quality, it may be job qualityitself which is driving some of the variation in days of illness; in the future, we will need to lookat more health measures in order to know how strong this phenomenon is.After controlling for movement out of employment types, we are able to identify a much strongereﬀect of self-employment (refer to columns 4-7, Table 6). Now, the self-employed have thehighest probability of falling ill, relative to all other categories. However, those who get out ofself-employment do just as well as the others; the null hypothesis of whether the coeﬃcientson “self-empl. last year” and “left self-empl.” sum to zero is accepted, so we have isolateda positive relationship between self-employment and the probability of getting sick. whereasleaving a large ﬁrm is associated with a big rise. We cannot be sure of the direction of causalityhere—people may leave jobs because of health reasons, or health may alter job choice decisions—so interpretation is diﬃcult. Nonetheless, it is a very interesting ﬁnding that the pattern of jobchoice is key to understanding how occupation and health interact.The skills results are a little more diﬃcult to interpret. Columns 5 and 6 show the addition of12the skills variables. Innate ability, indicated by the Raven score, is linked to a higher probabilityof illness: scoring ten percent higher on the Raven’s test raises the probability by roughly ﬁvepercent; the result for reading ability is similar. In contrast, English skills have a downwardeﬀect on the probability of illness.We also show the results for including health knowledge and then instrumenting it with parentaleducation and number of children in columns 6 and 7, respectively.5 It is obvious from theseresults that health knowledge is indeed highly endogenous to health, i.e. the more unhealthyone is, the more knowledge one acquires. Once instrumented, health knowledge and probabilityof illness are negatively related, which makes more sense intuitively—presumably the more oneknows about health, the more one can prevent illness.Moving on from the binary restriction imposed by the probit, we turn brieﬂy to a zero-truncatednegative binomial model of days ill (Table 8). The dependent variable is number of days ill,for individuals with at least one day. The estimation precision may suﬀer from the low numberof observations, but the regression is nonetheless an interesting addition to the informationprovided by the probit. Being male reduces the expected count by 34%. Those without earnedincome in the last year have much more days of illness than the self-employed and those insmall ﬁrms. In fact, the self-employed have the lowest number of days of illness. This couldbe because they are actually healthier and thus have more minor illnesses. But combining thiswith our evidence from the probit, the results support the alternative argument that the self-employed’s work circumstances are inferior to those of market sector workers: not only do theget sick with the highest probability, but they then stay sick for the shortest amount of time,presumably because they have to return to work.Employment in a big ﬁrm is associated with a more than doubling of inactive days, which isagain some evidence that those whose job security is less tenuous may enjoy more time forconvalescence. Similar to the probit model, job movement seems to be important, although5We use a control function approach here, regressing health knowledge on the exogenous regressors; the resultsof this ﬁrst stage can be found in Table 5.13more so for those moving out of large ﬁrms and those moving into the labour force or out ofself-employment.The skills estimates are all signiﬁcant. For those who are sick, it seems that intelligence andnumeracy help you to get well, whereas English knowledge and literacy are linked to longerspells of illness. It is unclear at this point what exactly this means.5.2Eﬀects for EarningsLet us now look at the selection equation for earned income (Table 9), the ﬁrst stage of ourearnings analysis. The variables that identify this selection are number of children, a dummyfor married, and a dummy for household head.Gender is not a signiﬁcant determinant of earning an income. That men and women have similaremployment rates may be a bit surprising, but this is probably because women are more likelyto be self-employed, and our binary earned income variable does not pick up on this nuance.Some may also question why the Raven score variable is negative, and the rest of the skills andeducation are insigniﬁcant. One would expect those who do not earn income to be on average,less educated and less able. The answer may have something to do with signalling and workerquality. It is likely that high quality workers stay out of the labour force, waiting for a goodjob to come along, and do not seek self-employment in the interim because they fear it wouldsend a negative signal to potential (good) employers. Therefore, many of those without incomemay in fact be more qualiﬁed than not.As for the health factors, neither height nor the health shock (days ill last year) are important.Although a past illness enters negatively, therefore decreasing the probability of having earnedincome, it is statistically insigniﬁcant.6Now, we can turn to the earnings equations in Table 10. The table shows the results of regressingthe log of monthly wages on several explanatory variables. Columns 1 through 4 are estimates6A possible extension, that is beyond the scope of this paper, is to investigate further the fact that heightdoes clearly have something to do with occupation through a multinomial logit selection equation.14without controlling for selection, and Columns 5-8 include an inverse Mills ratio (‘heckman’)from the probit for earned income (the full model from Column 4, Table 9). The ﬁrst columnoﬀers a standard speciﬁcation, in which hours, gender, age, education, and occupation all aﬀectearnings signiﬁcantly. Here, it is clear that men earn more than women, and that age, whichmay also pick up experience, raises earnings but at a decreasing rate. Employees in small ﬁrmsearn signiﬁcantly less than the self-employed, and they both earn much less than others in largeﬁrms and the public sector. When skills are added, the overall picture remains the same. Andalthough the skills variables take away some of the education eﬀect, they certainly do not wipeit out, which means that the skills are picking up characteristics that are not measured withyears of schooling.A previous illness, or health shock, has a negative impact on wages, but height does not playany role. This suggests that short-term shocks may aﬀect income but long-term health doesnot. Moreover, if health is controlling for the unobservables associated with health, then this isa very strong result indeed. It must be acknowledged that outliers have a strong eﬀect, and thiseﬀect loses its statistical signiﬁcance if we take out those people who experienced more than 14days of illness last year. Even so, it is clear that for some people, who have serious illnesses,these do have a downward impact on earnings.After controlling for selection, the health shock is still signiﬁcant (column 7), but we lose ourability to identify this eﬀect precisely when we put the whole model together by adding inskills (column 8). Ability, measured by the Raven’s score, enters strongly here and increasesearnings.5.3Dynamic Eﬀects for HealthLet us now consider a dynamic setting, in which lagged health is included as a determinant ofcurrent health, and lagged earnings is included in the earnings equation. This autoregressivemodel brings up new econometric issues, which have yet to be fully addressed by the authors.However, we include them here because they are an integral part of understanding the inter-15temporal nature of the health-income relationship.The estimates for the dynamic probit model are presented in Table 11. It is easy to verify thatthe point estimates, compared with Table 6, are nearly identical, which may be good evidencethat the lagged health variable does not introduce too much bias, although we cannot rule outthis possibility. As the results are so similar, we will limit our discussion here to the laggeddays ill variable, which is positive and signiﬁcant. An 10-day increase in illness suﬀered in theprevious year translates into a 7% greater chance of falling ill this year.Again, it is possible that this eﬀect is being driven by outliers, and if we aggressively restrictthe sample to people without long illness spells, the eﬀect’s statistical signiﬁcance diminishes.Using a dummy to indicate an illness in the previous year is also statistically insigniﬁcant forthe whole sample. If we instead use a dummy that indicates a long sickness (over 1 month) inthe previous year, the point estimates of the other variables are essentially unchanged, whilethe dummy for a big health shock is statistically signiﬁcant and shows that having a severeillness last year increases the chances of falling ill this year by over 50%. This is importantevidence of the persistence of illness, especially for those who experience a somewhat severehealth shock.5.3.1Earnings or Occupation?This occupational eﬀect on illness that we have uncovered by including dummies for job move-ment may have more to do with income variations across occupation than the occupation itself.In order to investigate this question, we need to limit the sample size to those for whom wehave observed earned income. These results are presented in Table 12.If we narrow our sample accordingly and control for the level of lagged income, it is true thatthe lagged occupation eﬀects lose their statistical signiﬁcance in the probit model for havingany illness—income, for which the coeﬃcient is signiﬁcant, overrides the occupational diﬀer-ences. However, the dummy for leaving self-employment is still negative and weakly signiﬁcant,although we have trouble identifying it when the skills are added to the model. The eﬀect of16the income level is positive, so that higher income is associated with a higher probability of anysickness. Again, this may be because those with higher incomes can aﬀord to be ill. When werun a count regression but control for the level of income, the coeﬃcient on income is negativebut insigniﬁcant. Nevertheless, even if some of the occupational eﬀect on health is workingthrough earnings, it does not take away from the fact that workers in diﬀerent occupationsexperience diﬀerent health outcomes.5.4Dynamic Eﬀects for EarningsTo examine the dynamic relationship in the earnings equation, we must limit the sample tothose people for whom we observe earned income in both 2005 and 2006. Estimates are oﬀeredin Table 14 (refer to Table 13 for the relevant comparison of the same sample but without thelog of last year’s wage).It is immediately clear that the previous year’s log wage dominates almost all of the otherexplanatory variables. Earnings is clearly a persistent process, and last year’s earnings is astrong, signiﬁcant determinant of earnings today. Column 9-IV is an instrumental variablesmodel which instruments the lag of log wage with an individual’s log wage from 2004 to try topurge some of the bias inherent to the dynamic linear panel model.7 This raises the estimate,but does not change the conclusions. Interestingly, last year’s days of illness variable is stillsigniﬁcant, despite the power of lagged wages. This is a key result and implies that the eﬀectof a health shock is potentially very strong. Given our earned income probit ﬁndings, weconclude that health shocks impact directly on earnings rather than indirectly through labourparticipation.6Conclusion: Policy ImplicationsThis paper attempts to assess the impact of various dimensions of human capital on earningsas well as the relationships between some of these dimensions and health. Skills and ability7For some individuals in the sample this was a predicted value from the regression of 2004 log wage on the2004 levels of age, education, gender, occupation, and job tenure.17deﬁnitely play a role in short-term health, but they are not as important for earnings. Educationis not a signiﬁcant player, nor is health knowledge. Looking closer at the education-healthrelationship is a potential improvement on our present analysis. In particular, determiningwhether health operates indirectly through education is an interesting question but is beyondthe scope of this paper.We also investigate the possibility of a virtuous or vicious cycle by which good (poor) healthleads to improved (lower) incomes which leads to improved (poorer) health. We present evidencethat occupational status, job movements and health are linked. Health shocks do not aﬀect thechoice between working and not working, and that illness, at least for some who experienceserious health shocks, is persistent over time. Health shocks do have a negative eﬀect onearnings, especially for those who have recently been severely ill.Overall, the question of whether higher incomes in large ﬁrms translate into better health ishighly relevant for policy, as we decide whether promotion of microenterprises is truly a pro-poorstrategy along non-income dimensions of welfare. We ﬁnd some evidence that self-employmentmay cause bad health, but we do not reach the same conclusion for workers in small ﬁrms.Furthermore, our results suggest that job movement and health are intimately related. Thisrelationship should be explored more in future research.Further research into the destination as well as the source of occupational change would beextremely helpful. Using our data, it would be possible to link occupational changes to changesin income, from which we can get a better understanding of why people move jobs, assumingthat income jumps indicate a choice to move jobs, and income declines indicate being forcedout of a job. This is left as a subject for future work.18Figure 1: Height by Occupationyitsn 4eD86201.41.51.6 1.7Height (in meters)Self EmploymentPublic Sector FirmsSmall FirmsNo Earned Income1.81.9Large Firms 19l ) ) ) ) )ta .2 .9 .9 .9 .7 .5 .6 .0 .0 .3o 2 6 9 7 4 4 1 2 9 71 1 2 2 5 4 2 3 3 1T ( ( ( ( (nI ) ) ) ) )d .2 .5 .2 .7 .8 .7 .3 .8 .7 .8e 4 7 1 8 5 4 3 2 5 6n 1 1 3 2 5 4 2 3 3 1( ( ( ( (emocraEoNbuPsLrotce ) ) ) ) )S .0 .8 .3 .3 .1 .7 .6 .2 .8 .12 7 5 3 7 0 9 7 5 8ic 1 1 5 3 8 3 4 3 5 1l ( ( ( ( (mri ) ) ) ) )F .4 .1 .7 .7 .6 .1 .0 .9 .9 .86 9 5 7 9 3 8 6 1 7e 1 1 4 2 7 3 3 3 4 1g ( ( ( ( (ra.sesehts enrm an ir ) ) ) ) ) pito lF .21 .73 .93 .73 .68 .25 .95 .01 .76 .56 ina la 1 (1 2 (2 5 (4 1 (3 3 (1 rep au mc Scsnoitaivedelpmasodnaocstsetep d rdy e at y dt lo ) ) ) ) ) ntse p .2 .3 .2 .36 .28 .45 .37 .62 .84 .69 tsam 01 15 22 2 4 4 1 2 3 1 ;y E ( ( ( ( ( s- nb lf a, e ese S mreg dl:reea1vbA ’()sevn% it()tsecahm% il()sgh% i()gand% llteeoagkndhw ltrrseeeaoupVa a a n e ee) r% a(T R M E R H20latoTemocnIdenraEoNrotceScilbuPsmriFegraLra se my rits Fa llp ae mth Sn ediyr oo lpllin lf-Eeo StmniyrujsseeudevitcanisyaD:2elbaT) ) )2 7 6 4 0 4.3 .4 .4 .0 .9 .90 0 3 23 1 30 9( ( () ) )2 7 9 01 09 .22.3 .4 .1 .0 0 3 16 .9 27( ( () ) )5 3 1 6 6 8.2 .4 .2 .9 .1 .50 0 7 44 2 89 7( ( () ) )7 5 1 1 3 0.2 .4 .0 .8 .8 .30 0 4 21 1 44 0( ( () ) )E-47 9 4 9 0 6) ) )E-49 0 1 6 7 1.3 .4 .8 .6 .0 .6.3 .5 .6 .6 .0 .80 0 1 3 5 4( ( (E-40 0 1 2 4 2( ( (E-4) ) )2 7 5 92 09 .48.3 .4 .8 .0 0 2 13 .8 22( ( () ) )0 6 3 8 1 8.3 .4 .0 .3 .2 .00 0 3 16 1 20 9( ( () ) )E-45 4 5 8 5 4.2 .4 .9 .9 .7 .20 0 0 1 3 2( ( (E-4) ) )6 8 8 7 4 8.3 .4 .9 .5 2 .30 0 2 14 .8 23( ( (.sesehtner) ) ) a5 4 2 8 8 36 p.2 .4 .7 .3 .7 . n0 0 1 6 6 11 i( (E-4( eradra) ) ) d7 8 8 0 2 8 n.3 .4 .4 .0 5 .3 ta0 0 3 16 .9 25 s(( ( ;snaesnoitaivedmelpmaseratsaeltah hE-5it ss s s it ss s ss s s s pw e e e w e e e evea ion illn llin liln vea ion illn llin llin rsef f f f uo o o o la600Wtrroop foayd s s 500Wtrroop foayd s sy y y ya a a aE-52 P 1 D D 2 P 1 D DE-5V0d> ef ti rotsael0t> afi21Table 3: Variable DeﬁnitionsVariableMaleAgeEducationHeightNHISEmpl. small ﬁrmEmpl. big ﬁrmEmpl. publicRaven scoreMath scoreEnglish scoreReading scoreHealth knowledgeln(hours)Earned IncomeChildrenMarriedHH headln(wage)Description=1 if male.age in years.years of education, not including vocational training.height in meters.community-level measure of the percent of individuals who have registeredfor an NHIS card (from 0 to 1).=1 if employed in ﬁrm with ≤10 employees.=1 if employed in ﬁrm with more than 10 employees.=1 if employed in the public sector.correct answers as a fraction of the total on the Raven’s test.correct answers as a fraction of the total on the mathematics test.correct answers as a fraction of the total on the English test.correct answers as a fraction of the total on the reading test.correct answers as a fraction of the total on the health knowledge test.natural log of hours of work per week.=1 if non-zero wages.individual’s number of children.=1 if married.=1 if head of household.natural log of real monthly earnings in Ghanaian cedis for all wage earners(both the self-employed and those in the market sector).22Table 4: Summary Statistics for Regression SampleMaleAge (years)<ref></ref>g ﬁrmEmployed in public sectorNo earned incomeNValues reported are sample means;
