Following an eventful history since 1918, Czechoslovakiachanged in 1948 from a liberal democracy into a Communist regime. This had significant consequences for journalists andtheir national union and also for the International Organization of Journalists (IOJ), which had just established its head-quarters in Prague. The second historical event to shake the political system was the “Prague Spring” of 1968 and itsaftermath among journalists and their unions. The third landmark was the “Velvet Revolution” of 1989, which played asignificant part in the fall of Communism in Central and Eastern Europe and led to the closing of the old Union of Journalistsin 1990, followed by the founding of a new Syndicate which refused to serve as the host of the IOJ. This led to a gradualdisintegration and the closing down of what in the 1980s was the world’s largest non-governmental organization in themedia field.KeywordsCold War; communism; Czechoslovakia; International Organization of Journalists; journalism; union of journalistsIssueThis article is part of the issue “Histories of Collaboration and Dissent: Journalists’ Associations Squeezed by Political SystemChanges”, edited by Epp Lauk (University of Jyväskylä, Finland) and Kaarle Nordenstreng (University of Tampere, Finland).© 2017 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).

IntroductionThe starting point of this article is a story about the riseand fall of the IOJ—an international non-governmentalorganization of journalists based in Czechoslovakia,which had become an icon of the changing political land-scape of the world since 1946. The same story has beentold in an anthology of the history of the internationalmovement of journalists (Nordernstreng, Björk, Beyers-dorf, Høyer, & Lauk, 2016) and also in a monograph onthe IOJ (Nordenstreng, in press), but this was done with-out covering the broader context of the political historyof Czechoslovakia. The present review aims to fill the gapby first describing the key political turns in the history ofCzechoslovakia since World War I (Emmert, 2012).2. Political History of Czechoslovakia from 1918 to the1990s2.1. Four Periods between 1918 and 1948If we wish to understand the events which took place inpost-war Czechoslovakia, particularly in February 1948,when the Communist Party took over political power inthe country, we need to go back another thirty years.Czechoslovak history divides the period between 1918and 1948 into four main phases: the First Republic,the Second Republic, the Protectorate of Bohemia andMoravia and the Third Republic.The period of the First Republic is defined by twodates: 28 October 1918 (birth of independent Czechoslo-Media and Communication, 2017, Volume 5, Issue 3, Pages 95–10295vakia) and 30 September 1938 (signing of the MunichAgreement). In 1918 Czechoslovakia ceased to be part ofthe Austro–Hungarian Empire and became an indepen-dent republic with a democratic polity based on the Con-stitution. The country consisted of Bohemia, Moravia,Silesia, Slovakia and Subcarpathian Ruthenia. The Repub-lic was characteristically multi-ethnic and there were ini-tially large social, cultural and economic differences be-tween its individual regions. The internal unity of thenew state was challenged by the German ethnic minor-ity living in the border regions and wishing to becomepart of Germany, and the leftist labour movement, whichfounded the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (hence-forward the CPC) in May 1924. In the short term, how-ever, Czechoslovakia became a mature democratic re-public with a broad spectrum of political parties, andthe republic advanced in leaps and bounds in the fieldsof industry, trade, education and lifestyle. An extensiveprint media developed, the press being primarily parti-san, with a minority non-party press, tabloids and mag-azines, and the new media of radio and film were evolv-ing. Partial censorship existed and was carried out by theMinistry of Interior. Publishers had to submit mandatorycopies to district authorities or police headquarters, whohad the right to withhold prints prior to their release, toallow the issue only after a change or deletion of thetext or even confiscate the press (Končelík, Večeřa, &Orság, 2010). Nevertheless, cultural openness and toler-ance prevailed.The next period of the Second Republic began withthe signing of the Munich Agreement and the creation ofthe Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia on 30 Septem-ber 1938, lasting only until 15 March 1939. In this shortperiod, Czechoslovakia lost extensive border territories,Slovakia, and Subcarpathian Ruthenia. Politically, thecountry was subverted and the democratic principles ofthe First Republic, organization and freedom were de-stroyed. The Party of National Unity and the NationalLabour Party became the only two political parties.1Czechoslovak society perceived the Munich Agreementas a defeat which threw it into disillusion and moral crisis.These facts were also reflected in the media, with the dis-appearance of many periodicals and the intensificationof censorship.The third period between 16 March 1939 and 8May 1945 is known as the Protectorate of Bohemia andMoravia. The territory of the Protectorate included prac-tically all of the present-day Czech Republic, so Nazi Ger-many effectively occupied the entire country. The Czechpresident formally remained Head of the Protectorate,along with the Protectorate’s Czech government. Never-theless, the real power—with a brutal and totalitarianNazi regime—was held by a Reichsprotektor, who washand-picked by Adolf Hitler. This means that the Ger-mans had the Czech economy, industrial and agriculturalproduction, transport, education and culture fully undertheir control. The media were controlled by a Nazi infor-mation monopoly and subjected to severe censorship. Inaddition to the official media, illegal and media in-exilewere quickly established. The Czech population was sub-jected to a programme of Germanisation. Citizens of Jew-ish origin were deprived of their civil rights, persecutedin various ways, including the confiscation of property,and, starting in the autumn of 1941, were gradually phys-ically eliminated.Understandably, the Czech people did not accept theoccupation and resistance to it soon emerged. Theseactivities culminated in the assassination of the Reich-sprotektor. Meanwhile, the government-in-exile, led byEdvard Beneš, was established in London. Any expres-sions of anti-Nazi feeling were brutally suppressed by theoccupiers—punished by death, imprisonment or deten-tion in a concentration camp. Nevertheless, a numberof Czechs cooperated—collaborated—with the occupy-ing regime during the Protectorate. However, the major-ity of the population continued to oppose the Germans(Emmert, 2012) and, on 5 May 1945, resistance to theoccupation developed into an armed Prague uprising,2which ended on 8 May 1945 with the defeat of Germany.Finally, the fourth period from the May 1945 to Febru-ary 1948 is called the Third Republic. The basic documentestablishing the direction of Czechoslovakia after WorldWar II was the Košice Government Programme,3 whichintroduced the first post-war Czechoslovak Governmentheavily influenced by the USSR—the winner of the war.It was drawn up by the Moscow-based leadership of theCPC and proclaimed the confiscation of property belong-ing to Germans, Hungarians and Czech collaborators, thepunishment of collaborators, an equal relationship be-tween Czechs and Slovaks, the establishment of NationalCommittees4 and fundamental changes in the economicand social spheres, as well as the banning of the activi-ties of right-wing political parties. Accordingly, it not onlydealt with the punishment of war criminals, traitors andcollaborators, but also led to the rejection of the FirstRepublic’s political and economic system. Some Czech1 The political system of the Second Republic was simplified and there were only two main political parties: (1) an “official” right-wing Party of Na-tional Unity (Strana národní jednoty) gathering together the Republican Party of Farmers and Peasants, Czechoslovak Traders’ Party, National FascistCommunity, Czechoslovak Christian Social Party, National People’s Party, and (2) in “loyal” opposition, the left-wing National Labour Party (Národnístrana práce).2 The Prague uprising was an attempt by the Czech resistance to liberate the city of Prague from German occupying forces. It lasted from 5 May until 8May 1945, ending in a ceasefire between the Czech resistance and the German army, which decided to leave Prague on the same day. Next morning,the Red Army entered the nearly liberated city.3 See an educational portal for teachers, students and pupils available on the internet http://www.moderni-dejiny.cz/clanek/kosicky-vladni-program-5-4-19454 The National Committee (1945–1990; NC) was a part of the Czechoslovak state administration with formally elected bodies. The NC was divided ac-cording to the place of operation—from the top level of the country, within regions, districts and towns to municipalities. It performed as an “extendedarm” of the CPC for the economy and whole society.Media and Communication, 2017, Volume 5, Issue 3, Pages 95–10296historians view this part of Czechoslovak history in twoways: either as a short period of freedom squeezed in be-tween two dictatorships (Nazi and Communist) or as thetrappings of democracy leading to the Communist snare.(Drápala, 2000)In May 1946 Czechoslovakia held its first post-warparliamentary elections. A limited number of parties par-ticipated in the election. While the CPC won in the Czechlands with more than 40% of the vote, the DemocraticParty won in Slovakia with 60% of the vote. In June 1946,the pre-war leader Edvard Beneš was confirmed as Presi-dent of the Republic, and he appointed a government ledby CPC chairman Klement Gottwald. In October 1946, theCzechoslovak National Assembly approved an economicplan for the reconstruction of post-war Czechoslovakia.In 1947 the USSR began to create the Eastern blocby arrangements such as a peace treaty concluded withHungary and a friendship and mutual assistance treatyconcluded with Poland. At this time Czechoslovakia fol-lowed Moscow’s “advice” to withdraw from the MarshallPlan and to sign a trade agreement with the USSR.In the post-war atmosphere the liberalism and hu-manism which characterized the First Republic were per-ceived by the majority of society as the root of all evil,which was to blame for the hardships of war, humandegradation and the total collapse of modern society.The central theme of the time was socialism, which wasalso complemented by nationalism and Slavonic patrio-tism. In May 1945 the Ministry of Information issued aDecree forbidding the publication of any printed mate-rial, with the exception of selected dailies issued by Na-tional Front parties. Further permission to publish wasonly granted to those organisations which could provethat this was in the public interest.In the Third Republic immediately after the war, theCzechoslovak press was made up of three ideological-political types: (1) the Communist press and periodi-cals with Communist sympathies, (2) a democratic left-wing press and (3) the non-Socialist press. Censorshipwas not exercised, although the press laws dating backto the First Republic provided for it. But the situationchanged in autumn 1947, when the Communists beganto perceive censorship as an indispensable instrumentof power. In December 1947 the Ministry of Informa-tion created the Surveillance Department, which aimedto monitor objectionable texts dealing with the nationaleconomic plan, incitement against the Slavonic peoplesas well as deviation from the basic line in domestic andforeign policy and matters connected to the defence ofthe state (Kaplan & Tomášek, 1994).2.2. The Communist Takeover of 1948A dramatic government crisis started in Prague on 13February 1948 when personnel changes in favour of theCommunists were made in the National Security Corps.The response to the ever-increasing influence of the CPCwas the resignation of the non-Communist ministers, 12members of a 26-member government, on 20 February1948. The CPC and groups sympathetic to it within indi-vidual parties began to establish the National Front Ac-tion Committees (NFAC), whose aim was to “cleanse” thegovernment and public life of all non-Communist politi-cal forces. Two days later, the People’s Militia also cameinto being, armed units consisting mostly of workers di-rectly controlled by the CPC. Their main aim was thedefence of industrial enterprises and the intimidationof their political (anti-Socialist) opponents. The conflictcontinued on 24 February 1948 with an hour-long gen-eral strike in support of the CPC’s requirements, and es-calated on 25 February, when President Edvard Benešagreed to make changes in the government as suggestedby Klement Gottwald.This is how Communists came to power in Czechoslo-vakia—widely known as the “Communist coup”. In earlyMay, a new Constitution was approved, and the defini-tive influence of the CPC in the country was formally con-firmed on 30 May 1948 by the parliamentary elections.All the parties stood on a single list of candidates led bythe CPC and 89% of the electorate voted for them. 70%of members of the National Assembly were Communists,and the remaining members from other parties were pro-Communist. Finally, in June 1948, Klement Gottwald be-came the new President.At this stage the CPC brought society under totali-tarian control. The economy was based on the princi-ple of central planning, and companies with more than50 employees were nationalised. Under pressure fromMoscow, the CPC’s Central Committee began to take ahard line against any criticism of the Communist systemor in favour of liberal thinking. There were a number offabricated political trials, forced labour camps were cre-ated and the strict supervision of the censor covered notonly the field of culture, including the press, but also thelife of the Church. A counter-reaction to the situation wasa wave of emigration, during which a large communityof post-February 1948 emigrants founded publicationsin exile. May 1951 saw the launch of Radio Free Europewith regular broadcasts from Munich.After February 1948 the CPC began to introduce cen-sorship which would apply not only to the periodical andnon-periodical press, radio, film and the early days of TV,but also to exhibitions, libraries, local records, posters,advertising leaflets, badges, labels and the like. In thisway, the media became closely intertwined with the sys-tem of political power, while the limits of journalisticfreedom were defined by the National Front and self-censorship (Končelík et al., 2010). The system of censor-ship policed the flow of information both at home andabroad. There was a ban on importing foreign newspa-pers and magazines, press agencies were shut down, aswere cultural centres and information offices with theirheadquarters in the West. The state security routinelymonitored correspondence sent from and to capitalistcountries and so on. In the coming years, everything thatdid not suit the official ideas of the socialist press grad-Media and Communication, 2017, Volume 5, Issue 3, Pages 95–10297ually disappeared from the newspapers, while the cen-sor intervened not only in matters of content, but alsoof form, and tried to influence production, print run andscope. In this way, the Communist regime gained a totalinformation monopoly.However, in the early 1950s, a more moderate cul-tural policy was promoted. The reason for this was notonly the fact the Soviet ideas of socialist art had provedproblematic, but it was also a response to the growingconflict within the CPC itself (Knapík, 2006). The conceptof the “new course”5 opened up the possibility of liberal-isation in Czechoslovakia’s cultural sphere between 1953and 1956. After the death of Josef Stalin in 1953 andthe criticism by Nikita Khrushchev in 1956, the regimebegan to look more kindly on some still-rejected person-alities, less strict aesthetic criteria appeared, and evensome channels for contact with the West were intro-duced. A new artistic generation began to take shapethat did not feel itself as bound to the dogmatic doctrinesof the late 1940s and early 1950s. While the Cold Warcontinued as an overall frame, it was possible to hopefor the promotion of liberalistic tendencies.The pressure for reforms in the CPC and other as-pects of everyday life increased after the mid-1960s. Asthe reform supporters became increasingly recognizedin the CPC and public life, the liberal orientation in thecountry and in the CPC gradually won the support of themajority for a revised form of Communism.2.3. The Prague Spring of 1968In 1968 the world was in turmoil, with the war in Viet-nam, the civil rights movement in the USA and studentunrest throughout Europe, especially in France. It was aunique year in post-war history, as 1848 had been a hun-dred years earlier. And the “Prague Spring” became itsfocal point.For a short period, from January to August 1968,there was a huge development among politicians, in-tellectuals, students and ordinary public life spheres inCzechoslovakia. The social and political criticism of thesystem had been gradual and fundamental and was re-flected in economy, central management, culture andmedia. At the end of 1967 a crisis in the CPC itselfdeepened and the party split into two groups: (1) con-servatives, represented by Antonín Novotný, Czechoslo-vak president and CPC first secretary, and (2) reformCommunists, who wanted to democratize the old poli-tics. In January 1968 the big break happened, when An-tonín Novotný was removed as first secretary of the CPCand replaced by Alexander Dubček, a reform Communistfrom Slovakia.The motto of Dubček´s new political programme6was “Socialism with a human face”. Although the Cze-choslovak economy should still be based on state orco-operative ownership, non-Communist parties, broadpublic community and free elections should also be in-volved in political power. Admission to leading positionsand universities should no longer be contingent uponCPC membership. The reforms also abolished censorshipand an informal alliance developed between Dubček´sleadership and journalists. Indeed, the media played acrucial role in the Prague Spring (Končelík et al., 2010).Freedom of speech flourished and different associationslike the scout movement were restored. The PragueSpring changes were supported throughout society andhad a considerable international response.However, the Soviet Communist Party, together withits sister parties in other Socialist countries, were afraidof this revival process, and this fear led to the occupa-tion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact military forceson 21 August 1968. From September 1968 the so-calledMoscow Protocol was implemented in Czechoslovakia.The Czechoslovak population of course protested againstthe occupation. The most radical act against the restora-tion of the Communist dictatorship was that of JanPalach, a student of the Charles University, who burnedhimself to death on 16 January 1969 at the Prague’sWenceslas Square. In April 1969 Gustáv Husák becamethe first secretary of the Communist Party. AlexanderDubček and his closest associates were soon removedfrom public life and replaced by Soviet puppets. Every-one who participated in the Prague Spring or disagreedwith the occupation was punished. Censorship was rein-stated and thousands of books and films were banned.Many Czechs and Slovaks left the country.The Prague Spring was consequently brought to adrastic end and replaced by a sweeping political pro-cess called “Normalization” lasting for 20 years. OfficiallyCzechoslovakia was a faithful member of the Easternbloc, and the CPC bureaucratic apparatus was severelycontrolling all aspects of life. Yet under the surfacethere existed an underground culture, intellectual dis-sent, samizdat and an exile literature. The CPC bureau-cratic apparatus could no longer effectively control allareas of society. The most significant manifestation ofthe anti-Communist resistance was the publication ofCharter 77 with its civil movement established in January1977, led by writer and later Czechoslovak President Vá-clav Havel and the university professor Jan Patočka.5 The “new course” (nový kurs) was proclaimed by the leadership of the CPC after the deaths of Stalin and Gottwald in 1953. Its result was a more be-nign approach to the middle classes; forced collectivisation in villages was temporarily halted, auxiliary technical battalions were disbanded, politicaltrials were discontinued and the process of revising their outcomes began, etc. See http://www.edejiny.cz/obdobi-destalinizace-v-ceskoslovensku-1953-%E2%80%93-19606 There were two main documents determining the Prague Spring: (1) Dubček´s CPC Action programme posted on 5 April 1968, related to the politicsand reform steps of CPC, and (2) the “Two thousand words” document written by Ludvík Vaculík together with leading Czech scientists, published on27 July 1968. It was about the activation of the Czechoslovak public against the ever-evident pressure of the Soviet leadership against the reforms inthe country. The manifesto was signed by hundreds of public figures and more than 120,000 citizens, which led to the persecution of many people inthe period of normalization in the 1970s.Media and Communication, 2017, Volume 5, Issue 3, Pages 95–102982.4. The Velvet Revolution of 1989The resistance to the Communist regime began to in-crease in the late 1980s, in connection with Mikhail Gor-bachev’s rise to power in the USSR and policy of per-estroika and glasnost. The CPC claimed to agree withthis Soviet reform policy, but this was rather lip service.Demonstrations of disagreement with the totalitarianregime proliferated, but were also severely suppressedby the security forces.The most important actions took place on (1) 28 Oc-tober 1988, the 70th anniversary of the founding of theCzechoslovak Republic, (2) 16 January 1989, the 20th an-niversary of Jan Palach’s suicide, and (3) 29 June 1989,the publication of “A Few Sentences”, a call by dissidentleaders for the release of political prisoners, open andfree discussion, including thorny historical issues, andthe end of censorship.7 The crucial event which precip-itated the Velvet Revolution, happened on 17 Novem-ber 1989 in the centre of Prague, when security po-lice blocked and violently broke up a student processionto commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Interna-tional Day of Students. The fundamental response to thisarmed intervention was the founding of the Civic Forum,headed by Václav Havel, to begin a dialogue with theCommunist leaders. Massive demonstrations took placethroughout Czechoslovakia in support of the Civic Forum,and university students went on strike.On 24 November 1989, the CPC’s secretary gen-eral Ladislav Adamec and his entire central commit-tee withdrew. The name of the state was changed toCzecho-Slovak Federative Republic and the head of theFederal assembly became Prague Spring leader Alexan-der Dubček. On 29 December 1989 Václav Havel waselected as the new President. During 1990 Czechoslo-vakia became a federal republic and the transformationof Czechoslovak society and its economic, social andpolitical life from Communist totalitarianism to liberaldemocracy could begin after long 40 years.3. The Journalists and Their Union 1946–1990After World War II, there were naturally significantchanges in journalism as a profession. Before 1946 jour-nalists were represented by the protectorate NationalUnion of Journalists (NUJ; see more on this in Cebe, 2017,in this issue). The Czech Journalists’ Union (hencefor-ward the CJU)8 came into being at a general meeting inMarch 1946. On that occasion it was also agreed that pro-fessional matters should in future fall under the remit ofthe Revolutionary Trade Union Movement.9 The CJU rep-resented a community of altogether about 800 journal-ists (Cebe, 2012). In 1947, following the Act on the Statusof Editors and Journalists’ Unions, two journalists’ unionswere formed, the Czech union (formerly CJU) and the Slo-vak union, while above them an umbrella organizationwas established, the Central Union of Czechoslovak Jour-nalists (CUCSJ). In May 1947 the government passed theAct on the Status of Editors and Journalists’ Unions.10 Infact, the CJU and CUCSJ were more a tool of the regimethan a provider of benefits to journalists.On this basis, the practice of journalism was tiedto compulsory membership of the CJU, which had direconsequences for many journalists in the post-Februarycleansing. After February 1948, there were dynamic po-litical and social changes. Even in the CJU action com-mittees were founded and only those journalists whowere willing to work with the newly-established regimeremained members of the Union. The others were ex-cluded from their professional organization and therebylost all chances of working in the media. The NFAC forcedmore than one hundred experienced journalists to leaveand consequently affected the Czechoslovak media fordecades. (Cebe, 2012)The new Communist Constitution of May 1948 hadtwo main consequences for journalists and their union.Firstly, although the new Constitution guaranteed free-dom of expression and prohibited censorship, the CPCconsistently monitored all media production, making in-dependent media in practice impossible. The journalistbecame a mere instrument lacking any autonomy, pro-viding information on only politically-approved interpre-tations of events. The economy was only to be portrayedas flourishing, accompanied by the people’s efforts tobuild it up. In the same way, both sports and scientificachievements were to be ascribed to the merits of thenew Communist regime. The most significant instrumentfor controlling the media was, of course, the staffing pol-icy, meaning that journalists were in constant fear of los-ing their jobs. (Končelík et al., 2010)Secondly, a new, integrated Union of CzechoslovakJournalists (UCSJ; 1948–1972), headquartered in Prague,was founded and, within it, the National Union of SlovakJournalists, headquartered in Bratislava. The state, ratherthan the UCSJ, made the decisions regarding its focus,organizational structure or the exercise of the journal-7 For more, see http://old.ustrcr.cz/en/milestones-in-recent-czech-history-1938-19898 The succession of changing union formations from 1946 to 1990: 1946–1947: Czech Journalists Union (CJU); 1947–1948: Czech Journalists Union(CJU), Slovak Journalists Union (SJU), Central Union of Czechoslovak Journalists (CUCSJ); 1948–1968: National Union of Czechoslovak Journalists (UCSJ),Union of Slovak Journalists (USJ); 1968–1972: Unions of Czech (UCJ) and Slovak (USJ) Journalists, Headquarters; 1972–1990: Czech Union of Journalists(CUJ), Slovak Union of Journalists (SUJ), National Czechoslovak Union of Journalists (NCSUJ), 1990: The Syndicate of Journalists of the Czech Republic.(Ševčíková, 2015).9 The Revolutionary Trade Union Movement Act was passed on 16 May 1946. In 1947, the decision was taken that the CJU should also fulfil the functionof a trade union. Divisional membership was voluntary; however, the CJU pointed out to its members that the CJU would not represent them in profes-sional issues if they were not members of the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement. From 1 January 1948, the Agreement on the Entry of Journalistsinto the Revolutionary Trade Union Movement came into force and after that date, the majority of journalists joined a trade union.10 Act No. 101/1974 Coll. It stipulated, among other things, who could become an editor, laid down the rights and responsibilities of editors, includingthe right of the Union to take disciplinary action against its members.Media and Communication, 2017, Volume 5, Issue 3, Pages 95–10299ism as a profession and membership, meaning that theorganization toed the Communist party line throughoutits existence.From 1948, the CJU and UCSJ also served as the gate-way to international organizations, above all to the IOJ. InJuly 1968, following the events of the Prague Spring, theUCSJ held a landmark congress. A new statute and sev-eral resolutions were adopted in support of a new modelof Socialism (“with a human face”), democracy and free-dom of the press, speech and information. The formerUCSJ was abolished and new Unions of Czech (UCJ, 1968–1972) and Slovak (USJ, 1968–1972) Journalists, includ-ing an umbrella organization (Headquarters, 1968–1972)were formed.The new organizational model continued until Au-gust 1968. Both the Headquarters and UCJ were underthe control of the Commission for the Preparation of theII Congress of the UCJ, which soon overturned all the de-cisions of the previous leadership and set up a cleansingcommission on the basis of which 479 journalists wereexcluded from the Union and therefore also from theirprofession between September 1968 to March 1970, fol-lowed in 1972 by another 800 journalists.As of 1971 the whole union had a complete overhaulin the line of normalization. In May 1972 a congress wasconvened at which the Czech Union of Journalists (CUJ,1972–1990), the Slovak Union of Journalists (SUJ, 1972–1990) and the National Czechoslovak Union of Journalists(NCSUJ, 1972–1990) were established.The big breakup of the NCSUJ took place at the turnof 1989 and 1990, due to the political events of the Vel-vet Revolution and the end of the Communist regime. Im-mediately after 17 November 1989, a new managementof the CUJ, including the Bureau and its secretariat, waselected. At the same time, the new Bureau of the CUJconvened a general meeting on 16 December 1989, atwhich it was decided to create a new journalist organiza-tion, with the form of a syndicate. The old Union (CUJ)was dissolved at the extraordinary congress of the CUJon 6 January 1990, and the successor organization be-came the Syndicate of Journalists of the Czech Republic,as a voluntary, independent, non-political, professionallyunited union of Czech and Moravian journalists. (Prouza,1990) The new Syndicate refused to join the IOJ and in-stead became member of the IFJ.4. The IOJ from 1946 to the 1990s4.1. Founding and SplitThe IOJ was founded at the International Congress ofJournalists in June 1946 in Copenhagen, the capital ofDenmark, which had only recently been liberated fromNazi occupation. The congress was attended by 165 dele-gates11 from 21 countries. The post-war atmosphere wasone of joy and optimism. In Czechoslovakia, this camejust after the post-war parliamentary elections, whichbrought the Communists to power as the leading polit-ical force (for details of the first IOJ congresses, see Nor-denstreng & Kubka, 1988).The provisional constitution was finalised and ap-proved at the second IOJ congress held in Prague in June1947 and attended by 208 delegates from 21 countries,the UN and UNESCO. The CJU, led by Jiří Hronek, was re-sponsible for organizing the congress and its patron wasPresident Edvard Beneš, who spoke at the opening cere-mony, as did Jan Masaryk (Czechoslovak Minister of For-eign Affairs) and Klement Gottwald (Prime Minister andCPC Chairman).The same positive atmosphere prevailed at the sec-ond congress in Prague as one year earlier in Copen-hagen, although some tension about the impending di-vision of the world could already be sensed. While thehost union was in the middle of structural and politi-cal changes, the congress went smoothly in impressivesettings. The constitutional statutes and principal reso-lutions were approved unanimously, likewise the leader-ship elected, with Archibald Kenyon of the UK continuingas President and Vice Presidents coming from the USA,USSR, France and Denmark. Hronek was unanimouslyelected to the combined office of Secretary General andTreasurer. But the site of the headquarters had to be putto a vote, the majority supporting Prague, while a minor-ity led by British and Americans voted for London.In less than a year after the Prague congress, by early1948, the Cold War had broken out and a wave of po-litical system changes in Central and Eastern Europe ledto a division of Europe into East and West, separated bythe “iron curtain”. The IOJ was part of this battleground,becoming embroiled in Cold-War politics (Nordenstrenget al., 2016). The post-war unity of professional journal-ists was quickly replaced by distrust and antagonism be-tween the capitalist West and the socialist East, exac-erbated by political mobilization in both camps. Effortsby the Czech Secretary General Hronek and the BritishPresident Kenyon to hold the IOJ together were over-ruled by orders from Cold-War strategists in London andWashington, on the one hand, and the Soviet CommunistParty hardliners in Moscow, on the other (Nordenstreng,in press).The IOJ headquarters in Prague chose the Sovietside of the political divide as swiftly as the CzechoslovakUnion was moved to the Socialist camp. These two pro-cesses were parallel and obviously reflections of a com-mon overall shift in global relations of power.In 1948–1949 the IOJ lost its West European andNorth American members, except for left-leaning groupsof journalists there (mainly in France and Finland). Thethird IOJ congress in Helsinki in 1950 confirmed thechange by changing the statutes in line with the Commu-nist approach, the bulk of the membership in the Social-ist countries of Central–Eastern Europe and newly inde-11 The Czechoslovak delegation to the Congress was represented by CJU Chairman Otakar Wünsch, Jiří Hronek, K. F. Zieris (CJU secretary) and EmilŠtefan (USJ).Media and Communication, 2017, Volume 5, Issue 3, Pages 95–102100pendent countries of the Third World, including Commu-nist China.The IOJ had become one of the “democratic inter-national organizations” closely associated with the USSR.The Western journalists’ associations established a newInternational Federation of Journalists (IFJ) in Brussels in1952—as part of the “Free West” countering the “Com-munist East”. The Cold War politics led to the loss of theIOJ’s affiliation with the UN and UNESCO, but it gainednew members in the developing countries of Africa, Asiaand Latin America. In 1966, its membership amountedto 130,000 journalists in 108 countries, while the IFJ had55,000 members in 31 countries.4.2. The Prague SpringThe IOJ continued to grow despite turmoil in its politicalenvironment caused by the Prague Spring in 1968 and itsaftermath. The IOJ had its premises in the building of theCzechoslovak Union UCSJ, and in August 1968 the wholebuilding was occupied by Warsaw pact forces. However,the IOJ was soon allowed to return to its premises andcontinued more or less as before, while the reformistCzechoslovak Union was effectively replaced by a newCJU (see above).Unlike in 1948, the IOJ did not dramatically follow thesystem change implemented in the national union. Actu-ally the IOJ activities, including the monthly publicationThe Democratic Journalist, had since the 1950s remainedquite true to the “Moscow line”, with no symptoms ofthe Prague Spring. By the 1970s the IOJ was firmly con-solidated on the basis established in the late 1940s, nowincreasingly dominated by an “anti-imperialist” orienta-tion reflecting the concerns of the developing countriesand meeting the Soviet interests. The changing climateof international relations was also instrumental to rein-stating IOJ’s affiliation with the UN and UNESCO.Financial support for more and more activitiesaround the world came not only from the nominal mem-bership fees but from public “solidarity lotteries” inEast European Socialist countries. Moreover, a peculiarsource for financing was invented by new Secretary Gen-eral Jiří Kubka together with the Hungarian TreasurerNorbert Siklósi: the IOJ was permitted, with the blessingof the Communist Party, to establish commercial com-panies in translation and conference services, publish-ing, etc. This privilege made the IOJ quite rich, facili-tating a large secretariat with a publishing house, train-ing schools in European Socialist counties, regional cen-tres on all developing continents and large conferencesaround the world.The heyday of the IOJ was in the late 1980s, whenits membership reached 300,000. By this time its polit-ical line had become much more open and broad, par-ticularly by its active engagement in East–West détentefrom 1973 on, leading gradually to contacts and evencooperation with the IFJ in the 1980s (Nordenstrenget al., 2016).4.3. The Velvet RevolutionThe Cold War world order began to crumble in late1989, when first the Berlin Wall fell and then Prague wasshaken by the Velvet Revolution, followed by the fall ofCommunism in Eastern Europe. Global geopolitics wassuddenly changed and the IOJ was challenged: its head-quarters and operations in Prague came under sharp at-tack from the rising political forces in Czechoslovakia,and its local member Union—the legal base for its seatin Prague—was closed down and replaced by a new Syn-dicate which did not want to affiliate with the IOJ butjoined the IFJ. Moreover, other strong member unionsin former Socialist countries, notably the USSR, began tolose political and material ground. The IOJ’s financial re-sources were rapidly dwindling and activities in training,publication, etc. were gradually discontinued.Nevertheless, in 1991 the IOJ held its 11th congressin Harare in fairly good shape, but by its 12th congress inAmman in 1995 it was crippled by shrinking finances andquarrelling leadership. After this, member unions one af-ter another decided to join the IFJ, while most of themalso remained nominal members of the IOJ. By the endof the 1990s the IOJ had in fact disappeared from thescene, whereas the IFJ had grown into an organizationalso representing the bulk of the earlier IOJ membership.Finally, in 2016, the last two IOJ presidents pronouncedthe IOJ effectively dead (Nordenstreng, in press).5. ConclusionIn summary: (1) the system change in 1948 from lib-eral democracy to Communism in Czechoslovakia imme-diately involved journalists with their national associa-tion, and the IOJ followed suit driven by the same devel-opments among all the Soviet-dominated Eastern Euro-pean member associations, while the Western memberswithdrew without an organizational fight; (2) the systeminstability of 1968 with an attempt to liberalize Commu-nism hit the national association hard but did not extendto the IOJ, which continued largely unchanged; (3) thesystem change in 1989 caused an immediate upheaval inthe national association and the gradual disintegrationof the IOJ, again as a result of changes throughout theSoviet block—a reverse process of 1948.The story of Czechoslovak journalist organizationsand the IOJ adds further evidence to the overall lessonpresented in Nordenstreng et al. (2016, p. 180): inter-national journalists’ associations are invariably bound bytheir political environments and to believe that journal-ists and their associations can ever be completely apolit-ical is a naïve illusion. However, the international move-ment is not deterministically driven by politics alone;it is also driven by professional interests with more orless autonomy.This article has mostly concerned the political historyof Czechoslovakia, which already suggests another gen-eral conclusion: in order to understand the relationshipMedia and Communication, 2017, Volume 5, Issue 3, Pages 95–102101which the media and journalists, including their associa-tions, have to political system changes, it is vital to havea profound knowledge of the history of the country inquestion. All too often are changes in media and journal-ists studied with a superficial understanding of the his-torical context.AcknowledgmentsThe authors wish to thank Isabel Stainsby and VirginiaMattila for their assistance in checking the English ofthis article.Conflict of InterestsThe authors declare no conflict of interests.References<ref>Cebe, J.
