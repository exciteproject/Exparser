The study highlights common practical problems faced by students and instructors inimplementing active learning in higher education and further identifies a set of individual prac-tices being used worldwide to overcome the obstacles. Expectations and responsibilities of stu-dents and instructors are also specified to enhance the efficiency of active learning environment.The paper also traces the importance of student and instructor rapport for a successful learningenvironment.Keywords: Active learning, higher education, problem based learning.1. IntroductionCan a person expect to get a car driving license just by attending the theoretical classes? Let ushypothetically assume the person manages to get a license, but will he be able to drive the car? No.To be a perfect car driver a person has to and does take real life driving classes. He develops newskills by actually driving along with the trainer.Higher education aims at an optimal blend of knowledge and skills. It provides a license to thestudent for driving successfully through the maze of what, when, why, who and how. Usually thenext step after higher education is a professional career. This is why role and importance of activelearning, and not passive learning (in which an instructor depends solely or predominantly onpassive lectures), is crucial throughout higher education.2. Active learningRoots of active learning can be traced to Confucius (551-479 BC), who stated, “I hear and Iforget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand”. Socrates (470-399 BC) had similar viewswhen he said that "I cannot teach anybody anything. I can only make them think".Dale (1969) established following relationships between level of involvement of learner and howmuch the learner remembers:- “We remember: 10% of what we read, 20% of what we hear, 30%of what we see, 50% of what we hear and see, 70% of what we say 90% of what we do”.Studies show that classroom attention-span of students varies from 15 to 25 minutes (Bligh, 1972as cited by Cashin, 1985). Meyers & Jones (1993) found that students’ classroom attention is poorfor 40% of the time and they retain 70% of the information during the first ten minutes and only20% of the information during the last ten minutes of a lecture. In a 1997 national survey in USA,of more than 250,000 freshmen at nearly 500 universities, 35.6% of the students said that theywere frequently bored in class. (Berk, 2003)All these facts stress on the need of active learning environment in particular when, feedbackfrom students has shown that passive lecture in higher education is not a preferred method oflearning. (Sander et al., 2000 as cited by Huxman, 2005)2.1 Active Learning: DefinedLiterature review highlighted the following characteristics of active learning.- Learning is enhanced by involving the student in activities and relationships, inside andoutside the classroom. (Astin, 1984)- “Lectures are not well suited to higher levels of learning: application, analysis, synthesis,influencing attitudes or values. Lecturing is best suited to the lower levels of knowledge andunderstanding.” (Cashin, 1985)- “Learning is not a spectator sport. Students do not learn much just by sitting in classeslistening to teachers, memorizing pre-packaged assignments, and spitting out answers. Theymust talk about what they are learning, write about it, relate it to past experiences and applyit to their daily lives.” (Chickering & Gamson, 1987)- Higher-order thinking through analysis, synthesis and evaluation is more important thanreading, writing and discussing. (Bonwell & Eison, 1991)- “Active learning involves providing opportunities for students to meaningfully talk and listen,write, read, and reflect on the content, ideas, issues and concerns of an academic subject.”(Meyers & Jones, 1993)- “Although humans appreciate the common and the familiar, and often resist change, thebrain seeks and reacts to innovative occurrences.” (Angelo, 1991 as cited by Forrest, 2004)- “In fact, rote learning (e.g., memorizing terminology) is frustrating because the brain resistsmeaningless stimuli.” (Forrest, 2004)Thus we may derive following definition:-Active learning involves designing, implementing, maintaining and promoting, within and outsideclassroom, environment for learning, through creating opportunities for active engagement withthe subject matter. It strives for higher-order thinking and in-depth comprehension of the learner.2.2 Active Learning: DrawbacksActive involvement and interaction of the students translate into loss of teaching time assubstantial classroom time is spent on multiple questioning and feedback sessions, (Lammers &Murphy, 2002 as cited by Huxman, 2005) especially while handling large classes.(Bonwell, C. &J. Eison, 1991) It results into lesser content coverage in the classroom. (Murray & Brightman,1996 as cited by Huxman, 2005). But the biggest roadblock is a creation of the instructor himselfand that is fear of failure, fear of loss of control due to enhanced classroom discussions, fear oflack of student participation, and fear of criticism of a new method. (Bonwell, C. & J. Eison, 1991)2.2.1 Handling drawbacks: Short LecturesAn analysis of research papers on higher education by Chilcoat (1989) found that, continuousrapid lecturing happens at a rate of 120 to 240 words per minute but most of the students canwrite down only 20 words per minute. Result is half cooked notes and poor understanding duringlecture time.A solution to the above problem can be found in a study conducted by Ruhl et al. (1987), in whichthe instructor paused for two minutes for three times during a lecture, and during these pausesstudents worked in pairs to re-discuss the topic discussed by the instructor and then reworked ontheir class notes to fill up the gaps left while taking down the notes during lecture. During thepauses students did not engage in discussion with the instructor. At the end of the lecture threeminutes were given to let the students write down their free recall. Results proved that shortlectures of 12 to 18 minutes followed by pauses for student interaction enhance students’ learning.Bonwell and Eison (1991), suggest to conduct guided lecture in which instructor lecturescontinuously for 20 to 30 minutes without the students taking notes and then allots five minutesfor free recall writing by the students followed by small groups of students discussing andanalyzing the topic.2.2.2 Handling drawbacks: Revised lecture information densityRussell et al. (1984) conducted a research on 123 medical students and divided them into threegroups with no significant difference in cumulative GPA’s. First group was exposed to highdensity lecture with 90% new content, second group was exposed to medium density lecture with70% new content and third to low density lecture with 50% new content. In each lecture theremaining time was spent on reinforcing the core ideas by actively involving the students and byrelating the content to prior experience. Tests after the lectures confirmed that learning andretention was higher with low density content.Fedler & Brent (1996) suggest to discuss only core, critical and difficult topics in class, to givebrief writing assignments to the students on the self covered topics and then to test the students onthose topics. Wilke (2003) conducted a research on 141 students in human physiology andfound that active learning improved students’ content achievement even when the content isreduced. Research had proved time and again that reduced lecture time and reduced lectureinformation density enhances learning.2.2.3 Handling drawbacks: Expectations and responsibilitiesLesser lecture time in the classroom and lower density content should not lead to lowerexpectations of the students or instructor. Chickering & Gamson (1987) suggest “expect more andyou will get more”. Seeler et al. (1994) suggests that active learning environment does not meanstructure less learning environment and it does not mean undermining the importance of theory.Active learning environment not only increases the opportunities for interaction and involvementbut also responsibilities. Following are some important expectations and responsibilities assuggested by Seeler et al. (1994).Students must be more aware and be ready to be responsible for their own professionaldevelopment. They must increase their level of involvement in the active learning environmentand focus on application of theory to real life practice. But this does not mean that the instructor isless responsible for active learning environment. Seeler et al. (1994) further suggest activelearning depends on the success of the instructor in helping the students successfully managetransition from passive style of learning to the new one. Instructor needs to understand ability ofthe student, develop new skills, be aware of practical applications of theory to design exercisesand assignments accordingly, adopt the role of facilitator and mentor. Instructor must rely onfeedback and make changes, if necessary.Stinson & Milter (1996) also highlight instructor’s skill development and student transition as twomajor pillars of active learning environment. They point out that the instructor needs to be anactive listener and a coach. So that he can encourage the students to take responsibility of theirown learning. This can be done effectively when the instructor gives continuous and promptfeedback to the students. (Chickering & Gamson 1987)2.2.4 Handling drawbacks: Student and instructor rapportConfucius believed in affection and empathy towards students (Huanyin, Y., 1999). Chickering &Gamson (1987) adviced instructors to “encourage contact between student and faculty”. Tiberius& Billson (Tiberius & Billson, 1991 as cited by Fleming, 2003) emphasized on need of a trustbased, open and cooperative relationship between an instructor and his students which is guided,not by control, but by mutual agreement.Active learning demands involvement. Involvement demands interaction. Fruitful interactiondemands rapport. But that does not mean that an instructor has to indulge in students’appeasement. He has to rather strive for a growth oriented relationship with sincerity and honesty.2.3 Co-operative active learningActive learning may be implemented through different routes. One of the popular routes iscooperative active learning. Students’ involvement amongst themselves is crucial for successfulactive learning environment. As Chickering & Gamson (1987) stated, “learning isn’t solo racerather it’s a team effort which depends on collaboration and cooperation amongst students.” Incooperative learning a class is divided into smaller groups to enhance understanding and learningof students through positive interdependence, individual accountability, continuous interaction,teamwork, to accomplish orderly thinking, problem solving, critical analysis and clear expression(Johnson et al. 1998).Imagine six stand alone desktop computers and now compare it with a group of six networkedcomputers. Which would give higher volume of fast information sharing and processing? Offcourse the networked group. Cooperative learning aims at developing a network of human brainsto achieve higher levels of learning, and to prevent this network from crashing the size of theteams is kept smaller. Student attendance is essential in a cooperative learning environment asabsence of one or few team member(s) might disturb the task accomplishment and create anegative impact on the team spirit. (McManus, 1996). Finlay and Faulkner (2005) conducted aproject in which self help reading groups of 3-5 students were formed. Each student had to read adifferent topic each week and then had to write one page synopsis which was later discussed withthe group. After the reading students asked questions among themselves. 73% of the studentsexpressed positive perception of the method. Boud et al. (1999) refer to a term “peer learning” inwhich students learn in a group without intervention of an instructor.Cooperative learning aims at self help in pursuit of knowledge. It may partially involve theinstructor or it may be practiced without instructor’s intervention. One logical adaptation wouldbe to initiate cooperative learning with higher degree of instructor’s involvement and interventionand to gradually reduce the involvement after judging the degree of self sufficiency of the group.Cooperative learning may promote social loafing. Latane et al. (1979) in their research found thatindividuals tend to reduce effort when performing in a group. This is called social loafing. Maniar(2002) researched team work in business and sports and found that individual input reduces withthe increase in size of a team. To prevent social loafing he suggests to evaluate each individual onhis/her contribution, give smaller awards along the way instead of rewarding the group at the endof the task.2.4 Assignment based active learningSince 1988, University of Hawai at Manoa has been running “writing intensive” classes whichaims at “learning through writing”. (UHM 2006) An internal study has found that students havepositive perception of the program and writing intensive assignments enhance learning amongstthe students, but they need to be taught how to write to learn. The strategy used by the universityis to guide students to improve their analytical skills through synthesis of the journal articles,improve their reading skills through writing summaries, learn data collection techniques , toimprove their analytical skills by examining research articles and then to present their own viewsthrough writing intensive assignments. Plagiarism may be cited as a big drawback of writingintensive assignments but a software like ‘Turnitin’ (www.turnitin.com) helps to keep a check onstudents indulging in plagiarism.2.5 Problem based active learningProblem based learning is a self directed effort of a student towards understanding the solution ofa problem. In this process the student identifies what he knows and what he needs to know tosolve the problem. (Barrows and Tamblyn 1980) Instead of feeding the students with readymadecontent through lectures and discussions, problem based learning begins with a challenge ofpresenting a real life problem through case studies, research papers, assignment etc to the students,the answer to which they have to find on their own, individually and/or collectively. This methoddrastically changes the role of the students as well as the instructor.The usual practice of teaching is to explain the concept to the students and then follow withquestions. Problem based learning (PBL) is exactly opposite as in PBL the beginning is with aproblem and in due course of time students acquire knowledge and skills to solve the problem. Ateacher is no more a provider of quick and easy answers rather he becomes a facilitator in searchof relevant information. The biggest challenge for successful implementation of PBL is thewillingness and ability of the instructor to create a learning environment which is not teachercentered and in which the student actively guides his own learning, individually or in a group.(Barrows & Tamblyn, 1980).Second most important challenge while implementing PBL is the selection of a problem. Stinson& Milter, (1996) suggest the selected problem should reflect real life circumstances and becontemporary to facilitate the process of learning and doing. They further suggest the problem tobe ill-structured, as real life problems are rarely structured. An ill-structured problem wouldenable the student to comprehend ill defined situations. Duch (1996) insists that an effectiveproblem must engage and motivate students, should be connected to previously learnedknowledge, be open ended and not limited to one correct answer, must encourage higher level oflearning by asking for solutions based on facts and logic. Duch (1996) further clarifies that insteadof dividing the problem into smaller units to be individually solved by a student, an effectiveproblem should encourage total involvement of a students group and prevent “divide andconquer” of the assignment. We may conclude that PBL attempts to bridge the gap betweeneducation and research.3. Multiple intelligence and multi-sense oriented learning.Gardner’s (1993) concept of multiple intelligence identified that each individual has followingeight facets of intelligence. Logical-mathematical intelligence makes a learner quick withnumbers, strong in reasoning and scientific thinking. Verbal-linguistic makes a learnercomfortable with languages and communication including verbal and written assignments etc.Musical-rhythmic intelligence relates to recognition and use of sounds and audio presentations.Naturalist intelligence relates to ability to work with nature, field trips, real life situations. Visual-spatial relates to sense of sight and ability to make mental images and concept maps. Inter-relational relates to inter personal skills such as communication and team work. Intra relational isassociated with understanding of self. Bodily-kinesthetic is associated with body movements.Visual based instructions using audio visual models, films, 3D graphs enhance the productivity ofactive learning environment (Cashin,1985; Bonwell & Eison 1991). VARK (Visual, Aural,Read/Write, Kinesthetic) learning strategy attempts to create an active learning environment. Invisual learning an instructor uses gestures and picturesque language, pictures, videos, posters,slides, colour flow-charts, colour graphs and diagrams, underlining and different colourhighlighters etc.In aural learning classroom discussions between learner and instructor and amongst learner playan important role. Outside classroom strategy involves spending time in a quiet place andrecalling the ideas and speaking out the answers aloud or inside head to register the content inmind.Read/write learning strategy works well when the content involves lots of definitions, glossaries,manuals, dictionaries. This strategy requires the students to undertake multiple writing andreading sessions. To reinforce learning frequent multiple choice tests are suggested.In kinesthetic learning strategy field tours and trips, lectures with real life examples, laboratorysessions, learning from trial and error etc is given emphasis. Use of case studies and applicationsto help with principles and abstract concepts is suggested. (Complete information on VARKadapted from www.vark-learn.com).A comprehensive active learning environment which can successfully engage the learners withconsistency will need to address the issues of multiple intelligence and multiple human senses. Amulti dimensional communication will strengthen the learning environment. Multiple intelligenceidentifies different facets of human intelligence, and a successful active learning environmentneeds to implement variety of tools to address these facets.4. ConclusionActive learning is more than a technique or a tool. Active learning is a way of life. There are threemajor components of an active learning environment and they are students, instructors andinstitute/management. Active learning environment demands behavior modification on the part ofstudents, instructors and institute/management. The speed and intensity of implementing a stepby step comprehensive active learning environment in higher education has to be determined bythe desire, ability and willingness of the students, instructors and institute/management.Instead of developing and implementing a learning environment which is decided by themanagement/faculty/consultant, the need identification for an activity based environment in themindset of the students has to be given importance. There is a need of a paradigm shift from theusual approach of ‘how I like to teach’ to ‘how the learner wants to learn and how the learner willlearn better’.Apart from the methods already discussed there are multiple tools to choose from forimplementing active learning environment, such as,- Group brainstorming- Think-pair-share (A tool in which students are divided into groups of two and theydiscuss their understanding of the topic after a short lecture)- One minute papers on the muddiest point, difficult topic, easiest definition etc.- Concept maps (A tool which abets in comprehending the logical relationships amongst anumber of ideas within a topic of discussion by creating a visual map of the connections.)- Students role play, simulations.- Short writing assignments/ summaries.- Classroom debates and discussions.One can pick and choose any combination of the methods and tools discussed in this researchpaper but the selection of a combination has to be guided by the habits, preferences, willingness,behaviour modification, knowledge base and learning style of the students and also the instructors.Following may be considered as prerequisites for a successful active learning environment:1. Clarity, creativity and likeability of the tools and techniques used2. Degree (positive) of behaviour modification (engagement and involvement) of thestudents induced by the tools used.3. Synergy of active learning environment with the present and required knowledge base ofthe instructor and learners.4. Synergy of active learning with course, syllabus and time schedule.5. Availability of relevant case studies, problems, assignments, tests, related infrastructure.6. Complete involvement of all the stakeholders: faculty, support staff, institute’smanagement, students (individually & jointly), and parents.7. Examination performance enhancement by the tools and techniques used.8. Within and outside classroom as well as within and outside college, learning continuity.To conclude, active learning would start with an instructor who is an active learner and activeinstructor himself and who can upgrade his knowledge and skills in the time of need. He has tothen identify the needs of the students with reference to changes expected in learning environment.He then has to balance the students needs with what he thinks is best for the learning environment.This would lead to the preliminary preparations in collaboration with the learners and would befollowed by gradual, step by step implementation of the new methods and tools.Continuous feedback from the students and supervision by the instructor might be essential at anearly stage. Regular evaluation of the learning environment is essential through class tests, viva-voce, evaluation of assignments (by instructor or by students themselves), students’ feedback(informal classroom feedback and/or formal questionnaire based feedback), peer feedback (byinstructor’s colleagues).References<ref>Astin, A.W.
