It is known thatthe exponential increase in survival is advent of advances over the years, the scientific andtechnological methods in the intervention of the binomial health and disease.Technological advances have also provided the surgical interventions, which has beenone of the alternatives for curing various diseases. The present study addressed theadaptation of women in daily activities after undergoing mastectomy, correlating it with theadaptive theory of Roy and the assistance provided by nursing professionals to these clients.The Mastectomy is the surgical name that is given to removal of the breasts. Thisprocedure can be simple with only the removal of the breast tissue, breast quadrantectomyparts of, or all, which is removed beyond the breast tissue, muscles, and regional lymphnodes. Early detection of breast cancer makes possible an intervention with higher cure oddsand a better prognosis of doença.¹The cancer epidemiology reveals that this is the second most common type in theworld, and the most common among women, accounting for 22% of new cases each year. Ifdiagnosed and treated in time, the prognosis is relatively good. In Brazil, breast cancermortality rates remain high, most likely because the disease is still diagnosed in advancedstages. In the world population, the median survival after five years is 61%. Relatively rarebefore age 35, above this age its incidence is growing fast and steadily. Statistics indicate anincrease in its incidence in developed countries and in developing countries. According to theWorld Health Organization (WHO), in the 60s and 70s there was an 10-fold increase inincidence rates adjusted for age in the population-based cancer registries of severalcontinents.¹Breast cancer may be associated with physical carcinogens, chemical, biological orhereditary; you know, therefore, the importance of mammograms for early detection ofbreast cancer, where after diagnosis confirmed by biopsy the patient goes to undergo achemotherapeutic process, but currently the only treatment that aims to cure cancer issurgical. When the cancer is identified to a woman with breast cancer experiencespsychological conflicts and emotional disturbances even before the chemotherapy, and whenit receives the news of the mastectomy impact on your life is very great because the breastsare a visa agency for many companies as symbol of femininity, this woman can experience agreat inherent conflict due to own cultural factors which this is inserida.¹The Sister Callista Roy adaptation model has been one of the most widely studied.J. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. out./dez. 7(4): 3292-33043293ISSN 2175-5361Rodrigues SM, Viana TC, Andrade PG.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2015.v7i4. 3292-3304The woman’s life…Began in the late 60 when Roy was a graduate course student at the University of California,Los Angeles. His works were influenced by his training in social sciences and reflect anindividual posture while person.2 In his theory the first area of concern is the identity of thosewho receive nursing care, may be a person, a group, a community or society. The idea of anadaptation system combines the concepts of adaptation and Sistema.3Roy describes the person as an adaptive system with inherent fighting mechanisms andacquired that allows you to compete with the internal and external changes that occur tohim. Classifies such mechanisms as regulators or innate, those whose response is automaticand resulting from neural activities, chemical and endocrine mechanisms and recognizers oracquired, those whose answer is given by cognitive / emotional channels, is behavior resultingfrom learning experiência.²The humanistic values of the Roy Adaptation Model are its definition of the purpose orspecific nursing goal. Human existence is seen as dynamic and intencional³. The person isrespected as creative and active in using their nursing process and as an active participant inyour care. The purpose of nursing to adapt contributes to the health of the individual and theunity and solidarity of the person, within its self in relation to others.4A longer description of the internal processes of the person as an adaptive system, Roysets the effectors systems. The four modes are effectors or adaptive physiological function,self-concept, role function and interdependence. The behavior related to the ways is themanifestation of adaptive level of the person, and reflects the use of coping mechanisms.Through observation of the person's behavior with regard to adaptive modes, the nurse canidentify adaptive or inefficient responses in health situations and doença.³The work was based on adaptive theory of Roy, in which the author describes thathuman beings can adapt to different situations, stimuli and environments, that is, had theobject of investigation the process of adaptation in women with mastectomies correlating itto Roy's adaptation theory, and the assistance provided by the nursing professional in the pre,during and after surgery.Thus, for better depth in this study the following objectives were outlined: verify themethods of adaptation of women with mastectomies and correlate the adaptive processexposed the woman to the theory by Roy; raise the presence of changes in a woman's lifehabits after mastectomy; determine the care provided by nurses to women withmastectomies.J. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. out./dez. 7(4): 3292-33043294ISSN 2175-5361Rodrigues SM, Viana TC, Andrade PG.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2015.v7i4. 3292-3304The woman’s life…Research conducted through qualitative approach descriptive, addressing the study ofessences and descriptions of the experiences of patients who experienced the process ofadaptation.Study subjects were four women with mastectomies, against the backdrop of the southFluminense region in the state of Rio de Janeiro. The collection and analysis of data throughinterviews conducted by analytical categorical analysis.This study complied with the ethical aspects of research provisions in the resolution466/2012 of the National Council on Health, it is the research regulation in humans. The freeand informed consent was provided to all those involved in the search for signature.The project was submitted to the Research Ethics Committee of the CentroUniversitário de Barra Mansa where he was subjected to the CEP on 06/06/2011, entitled "TheWomen's World after Mastectomy in light of Roy Adaptive Theory" under the approval CAAEnumber - 0036.0.340.000-11.The analysis of questionnaires was held in South region, located within the Rio deJaneiro, in four women with mastectomies, with the overall objective to know the lives ofwomen after mastectomy correlating it with the adaptive theory of Roy and describe the careprovided by nursing professionals.The breast carcinoma presents as a complex and heterogeneous disease of unknownetiology, high incidence rate and mortality and few signs and symptoms. Simply put, one canconceptualize this pathology as a malignant tumor, caused by an excessive multiplication ofcells that invade healthy cells your volta.5As for the socio-demographic profile of the subjects was detected which is configuredas follows:Sex: 100% Female.Age: 100% are concentrated in the age 45-65 yearsWoman 01 = 46 yearsWomen 02 = 50 yearsWomen 02 = 61 yearsJ. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. out./dez. 7(4): 3292-33043295ISSN 2175-5361Rodrigues SM, Viana TC, Andrade PG.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2015.v7i4. 3292-3304The woman’s life…Women 04 = 60 yearsEducation: 25% High School Incomplete, 25% First Degree Incomplete, 25% and 25%Magisterium not have training.Occupation: They have 50% occupancy and 50% have no occupation.Marital Status: Unmarried 25%, 25% Married 25% Wives and Widows 25%.Through the survey it was found that the findings broken down by percentage weredissimilar. Thus, our research has all civil states existing in Brazil (single, married, divorcedand widowed), has uniformity among women with 50% occupancy for those withoutoccupation 50% and also has different levels of educational background.After verification of the socio-demographic profile, began the preparation of theanalytical categories.Given the primary objective of the study, this emerged from the question that soughtto reveal what the reactions that the woman presented from the diagnosis of cancer, thefollowing results were found:There are differences between the interviewees' discourse, where the meaning ofcancer for women can be directly associated with death, due to the nature of the problem;may feel sad wanting to cry and be alone or have a quiet and / or impartial reaction.Noted in the account of deponents who was at diagnosis fear of the impact thatrepresents the disease in their lives and misunderstanding of the meaning of the disease, aswell as detect reactions unbiased view of the diagnosis of the disease. We also observed thefirst adaptive reactions, where this first moment (moment diagnosis of breast cancer) thereport of the women 01, 02 and 03 showed negative reactions; Roy classifies "negativeresponse to the stimulus," the woman 04 showed a reaction of tranquility "positive responseto the stimulus.""Facing the diagnosis of breast cancer, the woman experiences feelings of fear,sadness and denial" 6 In the urgency of view as having a disease that threatens life, whichcauses him uncertainty about what will happen with you and future , the person starts tointeract with death. Interactions with death also occur in the form of direct associationbetween having cancer and being condemned to die.7The cancer has stigmatizing character, is seen as synonymous with death and causespainful transformations in the life of mulher.8 internal and external changes, that is, inputstimuli, are in contact with the person's coping state, where the level of the person adaptationwill determine whether or not elicited a positive response to internal stimuli and externos.³The fact that it is found, at a certain time, with cancer, stage which means amovement that begins with taking knowledge that has this disease, since there are earlyindications that clarification and the decision of what to do from that momento.7So it should be noted that, at the time a person is diagnosed with cancer, she needstime to think, time to organize ideas, so that it can find a better solution for dealing withproblems. "The interaction with these means may be decisive for the attribution of meaningand the definition of the situation, orientation to action taken by the person7.The study ofthe following statements is exemplified:"The record cost to fall, I was standing looking at the doctor's face, no reaction, thenI started to cry, only after two years that I began to understand better." Woman 01J. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. out./dez. 7(4): 3292-33043296ISSN 2175-5361Rodrigues SM, Viana TC, Andrade PG.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2015.v7i4. 3292-3304The woman’s life…"She wanted to be alone, away from it all, not as depression, but with the feeling ofbeing in line to death." 02 Women"It was the worst possible reactions, because I thought I could die even though thechances of a cure." Woman 03"There are about twenty years ago, I noticed a lump to palpate my breast so I wentto see a doctor, this referred me immediately to be biopsy, then came the diagnosis ofcancer, it happened so fast, I did not feel any pain, I was very quiet, only stopped to thinkand reason about my life, that's all, people around me were more concerned with the diseasethan me. I mastectomies and I was fine, at least for another eighteen years. Two years agoI began to feel a lot of back pain, I again call the doctor, then came the diagnosis ofrecurrence, and now the cancer is not only within, it has spread to the bones and it was, Iwas quiet too, I think everything that happens has a purpose, but this time is different feelmuch pain, cancer will not let me forget he's there. But I'm not sad, I feel good, sometimesI thought I had to pretend to be sad to please the people who were around me, I am a quietperson and I ask the same to my family, they are also quiet. The only time I was really upsetwas the day I took the prescription to kill the car tax, which was written - patient inpalliative care - I think that day, the first time skin, I had real confidence in knowing that itwill not end up in a month or two, but something bigger, longer" Woman 04Given the second objective of the study was to identify the date that had been heldmastectomy, the study reached the following result: The age groups with the highestincidence of cancer among the women interviewed comprise between 40 to 50 years, andconfirmed the need for clinical breast examination after age 40, which is understood as partof comprehensive care to women's health. The deponent 04, reports recurrence of the diseasewith bone metastasis, thus we highlight the importance of performing diagnostic tests atintervals for those who have experienced the disease and out mastectomizado due to diseaserelapse possibilities.Mastectomy is a procedure used to prevent the spread of cancer mama.9 So from thesedata it is understood that soon diagnosed cancer, according to its staging, the surgicalprocedure was performed. These data enable the identification of the age groups with thehighest incidence of breast cancer, thus serving as a subsidy to develop prevention strategiesthrough tracking.The recommendations and guidelines for the diagnosis of palpable breast lesions forwomen under 35 years of age and ultrasonography (USG) for women aged 35 or older,mammography is the method recomendado.10The second category analyzed emerged of the following statements:"Eighteen of October two thousand and seven, of course I remember that day." Woman01"Twenty-seven January two thousand, a date I will never forget me." Woman 02"It was in 2006." woman 03"In June 1992, I am again with cancer, but will not be mastectomies because this hasspread to the bones, just do chemotherapy and take medications for back pain." Woman 04In view of the third objective of the study that sought to identify what was the reactionthat the woman appeared before the need for mastectomy, revealed as a result:J. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. out./dez. 7(4): 3292-33043297ISSN 2175-5361Rodrigues SM, Viana TC, Andrade PG.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2015.v7i4. 3292-3304The woman’s life…It was noticed that the reports of respondents there were differences at diagnosis(time of challenge), and 50% had acceptance reactions (positive feedback); 25% did notbelieve at first, skepticism about the diagnosis (negative responses) and 25% had mixedreactions of refreshment and pain before the procedure (neutral). Parameters being usedwith the time of diagnosis of mastectomy as (time stimulus) the word "accept" as a (positivereaction), the words "not accept" as (negative reactions) and other responses were classifiedas neutral. These results were found using the following endpoint:Time of diagnosis of mastectomy = time stimulusRejection = negative reactions;Acceptance = positive reactions;Other responses = neutral.The reaction to the possibility of being with cancer can also be expressed by a notbelieve, looking itself for evidence that depart from the idea that is in danger and that return,at least temporarily, the lost tranquility "to not believe this is really happening "as well asthe positive reactions" will be released as soon as possible than to disturb "7 The attitude ofthinking is an internal brainstorming exercise where they can be convinced" to accept theconditions and possibilities of the form of treatment chosen, pondering the urgent need totreat in order to prevent the spread of the disease and the need to undergo more invasiveand / or radicais.7Therefore the activity of thinking (brainstorming exercise) can help women to acceptthe proposed therapy. The professional of health, can act indirectly, explaining all proceduresto be performed, showing the possible surgical benefits. Reinforcing this argument, thestatements were extracted:"I accepted" woman 01"I did not believe at first, wanted to look for other solutions, each query expect adifferent answer." Woman 02"It was very fast the time has come between the diagnosis and the diagnosis ofmastectomy, I accepted, I was quiet, the doctor on the day of my surgery told me somethingin my memory - I'm just an instrument where that only through God and his power that wewill win this obstacle." Women 04Also according to the same purpose search reached a second result: The woman beforemastectomy diagnosis may be uncertain reactions because the surgery is the possibility ofcure while the mutilation of a body part of a feminine characteristic.Roy's theory "allows us to recognize people by stimuli can trigger responses, sometimespositive and negative in others, in stressful situations.11" Given the evidence of neutralresponses, we disagree with the theory proposed by Roy, appearing then the question beforethe report "Mixing and pain relief" woman 03. How to measure this reaction was adaptive orineffective? Thus one can conclude that neutral responses when generating conflict betweensomething that may be good and bad at the same time, and do not generate replies, orpositive or negative even for a short period of time, occurring after a hit, negative.Reinforcing the above analysis it follows the statement:"It was a mixture of relief and pain. On the one hand there was the possibility ofending this disease and the other had the pain of losing a part of my body that would takeJ. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. out./dez. 7(4): 3292-33043298ISSN 2175-5361Rodrigues SM, Viana TC, Andrade PG.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2015.v7i4. 3292-3304The woman’s life…me all the feminine vanity." Woman 03Given the fourth objective of the study was to identify the presence of any limitationsin daily life of these women, the study behind as a result: The main problems presented bythe deponents were related to shoulder movements; the impossibility of use of accessories,low-cut clothes and change in daily routine.“It was noticed in the account of deponents that 75% of women have a physicaldisability, 25% reported psychological limitation, "is very difficult to accept the loss of a partin my body, even after all this time I had the surgery" woman 03. Complementing the subjectthe article published by the Brazilian Journal of Nursing "This shame image is exacerbated,particularly for the mutilation of a body part, one of the main symbols of female identity.8"After excision or mastectomy radiation and the adjacent axillary lymph nodes, thepatient may develop shoulder mobility limitations, particularly in the shoulder flexion andabduction and adduction movements and combined extensão.12The causes of limitation of shoulder joint range may be different: Source limitationreally articulate, limitation due to muscle stiffness, lastly painful limitation in the individuallimits movement aiming the joint reaches the range that triggers the sensationsnociceptivas.13There may be pain and muscle spasm in the neck and shoulder as a result of reflexmuscle protection. The levator muscle of the scapula, teres major and minor and infra-spinouts are usually tender to palpation and may restrict the mobility of active ombro.4The reduction in the use of the upper limb after surgery involved predisposes thepatient to the development of chronic frozen shoulder and increases the likelihood of lymphedema in hand and braço.9The upper limb lymph edema is a frequent consequence in breast surgery plusaxillary’s dissection. One third of patients treated for breast tumors develop lymph edema,the severity of which varies and may be mild or very severe, leading to functional constraints,aesthetic problems, and even profissionais.13Lymph edema develops from an imbalance between demand and capacity lymphaticsystem draining lymph. The proteins of high molecular weight are outside into theinterstitium. Increasing the concentration of protein in the vascular means generates changesin osmotic pressure, and results in the ultimate presence in the interstitial fluid that is thelinfedema.13It is noticed that all the women interviewed reported some difficulties to deal withthe limitations imposed by breast surgery, the respondents experience the difficulties ofadapting to a new reality, thus complementing the matter Roy describes the person as "anadaptive system with mechanisms confrontations innate and acquired which allow you tocompete with the internal and external changes that rushes you.2”We tried to in the following lines, portray the results found:"I brought, I cannot make efforts repeatedly, cannot walk fast, I cannot wear braceletson her arm, I cannot sunbathe, feel shoulder pain and cannot catch weight." Woman 01"I brought, I cannot use low-cut blouses, there were changes in the clothes" Woman02"I did not bring me any physical limitation, but the psychological persists because itJ. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. out./dez. 7(4): 3292-33043299ISSN 2175-5361Rodrigues SM, Viana TC, Andrade PG.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2015.v7i4. 3292-3304The woman’s life…is very difficult to accept the loss of a part in my body, even after all this time I had thesurgery" woman 03"Yes, mastectomy withdrew all my direct mama, I did not put prosthesis at the timemore or less saw years ago I saw no need for such a thing, and I see today, but there arecertain environments that I feel uncomfortable, go to the beach, for example. Today withthe recurrence of the disease, where it was also for bones, many feel back pain, repetitivestrain cannot do, I had to stop activities carried out before, such as weight lifting, swimming,water aerobics; riding a motorcycle. I had to change my routine." Women 04Given the fifth objective of the study, which aimed to identify if there was change inthe lives of these women after mastectomy, the result was: The category analyzed identifiedthat 75% of women showed no change in life after mastectomy, 25% reported change inroutine, but still does not characterize this change as bad. Illustrating the above arguments,the following statements:"No, improved until today I am even happier, was a lesson for my life." Woman 01"He had in everyday life, only in the head." Woman 02"There were no changes in my daily life." Woman 03"Yes, and recurrence of the disease cannot do the same things as before, with that, Ichanged my routine before practiced many physical exercises, today I cannot due to theintense back pain, I try to take my time going to the movies, talking with friends, watchingtelevision, reading good books, traveling. I do not feel upset about this; I'm just living longer,doing things that previously did not. Also go to a psychologist who helps me a lot." Woman04Given the sixth goal of the study, which emerged from the need to evaluate the careprovided by nursing professionals’ pre, during and after surgery, the study reached thefollowing results: Unprepared of the nursing care professional to act following a surgicalmastectomy process.There were differences in the assessment of care provided by nursing professionals;case reports that characterized the action of these as positive 50%, neglect of case reports25% and 25% professional attitude change over the years. Thus, the research reveals thatthere are still unprepared care of nursing professionals to work following a surgicalmastectomy process. The statements below, exemplifies the result:"I felt a part of the unprepared of nursing in the hospital that had the surgery becauseit seems that they were not trained for this type of surgery, I was not prepared for a hospital,nursing group was not aware of my state, but where I did radiotherapy and chemotherapy Ifelt a lot better staff training. "Woman 01"I have nothing to complain about, very good, quiet by all.” Women 02"The assistance of nursing professionals was great, away from my family because theyhave helped me in the postoperative period in the INCA (Cancer Hospital of Rio de Janeiro."Woman 03“Twenty years ago when I made the mastectomy, I thought it lacked attention ofnursing professionals, lacked a nursing to look at the person not only as a disease but with apatient, the nurse does not know how important a handshake, a conversation.

We agree with Roy at this point, where it describes that "the constantinteraction of people with their environment is characterized by internal and externalchanges. In this changing world people need to maintain its own integrity; that is, each personcontinuously adapts4”. For better understanding we extract the following statements:"I learned a lot with cancer, I had a lesson in my life, I now accepted all betterunderstand each other better." Woman 01"Well, I never had problems, today it's all normal.” Women 02"Despite the reduction in my self-esteem’s trying to ma adapt to this new reality andI thank God for giving me the chance to survive this disease." Woman 03"It may seem to undermost on my part, but I feel good, I try to live my quiet life,enjoying every moment, without worrying too much about tomorrow." Woman 04Finally the study showed that it is essential that women stop and make an innerreflection exercise in diagnostic moments, and then find the best choices. As for thecorrelation with Roy theory there were times when we differ than she proposes, and therewere times that we agree with the proposed theory. The professional nursing in preoperativecare is of vital importance at the time of breast surgery the woman is involved in multiplethoughts, which can be positive or negative, and then the nurse should calm her, explain theprocedures to be performed and pay attention- for expected problems.J. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. out./dez. 7(4): 3292-33043301ISSN 2175-5361Rodrigues SM, Viana TC, Andrade PG.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2015.v7i4. 3292-3304The woman’s life…It is appropriate to note that in this study, it was very clear evidence of adaptivereactions. In the first analysis of categories can be observed negative reactions, which aredirectly related to the diagnosis of cancer, where evidence of a disease that threatens thelives leads many women to react negatively, in which Roy classifies as a "negative responseto the stimulus." Cancer in women's view is a disease that is directly associated with death,become so frightening stage for these.We found disease recurrence reports with bone metastasis, thus we highlight theimportance of performing diagnostic tests at intervals for those who have experienced thedisease and out mastectomizado due to disease recurrence probabilities.The time of diagnosis of mastectomy is another point to be questioned, there arewomen who do not accept the principle surgery, trying to look for other solutions; somereadily accept without question and others have neutral responses, because for these surgeryis the possibility of cure while the mutilation of a body part, a feminine characteristics thusdisagree with the theory proposed by Roy, where we believe that a person can generateneutral responses at the time of conflict between something that can be good and bad at thesame time, so do not generate responses, either positively or negatively; even for a shortperiod of time, occurring after a positive or negative response.The physical limitation after mastectomy was widely discussed in the study, most ofthe women had some limitation of physical, the main problems were related to shouldermovements; the impossibility of use of accessories, low-cut clothes and change in dailyroutine. Roy in his studies believe that the adaptive process is continuous, which leads us tothink that women can take years or even a lifetime, to adapt to the new reality.During the research there were reports of loss of self-esteem and a great difficultydealing with the loss of the breast, according to Roy featuring a "negative response to thestimulus." Family and religiosity were reported during the survey, these are very important inthe whole process favoring adaptive reactions; however, our research was to feature theevaluation of individual adaptive process, i.e., the representatively of cancer to the womanand not the family processes.Our research also aimed to ascertain the assistance of per operative nursing,comprising the period before, during and after surgery. The result found that there weredifferences in the assessment of care provided by nursing professionals, case reports thatcharacterized the action of these as positive 50%, neglect of case reports 25% and 25%reported changing the professional attitude over the years. From these results lead us to thinkthat nurses need to be trained better for their professional performance.We completed the research revealing that there were few inefficient or negativeresponses by stimuli. We agree with Roy for believing that the person continuously adapts,J. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. out./dez. 7(4): 3292-33043302ISSN 2175-5361Rodrigues SM, Viana TC, Andrade PG.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2015.v7i4. 3292-3304The woman’s life…100% reported at the end positive response. Roy disagrees because we believe that thereneutral reactions that do not generate responses or positive or negative even for a shortperiod of time, occurring after a positive or negative response. We emphasize that developthe activity of thinking can help the woman to accept the proposed therapy. As for nursingcare in the preoperative period, the research identified the need for improvement andtraining for nurse’s work in surgical breast procedures, this being a facilitator of adaptiveprocesses.Therefore the role of nursing in the care the woman, who had been subjected to breastsurgery, encompasses care to reverse an altered physiological function, maintaining theirphysiological functions and support for those involved in the individual's process as a wholeand their families. Roy's theory assists the practitioner to identify such problems, as well ascontributes to the field of research, because even theories form the basis for hypotheses thatcan be tested.J. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. out./dez. 7(4): 3292-33043303ISSN 2175-5361Rodrigues SM, Viana TC, Andrade PG.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2015.v7i4. 3292-3304The woman’s life…1. <ref>Brasil, Ministério da Saúde.
