IntroductionIn May 1996, officials from different agencies anddepartments—including the Mayor’s Office, the city’sdepartment of recreation and parks, and the policedepartment—gathered to announce the latest develop-ment in the restructuring of Baltimore’s public recreationcenters: the opening of several Police Athletic Leaguecenters (PALs). Over the previous 40 years, the city hadinvested both capital and programming funds towardsan extensive network of centers operated by the publicrecreation department. However, the PALs program of-fered a different model of recreation: uncoupled fromthe previous approach to urban recreation based onpublicly-derived funding and support, the PALs were de-livered utilizing a public-private partnership model ofgovernance. In this mode, urban communities becameSocial Inclusion, 2017, Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 241–249evermore underserved in regard to decreased publicrecreation programs and facilities. As such, recreationprovision became one of myriad expressions of race andclass inequality, created by neoliberal processes of devo-lution and privatization within U.S. cities. In this article,the authors demonstrate that the PAL program shouldbe understood as a particular form of neoliberal inter-vention within urban communities, one that has had spe-cific impacts for the policy and planning of recreation inBaltimore. The authors therefore adopt a contextual ap-proach to studying urban governance via the “articula-tion” (Slack, 1996) of policy and planning through variouspolitical, economic, and social forces. This approach uti-lizes a critical discourse analysis of over 500 documentsrelated to the Baltimore PAL program, including officialmeeting minutes, planning and organizational documen-tation, and annual and long-term reports from the city’s241recreation department, as well as other sources of recre-ation discourse: community organization flyers, recre-ation programming forms, and media reports.Rather than focusing on the provision of recreationexperiences and opportunities as a means of enrichinglives, the underlying assumptions behind the PAL pro-gram mobilized recreation as a vehicle for interveninginto, and thereby looking to manage, the lives and bod-ies of those always already perceived to be “at-risk” (notonly to themselves but, more importantly, to the widerBaltimore population living within a climate of histori-cally entrenched racialized fears and anxieties). In thismode, Baltimore’s PAL program demonstrates one ex-ample of sports-based interventions that are designedto change individual behaviors, urban spaces, and so-cial interactions between communities and policing or-ganizations (Kelly, 2013), particularly in regard to “hardto reach” (Crabbe, 2007) populations within cities. Fur-ther, the PALs were also a “microcosm of American lib-eral social policy” (Hartmann, 2016, p. 73), since theirvery development, and ultimate demise, was inextrica-bly linked to the shifting conditions and dynamics ofneoliberal urban governance. Originated as an innova-tive public-private alternative to the perceived ineffi-ciencies of the publicly-funded recreational model, theinevitable fiscal crises that punctuate neoliberalism’smodus operandi–and create legitimizing states of excep-tion (Ong, 2006)—precipitated the inevitable disman-tling of the PALs program as the neoliberal urban projectrevealed its inherent unsustainability in the early 2000s.Driven by the fear-mongering and self-interest drivenlogics of what Edsall (2012) dubbed the “age of auster-ity”, exponents of neoliberal urban governance orthodox-ies were pathologically compelled to trim the excessesof public service provision and programming. FollowingSpaaij (2009), neoliberal sport-based intervention pro-grams therefore have often included the potential forsocial cohesion and individual opportunity, but are si-multaneously “aimed at generating social order in disad-vantaged inner-city neighbourhoods” both in the UnitedStates and Europe (p. 252).Although this article is focused on Baltimore’s PoliceAthletic League program, it would be remiss not to pro-vide a brief contextualization of the PAL more generally.The roots of the PAL can be traced to the reformist pa-ternalism of the early-1900s, specifically various initia-tives by the New York Police which sought to use var-ious forms of recreation to encourage good citizenshipamong the city’s mass ranks of impoverished youth, andnurture a positive relationship between this group andthe New York Police Department (PAL, 2015). By the early1930s, the social and economic turmoil created by theDepression—and most pertinently the perceived threatof rising rates of juvenile delinquency—intensified the fo-cus on youth recreation programs as a mechanism forcrime prevention. Hence, the NYPD Crime Prevention Bu-reau formed the Junior Police Athletic League in 1932,which was reorganized into the Police Athletic League inSocial Inclusion, 2017, Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 241–2491936 (PAL, 2015). From its early twentieth century NewYork City origins, PAL programs have spread throughoutthe U.S., oftentimes shifting programmatic structure andfocus as dictated by changing urban realities, and asso-ciated policy priorities (i.e. the War on Poverty in the1960s, the War on Drugs in the 1980s, the War on Ter-ror in the 2000s, and the War on Obesity in the 2010s).Nonetheless, and belying the residual influence of itssocially reformist beginnings, the PAL program at its in-stitutional core movement continues to mobilize physi-cal recreation (play, games, and sport) as a vehicle forbuilding positive character traits. The program there-fores utilizes recreation as a means for the adoption ofvalues which would, it is assumed, assimilate potentiallydeviant poor urban youth into the social mainstream(Wilson, 1994). PALs today are a vivid institutional ex-emplar of what Pitter and Andrews (1997) referred toas the “social problems industry”: a complex and di-verse formation of publicly and privately-funded, for-profit and not-for-profit, recreation-based crime preven-tion and public safety programs designed to “serve”—orperhaps more accurately regulate, discipline, or police—America’s historically underserved urban poor. Withinthe contemporary social problems industry context, “at-risk urban youth” is a racialized euphemism for demo-nized Black bodies and characteristics, whose patholo-gized deviance renders them as being “at-risk” to them-selves, to their communities, and–inflaming more polit-ical purchase—to mainstream (read: White) Americansociety more generally (Cole, 1996). Programs withinmore affluent suburban metropolitan spaces tend tobe justified through their provision of physical recre-ation experiences–and anticipated physical, psycholog-ical, and social benefits–to suburban (read: deserving)youth (Pitter & Andrews, 1997).While doubtless realizing many of these outcomes,programs such as the PALs explicitly targeting the prob-lematized urban poor are never far removed from whatpopulist conservative thinking considers to be such pro-gram’s raison d’être: using physical recreation interven-tions as means of “controlling and/or containing pop-ulations…seen as either ‘at-risk’ or socially disruptive”(Hartmann, 2012, p. 1011). However, while its disciplin-ing logic has been unwavering, the very structure anddelivery of the various components of the social prob-lems industry is contingent upon the shifting ideologiesand policies of urban governance. Hence, as we demon-strate within this discussion, Baltimore’s PAL centers ul-timately became soldiers of fortune to the mode of ne-oliberal urban entrepreneurialism that increasingly dom-inated the governance of U.S. cities, such as Baltimore,from the 1980s onwards (Harvey, 1989). Below we de-tail the emergence of the social problems industry andthe relationship between recreation and social inclusionin the late 20th century, before analyzing the scale andscope of the PAL program as a particular form of interven-tion that had specific impacts on recreation policy andplanning in Baltimore.2422. Recreation, Social Inclusion and the ‘Social ProblemsIndustry’By the early 1960s the postwar economic surge in theU.S. had largely come to a halt, resulting in a growingsocial inequality within many American cities, as real-ized through economically-driven racial segregation andthe “white flight” of suburbanization (Harrington, 1962).In this context, the inner city increasingly referred notonly to the core of the city, but also to the minority andpredominately black populations inhabiting urban spaceschallenged by the intensifying struggles of joblessness, de-caying infrastructure, and criminality (Sugrue, 1996). AsCorburn suggests, the 1960s thus signaled the advent ofthe ‘urban crisis’ within American politics, policy and plan-ning, as cities were commonly viewed as the locus of so-cial problems linked to economic inequality and racial andethnic divisions (2009, p. 54). Recreation spaces, facilitiesand programs were also included in this policy and re-search focus on urban America, as evidenced by the grow-ing disparities in the amount and condition of facilitiesand programming between different areas of the city andsuburbs. In this context, the “inner city” increasingly re-ferred not only to the core of the city but also to the minor-ity and predominately black populations of these areas—and the struggles of joblessness, decaying infrastructureand the stigmatization of the urban underclass were dis-proportionately endured by these populations (Sugrue,1996). Further, recreation became an increasingly crucialaspect in terms of serving as a progressive means of build-ing community, and improving the quality of life in urbanneighborhoods, leading to an “era of growth” for publicrecreation in Baltimore and other American cities in termsof funding, programming, and facilities (Deppe, 1986).However, this era was followed by larger shifts inthe politics and modes of governance of American cities,and these shifts were to have particular and importanteffects on the formation and implementation of urbanrecreation policy, and within the operation of city recre-ation departments. As Biles (2011, p. 202) explains, theprocesses of federal and state “disinvestment” in urbancenters meant that by the late 1970s and into the 1980s,many American cities and their citizens were essentiallyleft to “fend for themselves” in comparison to the peakof social services funding and programming, especiallyin regard to federal programs and policies. The changesto these rationales resulted in Baltimore’s recreation sys-tem being reconstructed with unprecedented financialand political support, but also left this same system ina state of nearly permanent struggle in regard to op-erations, staffing and maintenance once this supporthad waned. In short, the 1970s signaled the “high-watermark”, or period of peak support and implementation,and subsequent gradual decline of public recreation asan essential social service for citizens of Baltimore andother American cities.Following Harvey (1989), the shifts within the gover-nance of Baltimore during the 1970s evidence a largerSocial Inclusion, 2017, Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 241–249transformation in the methods and ideologies of Amer-ican urban governance, specifically in the differing ap-proaches towards operating and administrating city ser-vices signaled by a shift from “urban managerialism” to“urban entrepreneurialism”. Intertwined with the pro-cesses of deindustrialization and suburbanization thatchanged the city’ s population level, economic poten-tial and demographic makeup, Harvey’s (1989) analysismarks the transition away from the “managerial” Key-nesian model of social service provision via public fund-ing and support, and toward “entrepreneurial” strategiescentered on inter-urban competition for tourism andconsumption, often driven by attempts to re-imaginespecific areas of the city as hubs of capital growth andeconomic redevelopment. In Baltimore, this reorienta-tion of the aims and models of urban governance wasconstituted primarily through the renewed emphaseson economic redevelopment projects, and the concur-rent de-prioritization and reduction of public services,including recreation. Thus, on the one hand, Baltimoreengaged in the processes of privatization and public-private partnerships in order to complete tourist-focusedprojects such as the Inner Harbor, professional baseball(Camden Yards) and football (M& T Bank Stadium) stadiaprojects, and Baltimore Convention Center, among oth-ers, as part of a “renaissance” strategy that aimed to pro-mote the city’s downtown area as a center of consump-tion and entertainment (Harvey, 2001). On the otherhand, this focus on downtown development occurred si-multaneously with the retrenchment of social servicesand decline in population and housing for many of thecity’s neighborhoods. By the late 1990s, these processeshad constituted the formation of what Levine (2000)recognized as the ‘three Baltimores’ of 1) the suburbs,2) downtown and the Inner Harbor, and 3) the multitudeof underserved neighborhoods, as the city and regionwere increasingly characterized by both racial and classinequalities and different realities in regards to economicand social opportunity (p. 140).Meanwhile as Deppe (1986) explains, in many Amer-ican cities by the mid-1980s “recreation as an end to it-self was totally unsalable” in regards to local, state, andfederal government policies (p. 34). In part, this was dueto the severe changes in demographics for many dein-dustrializing cities like Baltimore, as urban populationswere increasingly characterized by economic and socialdisparities. The impacts of suburbanization, especiallyin regard to social stratification along racial and classedlines, reshaped Baltimore as a post-industrial city thatwas losing both economic opportunities and parts of itspopulation at the same time that federal and state gov-ernments disassembled social service policies and pro-grams (Durr, 2003; Levine, 2000). This meant that asmany American urban centers were increasingly charac-terized by “a deteriorated economy, an inability to pro-vide needed services, political indifference from stateand federal authorities, and a forecast of increasing con-centration of local poverty,” recreation programs and243funding were increasingly less a priority, and more a per-sistent thorn in the side of municipal governments facedby other seemingly more pressing issues (Shivers, 1981,p. 44). An efficiency-driven entrepreneurial approach topublic recreation would also develop within this era, asthe city worked to support existing and potential newpartnerships in relation to special facilities, while also at-tempting to sustain a decreasing number of often inad-equately staffed and poorly maintained neighborhood-based facilities.As primary aspects of the formation of public recre-ation governance in this period, the partnership modeland necessity of a solution for the declining system ofneighborhood-based recreation facilities converged inthe form of an effort at restructuring the department,and the general administration and provision of recre-ation services in Baltimore. This resulted in the reinven-tion and expansion of PAL recreation centers, which uti-lized the neighborhood-based model of recreation fa-cilities but were staffed and programmed by city po-lice officers rather than public recreation personnel. ThePALs program had been operating in other cities, includ-ing New York and Philadelphia, for several decades be-fore being implemented in Baltimore, and while Balti-more’s police had previously had limited youth-directedprogramming, it wasn’t until 1995 that the PALs pro-gram was officially developed and implemented in thecity, in part as the personal project of police Commis-sioner Thomas Frazier ( “Police fill rec center void”, 1996).Specifically, the PALs initiative was a response to the “linkbetween juvenile delinquency and inadequate youth pro-grams” in many of Baltimore’s communities, especiallyin the context of the “glaring inadequacy of city recre-ation centers in some neighborhoods that need themmost” (“Police fill rec center void”, 1996). These devel-opments reflect the impact of neoliberal urban gover-nance on black communities in Baltimore, as many ofthe neighborhoods in which the first 10 PAL centers hadbeen organized were already facing issues in regard torecreation facility closures and decreases to staffing andprogramming. The turn to the PAL program and facilitiestherefore signals the formation of an alternative to recre-ation services administered by and through a city recre-ation department.On the one hand, the partnership model was de-ployed in regard to both an “inter-agency” partnershipbetween recreation facilities and police staff, as well asin relation to the primary funding of the PAL centersthrough non-profit grants and private donations (“Po-lice fill rec center void”, 1996). On the other hand, thePAL centers also directly incorporated the rationale ofvolunteerism–specifically in the context of decreasedfunding and support for neighborhood-based recreationservices and facilities–by supporting volunteer efforts atthe centers through community engagement. Thus, theinitial strategy was to implement a PAL center in each ofthe city’s 29 police districts over the next several years,each of which would be funded entirely by grants andSocial Inclusion, 2017, Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 241–249donations, and staffed by at least one full-time police offi-cer at each center, “with other roles filled by volunteers”(“Police fill rec center void”, 1996).However, aside from serving as another example ofthe processes of privatization and devolution, the PALsinitiative also signals another intersection of Baltimore’spublic recreation governance and broader political andsocial restructuring of the period. The implementationof the PAL centers points to the development of anotheraspect of privatization in the shift from the support andfunding of recreation services through government re-sources and programs, to the provision and administra-tion of recreation primarily through private, non-profitand volunteer-based facilities and services. That is, thisanalysis recognizes that the PAL centers and strategy rep-resent the re-emergence of the “prevention” rationalefor urban recreation services, as the PAL approach wasbased on the re-prioritizing of recreation as an especiallyefficient deterrent for juvenile delinquency and generalcommunity disassociation in city neighborhoods. Whilethe prevention rationale had been central to the ap-proach towards urban recreation that centered on recre-ation as a particular ‘intervention’ for and within ur-ban communities, the structure and organization of therecreation-based interventions of public-private recre-ation in the 1990s differed from previous models. AsHartmann (2001, p. 340) notes, the re-emergence ofrecreation as “prevention” and as “intervention” in the1990s was marked by two inter-related developments.First, an increase in the scope, scale and number ofpublic-private partnerships within public recreation de-partments and organizations; and second, the focus ofmany of these partnerships on the perceived relation-ships between neighborhood-based recreation programsand community stability, safety, and social inclusion.The partnership model was implemented in varyingdegrees and towards different goals in relation to Bal-timore’s recreation system throughout the 1980s and1990s, with the PALs program being an example of amulti-partner “partnership” that incorporated the pro-cess of privatization by effectively removing recreationservices from the city-operated and funded departmentand transferring this service to an arrangement of public,private and non-profit organizations. However, the PALcenters also demonstrate the relationship between thepartnership model and the re-emergence of the preven-tion and interventionist rationales as a primary justifica-tion for the support and funding of neighborhood-basedrecreation programs, as the program was organized withthe direct goal and purpose of reducing crime and ju-venile delinquency, in particular in poorer communities.Commissioner Frazier explained the PALs strategy wasappropriate for Baltimore as a city characterized by thesocial polarization of “haves and have-nots”, and condi-tions that were “a recipe for civil disorder,” as PAL cen-ters were sites where the police could directly interveneinto the lives of children and adolescents and providean alternative to delinquent and criminal activities (as244quoted in Hermann, 1996). In Frazier’s view, the PAL siteswere in a better position to offer recreation services asthe program depended on private and non-profit fund-ing rather than the city budget, and the centers servedas opportunities to build “social capital” with youth andwithin communities, constituting the police as not onlylaw enforcement but as “part of the social fabric of thecity” (Hermann, 1996). The PALs program thus signalsa re-articulation of the prevention and interventionistrationales for recreation services in this period, uncou-pled from the previous formation and approach of urbanrecreation based in government funding and support,and instead linked specifically to the partnership modelof public-private recreation. Further, the PALs qualify asone aspect of “social problems industry” (Pitter & An-drews, 1997) that emerged within the context of Ameri-can cities in the 1990s, often in response to the descalingand decline of public social services.In light of the decline of public recreation servicesand facilities, many communities, families and individu-als instead were faced with two alternatives in regardsto recreation provision: the private, fee-based modelthat was not accessible or affordable for all city resi-dents; or, the “new brand of social welfare” in the formof neighborhood-based recreation through private andnon-profit organizations and programming that were of-ten premised on the rationale of recreation as a methodof preventing social ills (Pitter & Andrews, 1997, p. 86).However, and in contrast to the ‘universalist’ approachincluded within the formation of urban recreation thatsought to implement recreation programming for all cityresidents, the “social problems” organizations of the1990s also most often incorporated the rationales of“prevention” and “intervention” into recreation program-ming that was specifically organized towards childrenand young adults, including the popular and controver-sial “midnight basketball” programs that were developedin many American cities during this period (Hartmann,2001, p. 99). The PAL centers also were organized aroundthese ideas, as each center included a “midnight” orevening basketball league for young adult males as partof its programming, which was most often limited to chil-dren and adolescents during the afternoon and eveningoperating hours (Matthews, 1997a). As Hartmann (2001)notes, these programs may allow for forms of social inclu-sion to develop between participants; however, and aswe emphasize in the following section, the PALs programin Baltimore can be primarily recognized as a specificform of urban neoliberalization. Following Kelly (2011),neoliberal interventions involving sport and physical ac-tivity often emphasize individual social behaviors and“deficits”, and serve to discount structural inequalities in-cluding the reduction of public services (p. 145).3. Neoliberalization and the PALs in BaltimoreFollowing Peck and Tickell (2002), neoliberal policychanges and initiatives are often interconnected to theSocial Inclusion, 2017, Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 241–249rolling-back of public services within urban spaces, andyet are differentiated by particular rationales and logics.Roll-back neoliberalization signaled the wider transfor-mation of American urban governance in regard to theerosion and dismantling of the Keynesian approach ofan earlier generation. Roll-out neoliberalization emergedfrom this ideological shift, in the form of localized poli-cies and initiatives that sought to construct an alterna-tive form of social service delivery and provision, simul-taneously addressing the “recurrent failures…of deregu-lation and marketization” (Peck & Tickell, 2002, p. 43)strategies that unerringly arose. Thus, as Brenner andTheodore (2002) illustrate, roll-out neoliberalization de-veloped in relation to the “immanent contradictions andcrisis tendencies” of neoliberal policy itself, as cities in-voked other neoliberal strategies in an attempt to en-gage with the realities of disinvestment and privatization(p. 34). The transformation of urban policy within roll-back neoliberalization effectively created the break foralternate approaches to urban governance, often in theform of other neoliberal policy strategies that were en-acted, or “rolled-out”, in order to address the shortcom-ings and tensions of the rolling-back and dismantling ofa previous form of governance.The incorporation and implementation of the PALsprogram in Baltimore signals one aspect of the refig-ured approach to recreation; established rationales forrecreation re-emerged, but were most often incorpo-rated into the neoliberal processes of privatization, de-volution and volunteerism, rather than as a premisefor funding and supporting a city-operated public recre-ation agency. The PALs initiative represents a key ele-ment and force in the restructuring of recreation cen-ter policy within roll-out neoliberalization, as the de-partment sought to supplement community and non-profit partnerships with a different type of recreation ser-vice, aimed at the youth population in particular “prob-lem” neighborhoods. Within the PAL program, city po-lice officers were assigned to “active participation…asrole models, mentors, and caring adults for young peo-ple,” and tasked with developing programming specifi-cally designed for ages 7 through 17 that offered “a com-bined focus on character development, academic enrich-ment, arts and cultural activities, and athletics” (Subhas& Chandra, 2004). Operating under the program’s motto,“Giving kids in our toughest neighborhoods a chance tosucceed”, the PAL program sought to display “how law en-forcement personnel can have an impact on youth by fos-tering academic excellence, civic responsibility, creativ-ity, self-regulation, and social values” (Subhas & Chan-dra, 2004). The initial implementation of the programhad immediate effects on the city’s recreation system, asseveral of the first 10 PAL centers were recreation cen-ters that had been closed or were threatened with im-minent closure due to budget cuts (“Police fill rec centervoid”, 1996).The PALs program, like other private and non-profitrecreation programs focused on neighborhood-based245crime prevention outcomes, had several advantagesover public recreation departments, primarily in regardto the differences in funding and support. While PALcenters attracted tax-exempt donations and grants fromlocal and regional non-profit foundations, the city pub-lic recreation department was reliant on continually de-creasing budgets and grant-funding opportunities. In July1996, this “special advantage” meant that while the de-partment was facing an additional $2 million budgetshortfall, and the possibility of further facility closuresand staff layoffs, the PALs program expanded to 11 sitesthat were all former city recreation centers, and was re-ceiving over $200,000 annually in donations and grantfunding for equipment and other facilities. This includeda former 7-Eleven on in northeast Baltimore that was of-fered to the city for $1 by the non-profit MACHT founda-tion, with the understanding that it would developed asa PAL site (Hermann, 1996).The growth and support of the PALs program, whilean example of the shifts to private and non-profit “part-ners” in the place of public recreation provision, alsomeant that the department was positioned as being in-efficiently administered. Later that year–and in additionto forewarning further budget cuts—Mayor Schmoke as-sembled a 12-person “task force” to examine how thedepartment could address these inefficiencies, by imple-menting increased user fees, the sale of parkland, andconversion of vacant land towards generating revenuethat could help the department “pay more of its ownway” (Matthews, 1996). While the “task force” modelof recreation planning and policy would emerge againin Baltimore nearly fifteen years later, Schmoke’s utiliza-tion of this model signaled the necessity of alternativesolutions to public recreation governance within the un-folding neoliberal climate. As the department’s attemptsto maintain a “universalist” mission and vision of publicrecreation faltered (largely due to the reduction in thelevels of resources and funding that had made the mis-sion possible), the corollary was a visibly broken recre-ation system. As Schmoke indicated in announcing histask force, if the current trends of “downsizing” and “con-solidation of services” continued, the department wouldalso continue to “dwindle to a level that is unaccept-able” (Matthews, 1996). Thus, along with being viewedas a more viable alternative and better-equipped com-petitor to the department’s recreation centers, PAL siteswere often used to explain the inefficiencies of the de-partment and its inability to effectively restructure recre-ation provision.The deprioritization of public recreation as a cityagency and service provider throughout the 1980s and1990s symbolized the “slow death” of public recreationin the city, especially in comparison to the earlier gen-eration of federally-subsidized support for recreation ini-tiatives. Budget cuts and subsequent reductions to facili-ties, staff and programs meant that by 2000, Baltimore’srecreation centers had decreased from over 130 to lessthan 70, over 80 of the city’s playgrounds were consid-Social Inclusion, 2017, Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 241–249ered unsafe, and one maintenance worker was responsi-ble for over 100 acres of city parks (Farrey, 2008, p. 232).However, these changes also normalized neoliberalizingstrategies that proved impactful beyond the public recre-ation realm. First, the highly visible inter-agency transferof recreation services from the city’s public recreation de-partment to the PAL administration and budget encour-aged the further devolution of public services in favor ofmarket alternatives (Tennberg, Vola, Espiritu, SchwenkeFors, & Ejdemo, 2014). Second, modeled after a simi-lar initiative in several other cities including New Yorkand Philadelphia, the PALs also serve as a form of whatPeck and Tickell (2002, p. 391) refer to as “interjurisdic-tional policy transfer”, in which city governments shareand incorporate particular elements of neoliberal pol-icy restructuring across different locations. In this mode,the PAL program popularized the social problems indus-try ethos, in which recreational opportunities were di-rectly correlated with patterns of juvenile delinquencyand viewed as a tool that could address the effects andconsequences of social inequality. In seeking to adoptsome of the same principles in forming the PAL programin Baltimore, Police Commissioner Frazier asserted thatthe program sought to build “social capital” between of-ficers and neighborhood youth, especially in the contextof the city’s socioeconomic environment of “haves andhave-nots” (Hermann, 1996). As a form of intervention-ist policy that was effectively shared by multiple Amer-ican cities, the PAL program therefore evidences a lackof concern for local conditions, and instead emphasizesa universal understanding of sport as a cure for a vari-ety of social problems, rather than a focus on the par-ticular forces that “might lead to desired outcomes forsome participants or some organizations in certain cir-cumstances” (Coalter, 2010, p. 311).In August 1997, the contrasting realities of the city’srecreation centers and PAL centers—with recreation fa-cilities facing annual budget reductions, and the possi-bility of partial or full closures, while PAL centers contin-ued to see increased private and non-profit funding andpolitical support—were evidenced in Mayor Schmoke’splan to expand the PAL program to another 10 centers,all of which were operating as city recreation facilities atthe time of the plan’s announcement (Matthews, 1997b).The decision to simultaneously and directly increase thenumber of PALs, while reducing recreation centers, pro-voked tensions regarding the roles and purposes of eachof the agencies involved, including criticism regardingthe role of staff and a lack of recreation training by po-lice officers charged with operating the PAL centers. How-ever, while a community volunteer at the Robert C. Mar-shall center in west Baltimore (one of the centers desig-nated for transfer to the PAL program) would describethe plan as “one of the worst mistakes they can possiblymake”, the overriding rationale for the transfer of the 10facilities was provided by the Mayor who stated it wouldallow the city to “likely get through the year without clos-ing any recreation centers” (Matthews, 1997b). The final246plan would involve not only the immediate transfer ofthe 10 centers, but also the establishing of at least onePAL center in each of the city’s 29 police districts, as thePAL program was again framed as a potential solution toboth the issues of a declining public recreation systemand the “problems based” context of many urban com-munities (Subhas & Chandra, 2004). As a form of rolled-out recreation, the devolution of services and facilitiesfrom the city’s recreation department to the PALs pro-gram serves as an example of a policy initiative designedand deployed specifically towards addressing the condi-tions of rolled-back urban neoliberalization.Despite public support for the PALs in the interven-ing years that saw the number of centers expanded to 27locations by 2000, the program had long faced financialstruggles, and Mayor Martin O’Malley was subsequentlyforced to close several centers in his first two years in of-fice (Craig, 2000). Then in 2003, after the non-profit or-ganization that operated the PAL centers announced thatthey were no longer financially capable of managing theprogram, O’Malley transferred control of the remaining18 PALs to the police department (Wilber, 2003). There-after, the program endured several years of financialshortfalls. The citywide budget cuts in 2009 ultimatelymade the operation of the PAL centers unfeasible for apolice department facing its own fiscal challenges. Thedemise of the PAL program also had immediate conse-quences for city recreation centers, as the transfer of fa-cilities from the recreation department to the PALs pro-gram that had occurred in the mid and late 1990s wasessentially reversed (Hermann, 2009). Further, in orderto meet budget expectations, the department plannedto close two recreation centers of its own, lay off severalstaff positions, and reduce hours at several centers to “af-ter school only”—the negative public reaction to theseplanned closures and reductions in services was evidentin the dozens of letters and emails that the departmentreceived, mostly in protest of the transfers and closuresof PAL centers (Hermann, 2009).In response, the final implementation of the strat-egy to address the future of neighborhood recreationcenters saw 12 of the PALs re-incorporated into thesystem of city recreation centers, with a single centerclosing and the others transferred to schools or non-profit groups already operating in the facility (Hermann,2009). However, the transfer of these facilities to thecontrol of the recreation department was not accompa-nied by an increase to the operating budget of the de-partment, meaning that recreation center staff and ser-vices were tasked with an increased number of facili-ties, on a still-shrinking budget. In many ways, the re-addition of the former PAL sites to the network of recre-ation centers represented a window into the city’s fis-cal and administrative crisis: the reabsorption of facilitiesand services into a system defined by years of decliningbudgets and support only served to aggravate existingproblems in relation to recreation staffing, programming,and maintenance.Social Inclusion, 2017, Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 241–2494. ConclusionsAn analysis of the PALs in Baltimore is also relevant towider discussions regarding the uneven development ofpost-industrial cities, as well as the linkages between ur-ban recreation and the goals and practices of social inclu-sion (Collins, 2014). However, and as this article demon-strates, the shifting relations between public recreation,urban policy and planning, and issues of social inclusionwithin Baltimore have special importance in the localcontext; they have often emerged in the wake of tragicevents, including the violence following the assassina-tion of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 and the death ofBaltimore resident Freddie Gray while in police custodyin 2015 (Efelbein, Nix & Hollowak, 2011; Reutter, 2015).Within this context, the deprioritization of pub-lic recreation—and, within the Baltimore context, thedemise of the PALs and continued disinvestment inpublic recreation—were inevitabilities. The provision ofrecreation for Baltimore’s continually underserved urbanpopulations markedly declined in the period post-2009,a situation brought to the public’s attention in the after-math of the 2015 violence in Baltimore ignited by theunlawful killing of Freddie Gray, wherein some of thecity’s youth took to the streets in protest. While perhapsnot easily attributable to the demise of public recreationwithin the city, many local politicians asserted this posi-tion. For instance, city councilman Bill Henry condemnedthe decades-long underfunding of public services aimedat improving the lives of young black citizens, includingafter-school programs, libraries, and recreation centers(Reutter, 2015). In Henry’s words, the city’s youth nolonger attend recreation centers in the numbers they didpreviously because “They are in awful shape because wehaven’t put any money in them in any serious amountsfor a quarter of a century” (quoted in Reutter, 2015).Tellingly, Henry continued—underscoring the shift to-ward carceral initiatives indicative of urban governancewithin the state of exception of neoliberal austerity—“the city has ‘purposely disinvested’ in young people ‘infavor of investing in catching and caging them’” (quotedin Reutter, 2015).Many scholars have recognized the impact of urbanneoliberalization on communities of color, specifically inrelation to social inequality and economic opportunity(Wacquant, 2009), as well as in regard to the connec-tions between reduced social support and increased lev-els of mass incarceration (Alexander, 2012). In his recent,and vivid, contextualization of the Midnight BasketballLeague, Hartmann (2016, p. 73) refers to this expressionof the social problems industry as an “example of neolib-eral paternalism and the new carceral state, a microcosmof American neoliberal social policy and racialized politi-cal culture.” As we have demonstrated within this briefdiscussion, Baltimore’s PALs can be considered in pre-cisely the same vein. They emerged and developed outof the conflation of paternalistic and punitive attitudestoward Baltimore’s underserved urban populace, which247effectively demonized the very population they were at-tempting to serve. Despite the unqestionably laudableintentions of many of those working within the PAL pro-gram, its very institutional structure and philosophy po-sitioned the urban populace (rather than the broaderforces and relations responsible for challenging urbanconditions) as an a priori problem that needed to be ad-dressed. In Baltimore and other American cities, issuesrelated to the social (dis)investement in young people ofcolor have been the primary concern of emergent polit-ical and social movements, including Black Lives Matter,and the incorporation of these issues into the activism ofcommunity organizations holds some promise for a re-structured approach to interventionist policies and pro-grams. However, and as we have demonstrated, withinthe context of the urban neoliberalization of the late1990s and early 2000s, the Baltimore PAL program wasoften rooted in assumptions regarding the role of recre-ation in the process of improving the social inclusion ofspatially, social, and economically marginalized groups.This analysis therefore suggests that the very real lim-its of recreation policy need to be taken into accountwhen designing and implementing future interventions,lest we fail to learn from the experiences–and therebyrepeat the mistakes–of the not too distant past.AcknowledgementsThe authors thank the University of Maryland, Depart-ment of Kinesiology for the research support providedthrough the David H.
