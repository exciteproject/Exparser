The present studyassessed whether symptom diag-nostics based on clinical recordsfacilitates the use of non-stan-dardized clinical material for re-search. Method Six hundred andeighty-ﬁve children, referred to athird level child psychiatric centrein the Netherlands, were, afterextensive multidisciplinary exam-ination, classiﬁed according to themulti-axial classiﬁcation schemefor psychiatric disorders in child-hood and adolescence (MAC-ICD-9). By two raters 44 behaviouralsymptoms were scored based onthe clinical records of these chil-dren. Interrater agreement onsymptoms in 50 records was per-formed. Principal componentsanalysis on symptom scores of allchildren was performed; factorscores were related with MAC-ICD-9 classiﬁcations. ResultsInterrater reliability for behav-ioural symptoms was excellent(j = 0.88). Many children withpsychiatric problems suffer from alarge number of behaviouralsymptoms. Factor scores of thesymptoms revealed recognizableand well interpretable entities andindicated overlap in symptom-atology and comorbidity. Conclu-sion A symptom-based diagnosticapproach based on extensive clin-ical patient ﬁles may provide aspecial dimension to improve thereliability of psychiatric classiﬁca-tion.j Key words child psychiatricclassiﬁcation – symptom diagnos-tics – dimensional approach –reliability – comorbidityIntroductionThe aim of psychiatric classiﬁcation is to facilitatecommunication among medical professionals, care-givers, educational experts, and people involved in apatient’s treatment as well as use in scientiﬁc research[1, 18]. The classiﬁcation of a patient’s disorder is basedon thorough clinical investigation which increasinglyrelies on structured diagnostic interviews and ques-tionnaires. The use of structured diagnostic interviewscan improve reliability and consistency of classiﬁca-tion. The advantage of questionnaires is standardiza-tion [16, 18]. However questionnaires often focus onspeciﬁc types of disturbances, such as anxiety,depression, or bipolar diseases. Another objection ECencountered in the use of questionnaires is that often PA7multiple data sources are used, and each assessor of the 62258European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2009) Vol. 18, No. 5Steinkopff Verlag 2009child’s behaviour has different information about thechild and knowledge of child psychiatry [17, 18]. Theuse of clinical classiﬁcations also has an inherent dis-advantage due to variable reliability, particularly inregard to disorders, where interrater reliability variesfrom moderate to excellent: for example reliability isgood to excellent for ADHD and separation anxiety, fairfor generalized anxiety and obsessive compulsive dis-order (OCD) and conduct disorder (CD) [16, 21, 24].This variability in reliability can partially be explainedby the overlap of symptomatology in diverging clinicalpsychiatric syndromes and by comorbidity [2, 3, 6, 9,21, 23]. In classiﬁcation, this may lead to differences ofinterpretation, for example in the principle diagnosis.To evaluate the suitability of clinical material for use inresearch we explored whether symptom scoring on thebasis of non-standardized clinical material is feasibleand may be interpreted in terms of clinical diagnosis. Inresearch the addition of dimensional elements in clas-siﬁcation systems is becoming progressively moreimportant [4, 12, 13, 18, 19]. Dimensional elements mayhelp to distinguish differences in individual disorderseverity and clinically signiﬁcant features subsumed byother disorders [4, 11, 14]. They also can help deter-mine comorbidity and overlap of symptomatology.Our study was conducted in the framework of alarger study on neurobehavioral relationships inchildren with psychiatric morbidity. Its aim was toinvestigate whether it is possible to improve insightinto the structure and value of child psychiatricclassiﬁcations with the help of additional scoring ofsymptoms noted in the clinical record. To this end weassessed the clinical records of 705 children who werereferred to a centre for child and adolescent psychi-atry in the Netherlands.The following research questions were investi-gated:1. Is it possible to score psychiatric symptoms reli-ably on the basis of carefully recorded, but non-standardized clinical material?2. Assuming this were possible, does principal com-ponents analysis of the symptoms reveal thepresence of clinically recognizable and reliablyinterpretable entities?Methodsj ParticipantsThe study population consisted of 705 children whobetween 1984 and 1999 had been referred to‘‘Fornhese’’, a third-level regional diagnosis andtreatment centre for children with psychiatric prob-Table 1 Demographic characteristics of study participants (N = 705)CharacteristicGenderBoysGirlsAge (years)2–34–67–89–1011–1213–16EducationMainstream primarySpecial primarySecondaryOther/ noneSocio-economic statusaLowMiddleHighMissingn51319210116218247106841427261321729615735%732711731351515939123142225aAccording to the highest education of the motherlems and their families. Fornhese is a subsidiary of thepsychiatric centre ‘‘Symfora Group’’ in Amersfoort,the Netherlands. Table 1 presents the signiﬁcantdemographic characteristics of the children. Approx-imately three quarters of them were boys (73%). Themajority (98%) were aged between 4 and 12 years old,averaging 9.0 years (SD ±2.05). Thirty-nine percentwere in special education programs.j ProcedureAll children were examined according to standarddiagnostic procedures by a team consisting of a childpsychiatrist (MdJ), a psychologist/physical therapist(JMP), a family therapist, a psychotherapist, and aplay therapist, each of whom was assigned speciﬁctasks. The standard diagnostic program consisted ofhistory taking, including developmental history and aparental report, family diagnostics, child psychiatricand neuropsychiatric examination, and the gatheringof relevant prior diagnostic data and school infor-mation. Members of the diagnostic team were carefulto assess the children with an open mind and to avoidjumping to clinical conclusions. This means that signsand symptoms were recorded even if they do notbelong primarily to a speciﬁc psychiatric disorder.If indicated, the standard diagnostic program wassupplemented with other examinations, such aspsychodiagnostic assessments, speciﬁc educationalassessments, occupational therapeutic assessments,supplementary medical examinations. All examina-tions were recorded in detail in written form. Theﬁnal diagnoses were established by consensus in aM. de Jong et al.Research based on clinical records259team conference on the basis of all collected infor-mation. This resulted in a classiﬁcation according toMAC-ICD-9 (multi-axial classiﬁcation scheme forpsychiatric disorders in childhood and adolescence[7, 20]), the child psychiatric adaptation of the ICD-9(International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, version 9,World Health Organization [21]). For the classiﬁca-tion of dyslexia as a clinical psychiatric syndrome, theDSM-IV (diagnostic and statistical manual of mentaldisorders, American Psychiatric Association [1]) wasused, since the MAC-ICD-9 does not classify this as aclinical psychiatric syndrome on Axis I, but as aspeciﬁc developmental disorder on Axis II. Thediagnostic assessment procedure for children referredfor dyslexia was identical to that of the other children.To assess child psychiatric symptoms, we devel-oped a behavioural symptom list on the basis of themost distinct criteria for each MAC-ICD-9 clinicalTable 2 Symptoms, based on the most distinct criteria for each MAC-ICD-9 category, their absolute and relative frequencies and interrater agreement calculatedwith square-weighted Cohen’s kappa (N = 685)MAC-ICD-9 categorySymptomAutistic spectrum disordersNeurotic disordersAdjustment disordersDisturbance of emotions specific tochildhood and adolescenceHyperkinetic disordersDisturbance of conduct not elsewhereclassifiedSpecial symptoms or syndromes notelsewhere classifiedSpecific developmental disorders1.

This listconsisted of 44 items (Table 2), presented in randomorder. Two researchers (TH and MS), who were blindto the child’s ﬁnal diagnostic description and clinicalclassiﬁcation and whose information about each childwas restricted to the information in the clinical re-cord, scored each item on a three-point scale (‘‘notapplicable’’, ‘‘somewhat or sometimes applicable’’,‘‘distinctly or often applicable’’) on the basis ofdiagnostic data from patient ﬁles. Six hundred andeighty-ﬁve ﬁles could be assessed in this way; theother 20 ﬁles were no longer available. To determineinterrater reliability of symptom scores, 50 of total685 ﬁles were selected at random and scored by bothresearchers separately.j Statistical analysisInterrater reliability for the 44 items of the symptomlist was, due to their ordinal level of measurement,determined by square-weighted Cohen’s kappa [5].Kappa’s were calculated by the statistical packageAGREE, version 7.002, and were interpreted accord-ing to Landis and Koch [15].The interrelationships of the symptoms wereinvestigated by principal components analysis (PCA)with Varimax-rotation. The median standardizedfactor score of each symptom was compared to theMAC-ICD-9 clinical psychiatric syndromes, using theKruskal–Wallis test. This non-parametric test waschosen since the non-homogeneity of the variancesdid not allow for a parametric test. Post hoc com-parisons were made by using the method described bySiegel and Castellan [22].PCA and Kruskal–Wallis test were performed byuse of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences(SPSS), version 12.1. Results were considered statis-tically signiﬁcant at P < 0.05.Resultsj Prevalence of clinical psychiatric syndromesThe prevalence of the clinical psychiatric syndromesin the study population (n = 685), listed MAC-ICD-9order, was:• Autistic disorders (n = 120; 18%); in this contextautistic disorders includes all disorders in the aut-ism spectrum• Neurotic disorders (n = 54; 8%)• Adjustment disorders (n = 89; 13%)• Disturbance of emotions speciﬁc to childhood andadolescence (n = 210; 31%)• Hyperkinetic disorders (n = 54; 8%)• Disturbance of conduct not elsewhere classiﬁed(n = 76; 11%), henceforth referred to as CDs• Special symptoms or syndromes not elsewhereclassiﬁed (tics, stuttering, disorders of eating,etcetera) (n = 30; 4%)• Dyslexia (n = 44; 6%); not mentioned as psychiat-ric syndrome on Axis I in the MAC-ICD-9, but as aspeciﬁc disorder in development on Axis II• No psychiatric diagnosis (n = 8; 1%); no childpsychiatric problems were found after child psy-chiatric assessment.j Prevalence of symptomsThe prevalence of each symptom is shown in Table 2.In 20% of children, eight or fewer symptoms wereidentiﬁed, in 33%, nine to 12 symptoms, in 30%, 13 to16 symptoms, in 16%, 17 or more symptoms.j Interrater reliability of symptom scoringThe mean kappa of items in the psychiatric symptomlist was 0.88 (Table 2). Interrater reliability wasvery good’ for 32 items (j > 0.80), good’ for sixitems (0.66 < j £ 0.80) and moderate’ for one item(hypoactivity; j = 0.54). The Cohen’s kappa for ﬁveinfrequent symptoms could not be determined, butboth assessors had high levels of agreement; on two ofthe ﬁve items both assessors scored 0’, for threeitems, one assessor consistently scored 0’, the otherscored 1’ once.j Principal component analysis of the symptomsSix symptoms which were scored in less than 2% ofthe children were not included in PCA: briefdepressive reaction’, socialised disturbance of con-duct’, mild or transient disturbance of conduct’,elective mutism’, trichotillomania’ and compulsiveCDs’.PCA was performed for the remaining 38 symp-toms in 677 subjects (in eight subjects one or moresymptoms was missing). PCA produced 12 Eigen-values greater than unity. The scree-plot howeverindicated that the elbow of the plot, which separatesthe most important factors, was situated after sixfactors. Therefore, and for reasons of interpretation,we chose the six-factor solution. The six factorscombined explained 37.4% of the total variance.

Children classiﬁed ashaving a hyperkinetic disorder or as having a CDaccording to MAC-ICD-9 scored signiﬁcantly higheron factor two, disorders in attention, activity, andconduct, than children with most other MAC-ICD-9syndromes. The difference was substantially greaterfor hyperkinetic disorders than for CDs. Childrenwith dyslexia and those with the clinical psychiatricsyndrome hyperkinetic disorders scored signiﬁcantlyhigher on factor ﬁve, learning disabilities with deﬁcitsin attention and motor control, than children withother MAC-ICD-9 clinical psychiatric syndromes. Therelationship between the other three factor scores andMAC-ICD-9 classiﬁcations was less speciﬁc.DiscussionThe present study indicates that it is possible to scorepsychiatric symptoms reliably from clinical mate-rial collected in a non-standardized way. Principalcomponents analysis of the symptoms yielded wellinterpretable, clinically recognizable entities withreasonable correspondences to the clinical psychiatricsyndromes. It also illustrated the existence of a sub-stantial amount of overlap in symptomatology andcomorbidity.j Methodological considerationsIt might be considered a weak point that we used theMAC-ICD-9 instead of more recently developedclassiﬁcation systems such as the DSM-IV for theclassiﬁcation of clinical syndromes. The use of thisolder system is due to the fact that the project startedin 1984. We considered continued use of the MAC-ICD-9 classiﬁcation system more reliable than a mid-course change in the classiﬁcation system, sinceconversion of the oldest data to another system wouldhave entailed the loss of information. An additionalargument to continue with the MAC-ICD-9 was thatin our opinion more recent systems initially paid lessattention to the child’s developmental and environ-mental variables does than the MAC-ICD-9.MAC-ICD-9 was also used to generate the list ofthe most prevalent child psychiatric symptoms. Theuse of the most prevalent symptoms implies that thelist is not profuse. This underscores the notion thatthe present symptom list cannot replace clinicaldiagnostics and classiﬁcation. In addition, it shouldbe noted that rarely occurring symptoms such astrichotillomania’, elective mutism’, gambling andstealing’, and disturbance of social conduct’ were notincluded in PCA.It is also noteworthy that symptoms belonging tothe MAC-ICD-9 clinical syndrome of adjustmentdisorders were scored infrequently. Possibly the pa-tient ﬁles did not provide sufﬁcient information aboutM. de Jong et al.Research based on clinical records263temporary aspects of the adjustment disorder. Themost likely explanation is that the signs of malad-justment were interpreted as mild signs of other dis-orders, such as emotional disorder.A limitation of the PCA based on symptoms notedin clinical records is that any bias in the clinicallycollected information is by deﬁnition transferred tothe relevant clinical symptom association. In otherwords, a PCA based on symptoms noted in clinicalrecords cannot be compared to PCA based on indi-cations derived from standardized and unbiasedquestionnaires.Symptom diagnostics, like other dimensionalapproaches, have the limitation that symptoms onlyare a part of the expression of the childhood psy-chopathology, so it can never replace a classiﬁcationsystem in which all aspects of development, somaticconditions, family history and genetics are taken intoaccount.The strength of the present study is the studypopulation, which was not a selected university hos-pital population, but consisted of a large number ofchildren referred to a regional centre for child psy-chiatry. This implies that our population can beconsidered a reliable representation of the generalpsychiatric population. In addition, our data were notbased on behavioural information collected by meansof questionnaires, but on extensive child psychiatricdiagnostics, including an interview. Hartman et al.[10] demonstrated that information based on a psy-chiatric interview is considerably more reliable thanthat those based on questionnaires.j Practical implicationsSymptom diagnostics provide information about thepresence or absence of psychopathology and aboutthe degree to which psychopathology manifests itselfin the individual patient. Our study indicated thatmany children with psychiatric problems suffer froma large number of symptoms. This may explain whydiagnostics at the clinical classiﬁcation level is difﬁ-cult and relatively unreliable. It also reﬂects thecomorbid nature of childhood psychiatric disorders.The data on the relationships between the MAC-ICD-9 clinical syndromes and the symptom basedfactor scores nicely illustrated two phenomena whichcomplicate diagnostics in children with psychiatricmorbidity, i.e. criterion overlap (the fact that similarsymptoms are used for the classiﬁcation of differ-ent syndromes) and comorbidity. For example, ourﬁndings indicated that children with hyperkineticdisorders often had problems in motor control incombination with learning disabilities. The combi-nation of hyperkinetic disorder and problems inmotor control is well known and referred to in theliterature as deﬁcits in attention, motor control, andperception (DAMP [8]).The results also demonstrated that factor scoresautistic symptoms (factor 1), disorders in attention,activity and conduct (factor 2) and learning disabili-ties with deﬁcits in attention and motor control (factor5) corresponded strongly to their related clinicalpsychiatric syndromes. Factor scores emotional dis-abilities (factor 3), anxiety and obsessive compulsivedisorders (factor 4), and functional disorders (factor 6)were less speciﬁc for a MAC-ICD-9 classiﬁcation. Onepossible explanation for this ﬁnding is that the MAC-ICD-9 classiﬁcation system, from which all of thesymptoms are derived, includes many mixed disor-ders hallmarked by comorbidity [16]. The substantialdegree of criterion overlap, the fact that clinical psy-chiatric syndromes are insufﬁciently discriminating,and the presence of comorbidity we consider to beimportant contributing factors to the variability ininterrater reliability in child psychiatric classiﬁcation.Factors such as referral bias and speciﬁc features ofthe clinician (i.e. education level, experience, worksetting) and the variance in sources of informationabout the child also play a part in this process. Thevariability in interrater reliability for the classiﬁcationof different clinical psychiatric syndromes is causefor concern, particularly since governmental andinstitutional policies are increasingly based on theseclassiﬁcations.j Concluding remarksThe present study indicated that diagnostic material,as acquired by an extensive, systematic diagnosticprocess, and elaborately documented in patient ﬁles,is suitable for evaluation by third party assessors andtherefore for scientiﬁc research. Scoring of problem-atic behaviour as symptoms on the basis of diagnosticmaterial has turned out to be possible with a highlevel of reliability. Symptom diagnostics based onextensively documented patient ﬁles of careful, butnon-standardized child psychiatric assessments sup-port the reliability of classiﬁcation by addition of aspecial dimension to classiﬁcation. Hence our studysuggests that for child psychiatric research, thissymptom-based dimensional diagnostic approachis a strengthening tool. The dimensional approachhighlights the overlap in symptomatology and of264European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2009) Vol. 18, No. 5Steinkopff Verlag 2009comorbidity and facilitates insight in the type andseverity of individual psychopathology, and therebyon the impact on the child’s social environment. Inturn, improved insight has implications for treatment.However, symptom diagnostics cannot replace clini-cal diagnostics in child psychiatry.j Acknowledgment The Open Ankh foundation provided financialsupport for this study.References1.
