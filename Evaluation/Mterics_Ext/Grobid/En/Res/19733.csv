ABSTRACTby Michal Grajek*Diffusion of ISO 9000 Standards and International TradeInvestigating the link between ISO 9000 standards and bilateral exports, thispaper contributes to the literature on standardization and international trade. Adebate exists as to how ISO 9000 impacts trade. First, it has been argued thatISO 9000 is a “common language” that lowers information asymmetriesbetween firms, thus allowing more efficient organization of inter-firm trade.Second, ISO 9000 has been criticized as a means of introducing market-entrybarriers and a tariff on international trade. To assess the actual impact weestimate a gravity equation for bilateral exports incorporating ISO 9000adoptions in each country as factors affecting bilateral trade barriers.Endogeneity issues are carefully addressed. To obtain additional insights, weseparately estimate an ISO 9000 international diffusion equation. In general, ourresults support the “common language” hypothesis, i.e., the empirical tests findboth domestic and foreign ISO 9000 adoptions to benefit bilateral exports.Moreover, we find evidence for a substitution effect, as ISO 9000 certified firmstend to trade with each other more than with uncertified firms. Consequently,the positive impact of these standards on trade is more pronounced among ISO9000 abundant countries.Keywords: Gravity Model, International Trade, ISO 9000, Adoption of Standards,Network Effects, CompatibilityJEL Classification: C51, C52, F15*Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung (WZB), Reichpietschufer 50, 10785 Berlin,Germany, tel.: +49 30 25 491 419, fax: +49 30 25 491 444, email: grajek@wz-berlin.de.

Über die Auswirkung von ISO 9000 auf den internationalenHandel existiert eine rege Debatte. Einerseits wurde argumentiert, dass die ISO9000 Normen eine „gemeinsame Sprache“ bilden, die die Informations-asymmetrie zwischen Unternehmen mindert und dadurch einen effizienterenHandel zwischen ihnen gewährt. Andererseits wurde ISO 9000 kritisiert als einMittel zur Einführung eines Marktzugangshemmnisses und als eine Steuer aufden internationalen Handel. Um die tatsächliche Auswirkung zu beurteilen,schätzen wir eine Gravitätsgleichung für die bilateralen Exportumsätze, die dienationalen Einführungszahlen von ISO 9000 als Determinanten derbeidseitigen Handelshemmnisse berücksichtigt. Die Endogenitätsproblematikwird sorgfältig behandelt. Um zusätzliche Einsichten zu gewinnen, schätzen wirgetrennt eine Gleichung der weltweiten Diffusion von ISO 9000. UnsereErgebnisse bestätigen im Allgemeinen die Hypothese der „gemeinsamenSprache“, d.h. die empirischen Überprüfungen stellen fest, dass sich dieinländischen sowie auch die ausländischen Einführungszahlen dieser Normenpositiv auf die Exportumsätze der Handelspartner auswirken. Außerdem findenwir Anzeichen eines Substitutionseffektes, da die mit ISO 9000 zertifiziertenUnternehmen zu mehr Handel mit anderen zertifizierten Unternehmen neigenals mit nicht zertifizierten Unternehmen. Folglich ist die positive Auswirkung derISO 9000 Normierung auf den Handel zwischen den Ländern mit einer hohenNormierungsquote stärker ausgeprägt.iv1. IntroductionThe main goal of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is toharmonize standards around the world, which, as it is widely claimed, promotes trade andtherefore global welfare. Examples of the work done by ISO include technical, environmental,and management standards. ISO 9000 family of standards – often referred to as genericquality management standards – is one of them. The vision of the developers is that(…) through its worldwide acceptance and use, the ISO 9000 family of standards will provide an effectivemeans for improving the performance of individual organizations and providing confidence to people andorganizations that products (goods and services) will meet their expectations thereby enhancing trade,global prosperity and individual well-being.1Critics of ISO 9000 claim, however, that it is merely a barrier to market entry and atariff on international trade. There are valid arguments on both sides. On the one hand, ISO9000 might be a common language, which lowers informational asymmetry between firmsand allows them to organize trade more efficiently. Indeed, the standards emphasize clear andopen communication with customers, as well as with suppliers.2 Furthermore, they provide atool facilitating screening and performance evaluation. Consequently, learning this commonlanguage offers an alternative for establishing vertical relations based on long-termrelationship and brand reputation. On the other hand, ISO 9000 has been used as a standardagainst which to assess performance in government procurements and in setting of minimumquality requirements for imports. This raises a concern that the standard is mainly a tool forprotecting domestic markets.This paper empirically investigates the impact of ISO 9000 on international trade. Weestimate a gravity equation for bilateral trade incorporating ISO 9000 adoptions in eachcountry as factors affecting bilateral trade barriers. As it has been pointed out in the literature,the causality might go both ways. International trade might benefit (suffer) from standards’harmonization, as trade barriers decrease (increase); and standardization process might in turnbe determined by intensity of foreign trade, which indicates openness of an economy ( see e.g.Casella, 1996; Moenius, 2000). As a consequence, empirical models of international tradeusing standardization as an explanatory variable may suffer from endogeneity bias. We1 http://www.tc176.org/About176.asp2 See ISO (2001).1carefully address this issue in the paper. Statistical tests do not reject strict exogeneity of ISO9000 adoptions in our gravity equation. As we discuss later, however, there are reasons tobelieve that this result does not hold for other standards. Although, we do not need toendogenize ISO 9000 adoptions for consistency of gravity equation results, we estimate itsinternational diffusion equation to obtain additional insights.The empirical literature investigating the impact of common standards on trade isscarce. In particular, we are not aware of any study that investigates the performance of ISO9000 in this context. Few existing empirical analyses of ISO 9000 focus on managers’motivation to seek the certification and on market reaction to it. Examples include Andersonet. al. (1999), who find that after controlling for regulatory and customer pressures, providingcredible signals of quality assurance to external parties motivates the adoption decision.Further, Docking and Dowen (1999) examine the reaction of the firms’ stock price to theannouncement of ISO 9000 registration. They find that, for smaller firms, investors reactpositively to the announcement and that there was no significant reaction for larger firms.The work by Moenius (2000), looking at the impact of country-specific and bilaterallyshared product and process standards on international trade, is probably closest to our work.He finds that both country-specific and shared standards are favorable to trade. Similarly,Swann et al. (1996) report that both international and country-specific product standardspromote imports into the U.K. Further, Blind (2001) analyses Switzerland’s trade ofmeasurement and testing products with Germany, France, and the U.K. He finds that the stockof both national and international standards in this sector has a positive impact on the tradeflows. In turn, Blind (2002) investigates factors responsible for intensity of standardization in20 industrial sectors of seven countries. He reports empirical evidence on the positive relationbetween the stock of national and international standards in a sector and the ratio of exports tototal production in that sector.More generally, our work also relates to the strand of literature considering the role ofnetworks in reducing information costs associated with international trade (e.g. Rauch, 1999;Rauch and Trindade, 2002). In our view, the role of ISO 9000 for international trade verymuch overlaps with the role of ethnic Chinese networks for trade studied by Rauch andTrindade (2002). To the extent that ISO 9000 lowers information and search costs, it alsorelates to the role of Internet for trade studied by Freund and Weinhold (2004). Neither ofthese studies, however, discusses the potential endogeneity of networks’ formation.2The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the ISO 9000 familyof standards and its role in international trade more in detail. Section 3 provides theoreticalmodels of bilateral trade flows and standard diffusion, which guide our empirical analysis.Data, empirical implementation of the theoretical models, and discussion of the results arepresented in section 4. Section 5 concludes.2. ISO 9000 and its role in international tradeThe ISO 9000 family of standards is often referred to as generic quality managementstandards – generic in the sense that they can be implemented by any organization regardlessof its size, activity sector, and managerial or national culture. Quality management reflectswhat the organization does to enhance customer satisfaction by meeting his/her requirementsand expectations.3 Compliance with ISO 9000 indicates consistent use of documents andstandardized procedures to produce a good or service, for which the customer contracts. Inother words, ISO 9000 certifies that the firm’s products conform to specification.The history of ISO 9000 started in 1987 with publication of the ISO 9000 QualityAssurance Standards by a Technical Committee (TC 176) of the International Organizationfor Standardization (ISO). By the end of 2001, the number of ISO 9000 certificates exceededhalf a million in 161 countries around the world, contributing to its reputation as aninternational reference for quality requirements in business-to-business dealings.4 We treatISO 9000 as a uniform standard although it consists of a series of nested standards, whichevolved over time. The core members of the original family with which firms could actuallybe certified were ISO 9001, ISO 9002, and ISO 9003. They differed in terms of the qualitysystem elements they covered. The nested nature of these standards allowed firms toaccommodate differences in the scope of their operations.5 The 2000 edition of the ISO 9000family replaced these three standards with a single one labeled ISO 9001: 2000. Assupplementary standards, the 2000 edition included ISO 9000: 2000, which describesfundamentals and specifies vocabulary for a quality management system, and ISO 9004:2000, which provides guidelines for performance improvements. Both of them weredeveloped on the basis of previous standards, which they replaced. Given that the core3 See ISO (2002).4 Ibid.5 See Anderson et al. (1995, 1999) for details.3members of the ISO 9000 family were finally replaced by a single one, our simplifyingassumption treating ISO 9000 as a uniform standard seems justified.ISO 9000 adoption is a sovereign decision of each firm; however, they can seekcertification only in their home countries. Each country has one government-designedaccrediting agency that certifies the competence of third party registrars to conduct ISO 9000quality audits. The registrars are also charged with the issuing of certificates.6 In general,motivations behind the implementation of ISO 9000 could be divided into three maincategories: i) compliance with government regulations, ii) ability to enter new forms ofvertical relations due to use of a common language, and iii) internal efficiency gains. In fact,all the factors influencing managers to seek ISO 9000 certification identified by Anderson etal. (1999) in a comprehensive review of practitioners journals fall into one of the threecategories.The first category stems from the fact that ISO 9000 has been used as a standardagainst which to assess performance in government procurements and in setting of minimumquality requirements for products that affect public safety. The Single Market Initiative of1992 initiated by the European Community involves the most noticeable example of suchregulations. The public safety argument obliged firms to attain a uniquely designed EC Markin order to get access to certain markets.7 ISO 9000 was selected as a means to attain the markin most of the cases. This raises the concern that ISO 9000 can be a barrier to market entryand a tariff on international trade. We relate our empirical findings to potential effects of theregulations.The second category of motivations is the focus of this study. As noted by Bénézech etal. (2001, p. 1396), “the ISO 9000 series can be viewed as a code, a language used by firms toextend their industrial relationship”. Thanks to standardized documentation flow andorganizational procedures within certified firm, ISO 9000 provides a screening device thatallows other firms to observe and to evaluate its performance. This naturally lowersinformational asymmetries between firms. Consequently, ISO 9000 proxies for conformanceof the firm’s product to the specification, for which the customer contracts. This leads tolower transaction and search costs in vertical relations between firms. To realize the benefitsof ISO 9000, however, both contracting parties should have adopted (i.e. learned) it in the first6 Ibid.7 Ibid; depending on the product category, the EC Mark must have been attained till 1992-1995.4place. This is why the common language analogy is appropriate.8 Learning this commonlanguage could be viewed as an alternative for establishing vertical relations based on long-term relationship and trust reputation. This explains the potential of ISO 9000 for reducingbarriers to market entry and non-tariff barriers to trade.Finally, firms seek ISO 9000 certification to realize efficiency gains. The discipline ofdocumentation and organizational procedures could reduce waste, lower costs, and improveproductivity. For example, relying on a survey of ISO 9000 certified firms in the U.S. (salesfrom $100 million to $500 million), Anderson et al. (1999) report average annual savings of$200,000 due to the certification.The same authors further report that obtaining ISO 9000 certification at amanufacturing site in the U.S. takes from 9 to 28 months and approximately 35-40% of allsites fail the first audit. Beyond time, the actual costs of the standard adoption andcertification are also substantial. A medium size manufacturing facility employing 100 peoplecan expect to spend $50,000. For larger firms (sales from $100 million to $500 million), theaverage cost that the authors report is $300,000. The above discussed potential costs and gainswill guide our ISO 9000 diffusion model developed in section 3.2.3. Economic models3.1 International trade flowsThe standard empirical framework used to predict international trade flows is thegravity equation. In a simple form, which explains its name, the equation readswhere Vij is value of exports from country i to country j, Yi and Yj are their economic massesoften measured by GDP or GNP, Dij is a measure of the distance between them, and A is aconstant of proportionality.9 Attractiveness of the gravity equation originally stems from itsempirical explanatory power. Recent developments, however, show that the equation can also8 We give the common language hypothesis a slightly different spin than Bénézech et al. (2001). Theyconcentrate rather on the role of ISO 9000 as a means to codify the knowledge within a firm.9 Some empirical studies, in which gravity equation for trade is not theoretically motivated, often define Vij asbilateral trade flows rather than exports alone.5Y YVij = A i j ,Dij(1)be theoretically motivated, in particular, in the context of classical Heckscher-Ohlinframework, as presented by Deardorff (1998). He shows that in a frictionless world – i.e.without transport costs and other impediments to trade – under some mild assumptions,bilateral exports are given on average by (1) with constant of proportionality A = 1/Yw, whereYw stands for world income. He argues also that the tendency of high-income consumers toconsume larger budget share of capital-intensive goods will lead high-income/capital-abundant countries to trade more than average with each other and less than average with low-income/labor-abundant countries. This would motivate inclusion of per capita income in thegravity equation, as is often the case in empirical literature.In the real world however, trade is impeded due to transportation costs, tariffs andother non-tariff barriers to trade. Anderson and Wincoop (2003) derive a particularly elegantgravity equation for bilateral exports with trade barriers. Their work falls under the stream ofresearch that – in contrast to the classical Heckscher-Ohlin framework – assumes productdifferentiation by the place of origin. The key result of Anderson and Wincoop (2003) is thatthe distance between countries in (1) Dij is determined by relative trade barriers. That is, itdirectly depends on bilateral trade barriers between i and j and indirectly on bilateral tradebarriers between every other pair of countries. Unfortunately, empirical implementation of themodel is troublesome, as the closed-form solution for Dij in terms of all bilateral trade barriersdoes not exist. Moreover, the authors show uniqueness of the implicit solution only forsymmetric trade barriers.10As we have already argued, ISO 9000 can be understood as a common language,adoption of which allows firms to lower the transaction and search costs. We will assume that,by lowering these costs, adoptions of the standard in both country i and country j willdecrease their bilateral trade barriers. Section 4.2 on empirical implementation of the modelpresents that in more detail.3.2 ISO 9000 diffusionOur modeling of the ISO 9000 adoption process is driven by the common languagehypothesis, as explained before. This hypothesis naturally leads to network effects in theadoption process, meaning that the value of certification for a firm depends on the totalnumber of certified firms. Intuitively, the more ISO 9000 certified firms the bigger the pool of10 I.e. barriers to exports form i to j are equal barriers to exports from j to i.6potentially more efficient business contacts, hence the higher value of the standard for eachcertified firm. Since we are interested in the link between ISO 9000 and international trade,the relevance of foreign adoptions of the standard for the home country adopters is of crucialimportance. We want to test whether economic distance between countries in terms of traderelated factors matters for the foreign adoptions’ relevance. Finding such relationship wouldgive us additional insight about the role of ISO 9000 in international trade.To facilitate the analysis we apply the model developed by Grajek (2002, 2003). Itallows us to derive structural country-specific diffusion equations from adoption decisions ofindividual firms in each country. We assume that in each country i = 1, 2, …, I there is aninfinite number of heterogeneous firms, which instantaneously decide whether to adopt ISO9000 or not. The adoption decision is influenced by the firm-specific intrinsic valuation of thestandard, denoted by vi, which corresponds to the net efficiency gains that the firm realizesafter the adoption. Another factor influencing the adoption decision is the network size ofcertified firms at time t denoted by xi(t). Network effects arise in the adoption of ISO 9000due to potentially more efficient contracting among the certified firms. The efficiency gainsand network effects together shape the net instantaneous benefits of ISO 9000 adoption,which for simplicity takes the following functional formu(vi,xi(t)) = vi + cxi(t) + dxi2(t),where c and d are parameters that capture the extent of network effects. The squared networksize term in (2) accounts for diminishing marginal network effect, as is usually assumed in thetheoretical literature. The costs of ISO 9000 adoption consist of a sunk investment in thereorganization of the firm qi and an instantaneous audit fee pi, both of which are assumed tobe constant over time. The outside option is not to adopt and brings no benefits.Firms maximize the net benefits adopting ISO 9000 when the present value of thestream of future benefits exceeds the present value of the costs. As shown in appendix 6.1, wecan calculate the net-of-cost intrinsic valuation of indifferent firm in country i at time t,denoted as v~i*,t , from the following first order conditionv~i*,t + cxi (t −δ ) + dxi2 (t −δ ) = 0 .7(2)(3)The lag of network size δ in (3) is crucial for the dynamic properties of the model. It can bemotivated by excessive optimism of the firms regarding time needed to implement thestandard in their own sites. In fact, as we point out in section 2, the adoption process takestime and large share of firms fails the first audit.Assume that the net-of-cost intrinsic valuations in each country – v~i,t – are uniformlydistributed over an interval (-∞, ai] with some density bi. Integrating over all firms withintrinsic valuation higher than v~i*,t , we obtain the equilibrium number of adopters in eachcountryyi (t) = (ai + cxi (t − δ ) + dxi2 (t))bi .The final step in setting up the model is to define the relevant network for ISO 9000adopters in each country. We are not going to differentiate the firms in a given country interms of their cooperation prospects with each other. Instead, we want to emphasize thedifference between the foreign and the domestic firms. Therefore, we define the network sizeof ISO 9000 adopters asxi (t) = yi (t) + ∑ wij y j (t) ,j≠i(4)(5)where wij reflects the relative importance of country j adopters for country i adopters. Sincewe expect that foreign markets are relevant for the adoption decisions of domestic firms, weare going to relate wij to bilateral trade between i and j in the next section. The general idea isthat the intensity of trade indicates closeness of the economies, hence the relevance of foreignfirms as business partners for the domestic firms.Finally, substituting (5) in (4), we arrive at the following adoption equation⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞2yi (t) = aibi + bi c⎜⎜ yi (t −δ ) + ∑ wij y j (t −δ ) ⎟⎟ + bi d ⎜⎜ yi (t −δ ) + ∑ wij y j (t −δ ) ⎟⎟ ,⎝ j≠i ⎠ ⎝ j≠i ⎠(6)which guides the empirical analysis in section 4.84. Empirical model4.1 DataData on ISO 9000 adoptions comes from ISO (2002). Bilateral exports are taken fromthe UN Commodity Trade Statistics Database (Comtrade), and GDP and population figurescome from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics. The data ranges over 1995-2001 andcovers 101 countries. The sample is restricted to this period, because the main variable ofinterest – ISO 9000 adoptions – is not available prior to 1995. Table 1 lists the countriesincluded in this study together with the number of firms that adopted ISO 9000 standard tillthe end of 2001 in each of the countries. Summary statistics of the variables used in theestimations are given in table 2.A distinctive feature of this study is its particularly wide coverage of countries. In fact,our sample covers approximately 80% of the world trade and 99% of the world ISO 9000adoptions. A primary reason for this is that the adoptions of ISO 9000 in each country dependon the world diffusion of the standard, as predicted by equation (6). Therefore, the smaller thecoverage of the sample, the more sever is the concern about omitted variable bias in theestimates. Additionally, inclusion of the less developed countries, for which the trade barriersaspect of ISO 9000 is potentially more severe, is important for the generality of our results. Inthe context of gravity equation for trade, the wide coverage of countries might seemproblematic. The theories of trade in imperfect substitutes, which were the first to justify thegravity model, were thought to apply only to the industrialized countries. However, as foundby Hummels and Levinsohn (1995), the model works equally well for the larger set ofcountries.114.2 Implementation of gravity equation for tradeIn our empirical implementation of gravity equation, we apply panel data techniques,which have the advantage over cross-section estimations that they can capture all timeinvariant trade determinants by means of country-pair specific effects. This is very useful,since the trade barriers in gravity models are usually difficult to quantify, as they mightconsist of tariff barriers, transportation costs, information costs, etc., some of which are noteven observable. Among many variables proposed by researchers to approximate the trade11 See the discussion in Frankel et.al. (1997), p. 55.9barriers, there are geographical distance, linguistic and colonial ties, membership in tradeagreements and monetary unions, and common borders. To the extent that these variables aretime invariant, which is very likely given the relatively short time span of our data, thecountry-pair specific effects will account for them. A particular ingredient of the trade barrierswe consider are search and transaction costs. According to the main hypothesis of this paper,they can be lowered for firms that invested in learning of the common language – ISO 9000.As it is commonly assumed, the trade barriers are approximated by a log-linear function.Then, our specification of the trade barriers in (1) reads12Dijt −1 = eηij (1 + ISOit )δ1 (1 + ISO jt )δ 2 .According to (7) the lack of ISO 9000 awarded firms in both countries i and j simplifies themeasure of the bilateral trade barriers to a function of country-pair specific effect. Since, wedo not impose symmetry on the trade barriers, ηij is in fact importer-exporter specific. Thisasymmetry is going to be important later on, because it allows us to distinguish the distance toforeign customer (importer) from the distance to foreign supplier (exporter) from the domesticfirm viewpoint. Unilateral adoptions of ISO 9000 affect average trade barriers onlymarginally.13 Bilateral adoptions multiply this effect, as follows from our interpretation ofISO 9000 as a common language. For the sake of generality, we do not restrict the parametersδ1 and δ2 to be equal, although this would fit our common-language hypothesis.Then, after substituting the measures of economic masses and the constant ofproportionality in (1) with specific functions of the observables, the gravity equation that weestimate becomes(7)(8)ln X ijt = α + β 1 ln GDPit + β 2 ln GDPjt + γ 1 ln POPit + γ 2 ln POPjt ++ δ 1 ln(1 + ISOit ) + δ 2 ln(1 + ISO jt ) + λt +η ij + ε ijt,where Xijt denotes exports from country i to country j in year t.14 We do not restrict theparameters on countries’ GDP – β1 and β2 – to be equal. We also include POP variable, whichmeasures the countries’ population in millions. The reason for that is to capture the tendency12 As discussed in previous section, the measure of distance between two countries Dij could be broadlyinterpreted as the measure of trade barriers between them.13 We would like to stress that specification (7) describes average bilateral trade barriers, since the trade barriersfaced by ISO 9000 certified firms and non certified firms differ.14 In equation (8), a small technical difficulty arises, because of zero-valued entries in bilateral exports Xijt.Following Frankel et al. (1997), we treat these observations as missing.10that rich countries trade more than average with each other, as explained in section 3.1.15Finally, λt stands for time effects, which are meant to capture changes in the world income,and εijt is a usual i.i.d. error term.4.3 Implementation of ISO 9000 diffusion equationNow, we turn to the empirical implementation of the ISO 9000 adoption equation (6).As already mentioned, we are mainly interested in the relevance of international markets forthe adoption decisions of domestic firms. Our assumption, which follows from the common-language hypothesis, is that ISO adoptions in close economies reinforce each other relativelymore than ISO adoptions in distant economies. There are two natural candidates formeasuring this economic closeness/distance; intensity of bilateral trade and bilateral tradebarriers. In the context of gravity equation (8), the difference between the two is that intensityof bilateral trade depends on the countries’ economic masses and some unobserved factorscaptured by the error term on top of the bilateral trade barriers.These two measures of economic distance differ also in terms of the econometrictreatment of the models they imply. The trade intensity measure obviously leads toendogeneity of ISO 9000 variables in the gravity equation (8), whereas trade barriers measuredoes not. Testing for the endogeneity of ISO 9000 in the gravity equation yields then a way todiscriminate between them.Here, we proceed assuming that bilateral trade barriers are the relevant measure ofeconomic distance in the context of ISO 9000 adoptions. In other words, we assume that therelevance of a foreign ISO adoption for domestic firms does not depend on the size of foreigneconomy in which the adoption occurs. This is justified by the fact the ISO 9000 adoptionstake place at the individual firm level, as opposed to other – e.g. technical – standards, whichare usually adopted at the industry or nation level. Clearly, the size of the economy is morerelevant in the latter than in the former case. Our specification of the economic closeness thenreadswij = w1eηij + w eη ji ,2(9)15 Actually the inclusion of lnPOP or ln(GDP/POP) in (8) is mathematically equivalent. What changes is onlythe interpretation of the parameters. See Frankel at al. (1997) for a simple exposition of this point.11where w1 and w2 are some constant weights and {ηij} are the importer-exporter specific effectsin (8). Since ηij (ηji) reflects the barriers to exports from i to j (from j to i) specification (9)distinguishes the distance to foreign customers – weighted by w1 – from the distance toforeign suppliers – weighted by w2. In fact, estimation of the parameters w1 and w2 drives ourinterest in the ISO 9000 adoption equation. Positive values of w1 and/or w2 would suggest thatthe firms’ adoption decisions are indeed affected by the number of potential foreign customersand/or suppliers certified with ISO 9000.We also need to relate country-specific parameters of the types’ distribution ai and bito some observables in order to avoid estimation of excessive number of parameters in (6).One could expect that bi, which reflects the number of firms with a given efficiency gainsprospects from ISO 9000 adoption, depends on the total number of firms in country i, whichin turn positively correlates with the GDP of that country. Similarly, one could argue that ai,the maximum realizable efficiency gains across firms in country i, depends on the country’sGDP. The rationale is that the efficiency gains due to ISO 9000 adoptions increase with thefirm size – so ai most probably reflects the efficiency gains of the largest firms in the country– and the world largest firms are located in the richest countries. We are going to relate ai andbi to the country’s GDP one at a time to keep the model as simple as possible. This leads us tothe following specificationsandai = a∧bi = b0 + b1GDPiai = a0 + a1GDPi∧bi = b .(10)(10’)Then, after applying specifications (9) and (10) and substituting theoretical values inthe equation (6) with observables, the ISO 9000 adoption equation that we estimate becomesISOit = a(b0 + b1GDPit ) + c(b0 + b1GDPit )(ISOi(t−1) + ω1ΣISOiC(t−1) + ω 2ΣISOiS(t−1) ) ++ d (b0 + b1GDPit )(ISOi(t−1) + ω1ΣISOiC(t−1) + ω 2ΣISOiS(t−1) )2 +ψ it,(11)12where the variables ΣISOCi(t-1) and ΣISOSi(t-1) are the indices of foreign customers’ adoptionsand foreign suppliers’ adoptions respectively.16 The indices make use of the asymmetry in theimporter-exporter specific effects {η ij } , which reflect the asymmetry in bilateral tradebarriers. They are defined as ΣISOiC(t−1) ≡ ∑ eηˆij ISO j(t−1)j≠iand ΣISOi(t−1) ≡ ∑ eηˆ ji ISOj(t−1) ,Sj≠iwhere {ηˆij } are the estimates of{η ij } . ψit is an i.i.d. error term, which capture the influence ofunobserved factors. Alternatively, applying specification (10’) instead of (10), we obtainISO it = a0b + a1bGDPit + cb (ISO i(t−1) + ω 1ΣISO iC(t−1) + ω 2 ΣISO iS(t−1) )++ db (ISO i(t−1) + ω 1ΣISO iC(t−1) + ω 2 ΣISO iS(t −1) ) +ψ 'it2.(11’)Note that ω1 replaced w1 and ω2 replaced w2 in both equations (11) and (11’). This is becausethe importer-exporter specific effects {η ij } cannot be identified separately from the constant αin equation (8) without additional assumptions. To obtain {ηˆij } we will arbitrarily assumethat max{ηˆij } = 0 , i.e. we will normalize the smallest net-of-ISO-9000 measure of tradei, jbarriers in our sample to 1.17 In case of any such normalization, the relation between wk andωk can be expressed byω k = wk e∆∀k = 1,2 , where ∆ is some unknown constant. Thismeans that we are still able to make some inference about wk having estimated ωk. Inparticular, they have the same signs and the ratio of ω1 and ω2 equals the ratio of w1 and w2.4.4 Discussion of the resultsFirst, we estimate (8) by fixed effects (FE). Typically, researchers report FE estimationresults along with random-effects (RE) results. The advantage of FE estimation over REestimation is that consistency in the former does not rely on orthogonality between thecountry-pair specific effects ηij and all the other explanatory variables.18 We skip the REestimation, since we expect the adoptions of ISO in country i to depend on the economic16 Note that in contrast to (6), time in (11) is treated as discrete variable. As a consequence, δ in (6) becomes“one period” in (11).17 The reason why we choose this particular normalization is merely that the order of magnitude of coefficientsin (11) and (11’) is not too diverse. This makes exposition of the estimation results look nicer.18 We follow the approach in Wooldridge (2002, p. 251–252), that FE and RE correspond to the assumptions weare willing to impose on unobserved effects ηij in order to estimate the model rather than to their deterministic orstochastic nature.13distance to each trade partner indicated by ηij. The FE estimation results are presented intable 3.The first three columns (1) – (3) contain results of the regressions, in which weexclude some of the explanatory variables and column (4) corresponds to the regression withthe full set of covariates. We see that estimated coefficients vary only marginally across thesedifferent specifications. In general, we find the coefficient on countries’ own income β1 andthe coefficient on partner’s income β2 to lie about 0,3 and 0,7 respectively. Moreover, thecoefficients on population γ1 and γ2 tend to be of the same magnitude with reversed sign asincome coefficients. These estimates imply that, in contrast to theoretical prediction and theresults from cross-sectional studies (see e.g. Frankel et al., 1997, table 4.2 and table B6.6),trade is almost entirely driven by countries’ income per capita. Glick and Rose (2002), whoalso apply FE estimation, report findings, which are similar to ours (see table 4 in there).The next four regressions (5) – (8) in table 3 augment the first four regressions byinclusion of the leading explanatory variables in order to test the strict exogeneity assumption,as suggested by Wooldridge (2002, p. 285). The null hypothesis of the Wald test reported intable 3 is that coefficients on the leading explanatory variables equal zero. We see that theWald test rejects the null – and thereby strict exogeneity of the explanatory variables – in allfour cases at very high significance. Without strict exogeneity, the FE estimators becomeinconsistent, so the estimates of the gravity equation coefficients in table 3 can be misleading.We believe that the reason why strict exogeneity failed in the FE estimations is thatmacroeconomic indicators like exports and GDP tend to be trending variables. This is alsotrue for population and ISO adoptions variables. As is well known from the time seriesliterature, simple OLS is likely to deliver spurious correlations between trending variables.The most straightforward remedy for that is to use first differencing (FD) estimation.Table 4 reports the results of the same exercise, as in table 3, using FD estimation.Again, we see that the estimated coefficients of the gravity equation are stable across differentspecifications. However, the estimates changed in comparison to the FE results. The mostnoticeable change concerns population variables. The coefficient on country’s own populationγ1 changed sign to positive and the coefficient on partner’s population γ2 decreased inmagnitude. Both coefficients are now statistically insignificant, which is in contrast to thefindings of cross-sectional studies. The reason for this discrepancy might be that the intendedeffect of countries’ income per capita on trade is already captured by the country-pair specificeffects ηij. This is in line with the Anderson and Marcouiller’s (2002) alternative explanation14of why capital-abundant countries trade disproportionately with each other. They argue thatstrong institutions support trade security, which can be plausibly treated as constant in ourdata.Given the interpretation, that country-specific effects absorb the impact of per capitaincome, the coefficient on partner’s GDP in table 4, which equals roughly 0,77, correspondswell to the findings of cross-sectional studies. The coefficient on own GDP is however about10 times smaller and only marginally significant.19 The most important indicator, which givesus some confidence about plausibility of our results, is the Wald test. It does not reject strictexogeneity of the covariates in first differences in the regressions without population variables(column 13 and 15 in table 4).Finally, we turn to the impact of ISO-9000-adoptions’ variables, which are the focusof our study. The FD estimates are lower than the FE estimates, but still significant at the 5%level. The coefficients on own and partner’s adoptions equal 0,027 and –0,026 respectively.This means that a 10% increase in the number of firms awarded with ISO 9000 certificates ina country leads on average to 0,27% increase in bilateral exports and 0,26% decrease inbilateral imports of that country. These results provide an empirical evidence for the role ISO9000 plays in international trade, although they are not fully in line with our expectations. Thecommon language hypothesis, as we stated it, suggests that bilateral trade flows should risewith both, exporter’s and importer’s, adoptions, since they both contribute to the number ofpotentially more efficient business links. This line of argument, however, does not take intoaccount the possibility of substitution between suppliers, i.e. exporters in this case. Freundand Weinhold (2004) argue along the same lines interpreting their findings on impact of theInternet on bilateral trade. Also, Anderson and Wincoop (2003) point to the fact that bilateraltrade flows depend on trade barriers between all trading parties.20 In our specification of thegravity model, concentration of ISO 9000 adoptions in few countries around the world couldexplain falling average bilateral imports with the number of adoptions. In fact, the OECDmembers (30 out of 101 countries in our sample) account for 75% of ISO 9000 adoptions intable 1.To explore further the substitution effect of ISO 9000 on international trade we restrictour sample to the OECD countries and rerun the FD estimations. The results are reported intable 5. Again, the population variables proved to be insignificant and cause endogeneity19 Freund and Weinhold (2004) also report insignificant FD estimate of own GDP coefficient in their gravityequation for exports. Moreover they find the coefficient on partner’s GDP to lie just slightly above 0,10 (seetable 3 in there).20 See the discussion in section 3.1.15problems. Coefficients on own and partner’s GDP are higher than for the whole sampleroughly by 0,1 and 0,2 respectively and highly significant. Coefficients on own and partner’sISO 9000 adoptions are also significant and amount to 0,063 and 0,036 respectively. Thissupports the substitution effects hypothesis. Bilateral exports between ISO 9000 abundantcountries indeed increase with both domestic and foreign adoptions. These results, however,should be treated with caution, because the Wald test rejects strict exogeneity even in theregressions without population variables (columns 21 and 23 in table 5). Now, the GDPvariables are responsible for the rejection. There are good reasons to believe that theendogeneity of GDP in these regressions is merely a statistical phenomenon and that it doesnot significantly bias the results. First, the inclusion of variables in levels does notsignificantly change the coefficients on variables in differences. Second, Hummels andLevinsohn (1995) report that correcting for the endogeneity of GDP with instrumentalvariables makes very little difference.As we mentioned in section 2, critics of ISO 9000 reasonably argue that the standard isactually a barrier to trade, since it has been used as a tool for introducing import restrictions.In fact, the positive effect of domestic ISO 9000 adoptions on exports, that we found, could beexplained by increasing access to the regulated markets. However, the impact of domesticadoptions on imports, that we found, cannot be explained by the trade barrier hypothesis. Inparticular, the finding that imports increase with domestic ISO 9000 adoptions within OECDcountries cannot be supported by this hypothesis. The reversed relation in the full samplemight be due to the use of ISO 9000 in introducing import restrictions, however, underadditional assumption that the restrictions increases with domestic ISO 9000 adoptions.21Estimation results of the ISO 9000 diffusion equation provide additional insights aboutthe link between the standards and international trade. To estimate (11) and (11’) we followthe general method of moments (GMM) approach for linear dynamic panel data modelsproposed by Arellano and Bond (1991). By doing so, we allow for additional unobservedheterogeneity on top of (11) and (11’). This unobserved heterogeneity accounts forinstitutional factors, like the national accrediting agencies, which could either spur or hamperthe diffusion process.To obtain linear models we multiply out the terms in the structural equations (11) and(11’). By multiplying out the terms, the parameters ω1 and ω2 – the transformed weights in21 Since the panel data estimation techniques we use provide time-series evidence, because cross-sectiondifferentiation is captured by country-pair specific effects, this assumption is much more heroic that it mightseem.16our measure of economic closeness (9) – become overidentified. This allows us to test theunderlying structure of the empirical diffusion equations. The estimated coefficients of thelinearized equations (11) and (11’) are reported in table 6, in columns (25) and (25’)respectively.22 Except for the lagged dependent variable, all the regressors are treated asstrictly exogenous. We see that both regressions perform reasonably well in statistical sense,as indicated by the Sargan and the Arellano-Bond test statistics at the bottom of the table. Theunderlying economic structure of both regressions (25) and (25’) is, however, rejected by theSdata. According to the structural equation (11), the ratio of coefficients on ΣISO i(t-1) andSISOi(t-1) in the regression (25) should be equal to the ratio of coefficients on GDPitΣISO i(t-1)and GDPitISOi(t-1), because both ratios identify the same parameter ω2. Yet, the ratios haveopposite signs. Similarly, the equation (11’) predicts that the ratio of coefficients on(ΣISOCi(t-1))2 and ISO2i(t-1) in the regression (25’) should be equal to the squared ratio ofcoefficients on ΣISOCi(t-1) and ISOi(t-1), since they identify (ω2)2. But, the first ratio isnegative.23 Therefore, we are going to treat the results as coming from a reduced formapproach and limit the discussion to pointing out major correlation patterns.The results of the regressions (25) and (25’) suggest in general that ISO 9000adoptions in each country are positively related to the market size measured by the country’sGDP. The adoptions also exhibit significant inertia, as indicated by the coefficients on thelagged dependent variable. Since we are mostly interested in the foreign trade considerationsin the adoption decisions of firms, the crucial result in table 6 are the coefficients on theindices of foreign customers’ adoptions and foreign suppliers’ adoptions. We find thatdomestic ISO 9000 adoptions are positively related to foreign customers’ adoptions, asexpected. In contrast, foreign suppliers’ adoptions are not or weakly negatively correlatedwith domestic adoptions depending on the specification. In other words, the diffusion of ISO9000 seems to proceed from customers to suppliers and not the other way around, at least inthe international context. This asymmetry does not necessarily contradict our commonlanguage hypothesis. It might reflect the fact that business customers are able to benefit fromISO 9000 without actually being certified, as someone, who understands a language withouthaving passed exams that certify that. At the same time, certified suppliers might not careabout certification of the customers, if their relations are already established.22 In the regression (25) we additionally assumed that d = 0 in (11). Without this assumption the maincoefficients of the model turned out to be insignificant and the Arellano-Bond test indicated second-orderautocorrelation in the residuals. The likely reason for this is the multi-collinearity of the explanatory variables.23 We also carried out formal Wald-type tests, which confirm this intuitive argumentation.17To check the robustness of these findings, we perform additional two regressions (26)and (26’), in which the indices of foreign ISO 9000 adoptions in (25) and (25’) are replacedwith simple unweighted sum of foreign adoptions. The coefficients on the unweighted foreignadoptions are much less significant than those on the indices of foreign adoptions in theprevious regressions. In other words, our indices are much better predictors of domesticadoptions than is the unweighted sum. This gives us some confidence in the effects of foreigntrade considerations on domestic adoptions we found in (25) and (25’).5. ConclusionsIn this paper, we empirically assess the link between the ISO 9000 family of standardsand international trade. According to the vision of its developers, ISO 9000 should provideconfidence to people and organizations that products will meet their expectations, therebyenhancing trade and global welfare. In contrast, its critics claim that it is merely a barrier tomarket entry and a tariff on international trade.Our modeling strategy is to look at the impact of ISO 9000 adoptions on bilateral tradeflows between countries. We estimate a gravity equation for bilateral exports using data on101 countries over 1995-2001. To obtain additional evidence, we estimate an internationalISO 9000 diffusion equation and test whether the number of certified foreign trade partnersplays a role in the domestic firms’ adoption decisions.Using the full sample, we find that domestic ISO 9000 adoptions spur bilateral exportsand hamper bilateral imports. In the sample restricted to the OECD countries, however, thedomestic adoptions are positively related to both bilateral exports and imports. Additionally,we find empirical evidence on the positive effect of foreign customers’ adoptions of ISO 9000on domestic adoptions.In general, these findings suggest that the ISO 9000 standards have indeed significantpositive impact on international trade. They are consistent with the common languagehypothesis, which states that ISO 9000 lowers informational asymmetry between firms andallows them to organize vertical relations more efficiently. The negative effect of ISO 9000adoptions on bilateral imports in the full sample can be explained by a substitution effect, asISO 9000 certified firms tend to trade with each other more than with uncertified firms. Since18domestic certified firms are likely to choose other certified firms as suppliers, the averagebilateral imports from all trade partners will fall with domestic adoptions if the concentrationof adoptions around the world is high enough.The hypothesis that ISO 9000, as a tool for introducing import restrictions, is a barrierto international trade is not able to explain our empirical findings, although we cannot rejectit. The substitution effect we pointed out might be, however, another way, in which ISO 9000constitutes an effective trade barrier. If the diffusion of ISO 9000 in the less developedcountries remains sluggish – e.g. due to weak institutional framework – the benefits of ISO9000 envisioned by its developers will stay in the developed countries’ domain.6. Appendices6.1 Optimal timing of ISO 9000 adoptionWe assume that once the standard is adopted, it yields the infinite stream of futurebenefits. The present value of the stream of benefits can be written aswhere ρ is a common instantaneous discount rate. The cost of adoption consists of the sunkinvestment in reorganization of the firm qi and the instantaneous audit fee pi, both of whichare assumed to be constant over time. We write the present value of the cost as∞V (vi , xi (t), t) = ∫ e−ρsu(vi , xi (s))ds ,t∞C(qi , pi , t) = e−ρt qi + ∫t e−ρs pi ds .mtax[V (vi , xi (t), t) − C(qi , pi , t)].The optimal timing of adoption involves solving the following maximization problemAssuming that problem (14) is concave, we obtain the intrinsic valuation of the indifferentfirm vi,t* as the solution to19(12)(13)(14)ddt V (vi*,t , xi (t), t) − ddt C(qi , pi , t) = 0 ,which simplifies tou(vi*,t , xi (t)) − ρqi − pi = 0 .Now, substituting benefit function (2) in (16) we finally obtainv~i*,t + cxi (t) + dxi2 (t) = 0 ,(15)(16)(17)(18)where v~i*,t = vi*,t − ρqi − pi denotes the net-of-cost intrinsic valuation of indifferent firms.Further, we modify solution (17) introducing a lag δ into the network size. The lag is crucialfor identification in this model (see Grajek, 2002). In the context of ISO 9000 adoptiondecision, the lag can be motivated by an excessive optimism of firms regarding the timeneeded to implement the standard. The fact that firms obtain certification later than implied by(17) leads to the modified first order conditionv~i*,t + cxi (t −δ ) + dxi2 (t −δ ) = 0 .Note that deriving (17) we assumed that the firms have perfect knowledge about the futurediffusion of network. This assumption carries over to (18). In other words, the firms knowthat the others are overoptimistic.206.2 TablesArgentinaAustraliaAustriaBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBoliviaBotswanaBrazilBulgariaCameroonCanadaChileChinaColombiaCosta RicaCroatiaCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEstoniaFinlandFranceGermanyGreeceGrenadaSource: ISO(2002)Table 1.
