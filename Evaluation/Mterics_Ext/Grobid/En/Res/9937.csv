The analyses are derived from biographicalnarrative interviews with six Cuban Americans. Three key subjects were in the biographical lifestories—the notion of escape or leaving, the sense of home, and constructions of Cuban identity. Inassessing these themes, we found there to be profound differences between the generations.Moreover, these Cuban biographies demonstrate how differing stories of migration provide newtheoretical perspectives on immigration, transnationalism, and ethnicity. The experiences presentedand discussed here connect to the ambivalence and complexity of belongingness andinterpretations of Cuban-ness.Table of Contents1. Introduction2.

IntroductionHow do immigrants from Cuba and their children characterize their sense ofbelonging and identity in the United States? Do first- and second-generationimmigrants differ in conceptualizing home, and if so, in what ways? How do</ref></ref>Cubans from different waves of emigration understand the transnationalexperience of leaving and settling? These are the questions explored in thisarticle, which is part of a larger qualitative study of ethnic identity and sense ofbelonging among immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, and Guatemala in South Florida(see CHAITIN, LINSTROTH, and HILLER's introductory article in this issue). [1]This article presents analyses of interviews with six informants from among thetotal sample of ten Cuban-American participants—first- and second-generationCuban immigrants. These six informants were chosen based on the factors ofgender, generation, and immigration pattern. In turn, we wanted to assess howthese particular characteristics influenced the experiences of these Cubanparticipants. The ages of informants ranged from the mid-twenties to late-fifties,and the sample was divided evenly between men and women. We identifiedemergent themes in the biographical interviews, placed those themes within awider theoretical lens, and then explored our findings in relation to the sense ofhome and identity. Furthermore, it should be noted our sample size wasparticularly small since these were life-story interviews and our study followedguidelines accorded to biographical-interviewing and the in-depth analyses ofonly a few individuals.

Following this discussion, we explore theindividual stories of six participants, focusing on three aspects of the immigrantexperience: the phenomenon of leaving, the sense of home, and perceptions ofethnic and national identity. A common theme emerging from their stories is what1 "Not Applicable" because they were second-generation immigrants.© 2009 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 10(3), Art. 13, Robin Cooper, Denese Edsall, Diana Riviera, Julia Chaitin & J.P. Linstroth:"My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Floridawe termed "ambivalent belongings." This term refers to the simultaneous,conflicting feelings our informants convey regarding home and identity, and whichwe will discuss in detail below. [3]2. Socio-Historical Context2.1 Cuban historyEuropeans first came to Cuba in the course of Columbus' seafaring explorations,and in the years after 1492 the island came under Spanish control as a keytrading port and shipyard. With colonization, the indigenous population wasdevastated by disease and forced hard labor, as occurred in other occupiedterritories of the Caribbean and the Americas. Some native Cubans intermarriedwith Spanish families, however, and native customs and words remainedinterwoven in the island's culture and language (THOMAS, 1998). African slaveswere first brought to Cuba by the Spaniards in the early 1500s. The cultivation ofvast sugar cane plantations led to several hundreds of thousands of Africanslaves being brought to Cuba to work the sugar cane fields over the next threehundred years (THOMAS, 1998). [4]In the 1800s, the Spanish colonists looked to the authority of Madrid, but many ofthe Creole elite—people born in Cuba of Spanish ancestry—turned to NorthAmerica and even hoped to be incorporated as a territory into the United States.Others among the Creole liberal and intellectual elite began promoting Cubannationhood in the latter half of the nineteenth century (BENJAMIN, 1990). TheTen Years War (1868-1878) was a guerilla struggle for freedom from Spain.Although this effort failed, it fostered widespread interest in independence. JoséMartí, a Cuban émigré in the United States, combined the cause of independencewith a vision of social justice and worked in the exile population to developnationalism and the Partido Revolucianaro Cubano, the Cuban RevolutionaryParty (BENJAMIN, 1990). [5]The Cuban War of Independence (1895-1898) ended Spanish sovereignty. WithUnited States intervention on behalf of independence in the so-called "Spanish-American War" in 1898, the new Cuban citizens saw Spanish colonizationreplaced by North American occupation. In 1902, U.S. occupation ended, and theCuban Republic was established. The Platt Amendment of the 1903 PermanentTreaty with the United States, however, limited Cuban sovereignty for the nexttwo decades. The next several decades saw periods of political corruption andinstability under several governments. This instability continued until the mid 20thcentury when Fulgencio Batista y Zaldivar came to power. The corruption of theBatista administration was a key factor leading to Castro's takeover of thegovernment (THOMAS, 1998; PEREZ, 1990; WHITNEY, 2001). [6]Fidel Castro failed in his first effort to bring revolution to Cuba in 1953, and as aresult he was imprisoned. Castro received amnesty in 1955, however; he traveledto Mexico, where he continued planning to overthrow Batista. In December of1956, Castro and his troops returned to Cuba, and a period of attacks, strikes,© 2009 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 10(3), Art. 13, Robin Cooper, Denese Edsall, Diana Riviera, Julia Chaitin & J.P. Linstroth:"My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Floridaand political unrest followed. On the eve of 1959, Batista fled the island, leadingto Castro's rise to power. Although he had broad support initially, due towidespread frustration over the corruption of Batista's administration, Castro lostfavor with a growing segment of the population when he turned to a repressiveform of rule (ENCINOSA, 1988; BONACHEA & SAN MARTIN, 1974; LEONARD,1999; FARBER, 2006; PEREZ-STABLE, 1999). Various groups of Cubans,beginning with the political and business elite, sought a way out of the repressivesystem, leading to several waves of emigration. [7]2.2 Waves of Cuban emigrationFor over 40 years, Cubans have been categorized as political refugees and havebeen provided relatively easy entry into the United States compared to otherimmigrant groups. Those Cuban immigrants who did not specifically fit the modelof a refugee under the United Nations Conventions were instead definedaccording to criteria contained in the Walter-McCarran Act of 1952. This actspecifically identified someone who is fleeing a communist country as a refugee(NACKERUD, SPRINGER, LARRISON, & ISAAC, 1999). There were fourspecific "waves" of Cuban immigration into the United States: the Early Exilesdeparture in the years 1959-1962, the "Freedom Flights" from 1965-1973, theMariel boatlift in 1980, and the Rafter Crisis in 1994, which led to the policyknown as "wet-foot, dry-foot." This policy allows Cubans to stay in the UnitedStates and seek asylum if they touch U.S. land, but requires their return to Cubaif they are intercepted in water (SELSKY, 2006). [8]In the first few years following Castro's revolution, a number of upper classrefugees left the island as they saw their industries nationalized. This early wavebecame known as the Early Exiles. From 1965-1973, middle class Cubans joinedthe upper class in migrating in the so-called Freedom Flights. These airlifts wereconducted with the agreement of the Cuban and U.S. governments. Preferencewas given to those persons who already had relatives in the United States andCuba banned the exit of young men of military age, professionals, andtechnically-skilled workers. A specific subset of these flights were the "Peter Pan"flights containing some 14,000 children sent by their parents in order to escapecommunist indoctrination in state-run schools. In the end, these flights broughtmore than a quarter of a million Cuban refugees to the United States (PEDRAZA-BAILEY, 1985). [9]The third wave of immigration was in 1980, the Mariel boatlift, bringing 125,000Cuban refugees to the United States (COPELAND, 1983). This was a massexodus from Cuba. Initially, Cuban-American families boated 90 miles from KeyWest, Florida, to Cuba to "rescue" family members. It ended with Cuban officialsforcing "undesirables" onto whatever boats were available and thousands ofCubans fleeing the island-nation. Some participants left of their own volition.Others were forced out. These immigrants were from the middle or lower classes;many were of African descent, political prisoners, or homosexual. The Americanpress stressed the involvement of those that were forced to leave and labeled allas undesirable. Despite the labels of "criminal" and "scum" given by the press,© 2009 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 10(3), Art. 13, Robin Cooper, Denese Edsall, Diana Riviera, Julia Chaitin & J.P. Linstroth:"My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Floridahowever, the majority of the Mariel refugees were working class people with nocriminal record (PEDRAZA-BAILEY, 1985). [10]Finally, there are the refugees who have come to the United State under the "wet-foot/dry-foot" policy. This policy was precipitated by the Balsero Crisis during theClinton administration when Castro warned that he would open the Cubanborders and allow anyone to leave who wished to do so. The Clintonadministration, fearing another mass exodus such as the Mariel boatlift,determined to tighten the rules regarding Cuban entry into the U.S. and thuscreated the new policy (NACKERUD et al., 1999). Because of the continuedCommunist government, these immigrants are still termed political refugees.However, the reality of the situation is that more and more are economic refugeeswho cannot sustain themselves or their families in the impoverished Cubaneconomy. Regardless of the motivations for migration, one result of these fourwaves of emigration is that a large segment of South Florida's population hasCuban ethnic roots. Over 650,000 Cuban immigrants live in Miami-Dade Countyalone. This broad Cuban community has economic and political influence inSouth Florida, especially in Miami (MORENO, n.d.). [11]2.3 The Cuba-United States relationshipWe now turn to a short description of the mutual influence resulting from thehistorical relationship between Cuba and the United States, a relationship thathas impacted the sense of home and belonging for Cuban immigrants. For sometwo hundred years, the proximity of Cuba to southern Florida led to trade,tourism, and commercial linkages (PEREZ, 1990). In the nineteenth century,North Americans came to Cuba to invest in the sugar industry, while manyCubans moved to Key West and Tampa to work in cigar factories. In the latterhalf of the 1800s, wealthy Cubans traveled to North America to vacation or tostudy. In the 1920s, working class Cubans came to Miami as entertainers andworkers (PEREZ, 1999). Political exiles, too, have made the short trip from Cubato the United States from the time of José Martí prior to independence from Spain.Such political exile to the United States continued in the late 1920s and 1930sand has been ongoing ever since to the present day (BENJAMIN, 1990). [12]Following the war for Cuba's independence from Spain, the United States'occupation of Cuba had a longstanding influence on the island. Aside from thepolitical ramifications, the U.S. presence left its mark on the culture and thelandscape of Cuba, as well. The period of occupation included massivereconstruction, including the building of banks, stores, homes, and a new capitolbuilding all resembling U.S. architecture (PEREZ, 1999; BENJAMIN, 1990).Meanwhile, North Americans developed a growing fascination with Cuba,beginning in the 1920s and continuing through the 1950s, as a nearby destinationthat was both exotic and tropical while maintaining old-world Spanish charm. Atthe same time, as Miami grew, some neighborhoods were modeled after the styleof Havana; and hotels and housing developments were given Spanish names(PEREZ, 1999, 1990). As a result of these mutual influences, when Cubans cameto South Florida as exiles, they found themselves in a nation that was clearly© 2009 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 10(3), Art. 13, Robin Cooper, Denese Edsall, Diana Riviera, Julia Chaitin & J.P. Linstroth:"My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Floridadifferent from their own, yet at the same time not completely strange. They werein a region filled with Spanish street and town names, where architectural stylesand plants were similar to those in their homeland, and where they often hadrelatives or business associates. Thus the land of exile was at once foreign andfamiliar. [13]2.4 Cuban nationalismBefore turning to our results, it is also important to discuss briefly the history ofCuban nationalism, since this relates to the construction of Cuban identity forboth first and second generation Cuban immigrants. For the majority of Cuba'shistory, the notion of Cuba Libre (Free Cuba) has been at the core of theimagined homeland. This democratic vision, popularized most famously by JoséMartí in the fight for Cuban independence, served as the cherished dreamthroughout years of colonization by Spain and occupation by the United Statesprior to official statehood (BENJAMIN, 1990). Along with the establishment of theRepublic of Cuba, was the Platt Amendment, which allowed for United States'interventionism in Cuban affairs and thereby instilled in most Cubans anunfulfilled sense of independent-nationalism. It was not until the 1930s thatindependence emerged, resulting in great national pride but short-livedsatisfaction. In the following decades, the strong-man rule of Machado andBatista left Cubans seeking real freedom. At first, the revolution of Fidel and RaulCastro was welcomed by many as offering hope for a democratic republic. Withthe coming of the communist regime, however, many felt the dream of CubaLibre remained unfulfilled. As a result, most of Cuban history has consisted oflonging for an imagined free nation. This imagined belonging is an important partof the continued identity that we found in our interviews with Cuban Americans.We will see in the following analyses that the imagined homeland is a prominenttheme for both generations of Cuban immigrants. [14]3. Results and Analysis3.1 First generation immigrantsAmong the six biographical interviews discussed in this article, four came fromthe first generation of immigrants from Cuba. These immigrants had quitedifferent experiences, while their divergent views evoked distinct political eras(ECKSTEIN & BARBERIA, 2002). Victor was a young adult when he left Cuba inthe early 1970s, having earned his visa by working several years in the sugarcane fields. By contrast Martin is a few years younger than Victor, andimmigrated to the United States in 1988 after years as a political prisoner. Thesetwo men experienced a Cuba prior to Castro's revolution, and in revolutionaryCuba, their lives altered forever. Another interviewee, Nina, was a generationyounger and grew up in Havana under Castro's rule. She did not want to leaveCuba, but eventually did so as a young adult when frustrated by the hardships.Our informant Daniel, who was just a few years younger than Nina, migrated tothe United States at age seven with his parents in the Mariel boatlift. [15]© 2009 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 10(3), Art. 13, Robin Cooper, Denese Edsall, Diana Riviera, Julia Chaitin & J.P. Linstroth:"My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South FloridaThis article summarizes these different lives and interprets how our biographersconceptualize their sense of belonging in relation to their immigrant experiencesfrom Cuba to the United States. [16]3.1.1 Victor's storyWhen asked to tell his life story, Victor immediately introduced the traumaticimpact of the Castro revelation. He begins his story, "Oh, well, I was very happyin my country until the revolution; you know; they make laws until I didn't like it,and I have to leave my country and leave my family." Victor's thoughts returnrepeatedly to the impact of Castro on his life. Speaking of his childhood, Victorsays, "It's happy, it's normal, like a child, like every child. Very, very happy withmy family, loving parents, loving brothers and sisters." Then, after a long breath,he says"And we have to get separate because of the system, the new system ... I was sohappy. I was born in a fishing town. The ocean was very close; I like to swim, play likeevery boy. ... Just the system changed, and everything changed you know, in my life,and the life of all my family and the many families in Cuba ..." [17]Victor explains that he was prohibited from pursuing abstract art, which was veryimportant to him. In addition, he was a practicing Catholic, and he said he wassent to a labor camp to work in the sugar cane fields for several years because "Iwas religious" and also in order to get a permit to leave the country. Victorreceived a visa to Spain, and after a short time he traveled to New York City.While he was able to see family members who had immigrated before him to theUnited States, it was painful for him to leave family members behind in Cuba, aswell. Victor's experience of leaving Cuba was clearly traumatic, even though hewas not expelled from the country. As he explained, he chose to work towardemigration by toiling on a sugar cane plantation for years in order to gain thedesired exit visa. Thus, he both wanted to leave and resented "having" to leave. [18]When describing his experience as an immigrant in the United States, Victorconveys similarly conflicted feelings."When I get New York, I am going to tell you the truth; I didn't like it at all. I wanted tocome back to Spain because New York was very different to our culture. But I havemy family, I have my girlfriend waiting for me, and then I decided to stay in thiscountry. That time it was hard because you don't get any help at all. ... My family helpme, but I like to have my own money. I started working. I work very hard. I didn'tspeak any English at all, but I got a job cleaning a bar. I have to work at five in themorning and take the subway and make a change in Times Square...I got lost manytimes in that Times Square. It was very hard, but after that I got another job, I getmarried, and everything was changing. I started loving this country I love now verymuch. And then after that I didn't like the cold weather. After four years there, wecame to Florida on vacation. I love this weather; I love this state, and in six month ...we move over here, and I start a new life here in Florida. It's still not that easybecause ... you have to work and you have to pay for everything. I repeat, I start© 2009 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 10(3), Art. 13, Robin Cooper, Denese Edsall, Diana Riviera, Julia Chaitin & J.P. Linstroth:"My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Floridaloving this country I still love a lot. And now I'm floral designer here and it's my actualjob, and I feel very good." [19]Victor speaks of Cuba as "my country" and of the United States as "this country."However his sense of belonging and home is more complex than these verbalcues would indicate. He disliked the United States at first and found it difficult toadjust. Nevertheless, he uses the word love several times to convey his currentfeelings for "this country." It appears that Victor harbors doubts about his choiceto leave Cuba. The emphasis on loving the United States and Florida mayindicate an effort to convince himself he made the right choice. At the same time,it might also reflect a genuine appreciation for the positive aspects of his life inAmerica. Therefore, we suggest Victor experiences both seemingly contradictoryfeelings simultaneously, thus leading to an ambivalent sense of belonging. [20]3.1.2 Martin's storyMartin was born in 1955 and is a contemporary of Victor, but he did not leaveCuba until 1988. Martin was imprisoned for several years for his political viewsprior to his emigration and he told us that he was always interested in politicalissues. By the time he was 17: "the State's Security began watching me, and theythought that I could harm the government because I thought differently, and I hadcourage to stand by my principles." Knowing he was being followed and indanger, Martin attempted to escape Cuba by sneaking onto a merchant ship. Thisescape attempt failed when the captain of the ship turned him in. He wassubsequently condemned to eight years in prison. [21]Martin explains pressure from the Catholic Church led to the liberation of manypolitical prisoners and he was among the fortunate ones. While he was trying toarrange his departure from the island, he was re-arrested for both possessingenemy propaganda and trying to escape and was sentenced to 20 years inprison. Martin was released in 1988 due to international pressure on Cuba torelease political prisoners. Speaking of his immigration to the United States,Martin says,"I came with the illusion to be a savior ... with that desire of continuing to fight forCuba's freedom, for the things that one believes in. But ... at the same time, whenyou come by yourself, to a country it is so hard, you live with no knowing thelanguage, without knowing the city. You don't know anything. You have to start fromscratch; it's very hard. I've worked very hard. Thank God, never I've had to ask thegovernment for aid. I've never felt inferior to Americans or anyone else. And, really,I've done well ... because I've worked hard, because I'm a serious person and believethat every day will be better. I have worked very hard. I'm a bus driver with Dade-County. I'm not doing bad, and I'm well off! I've never blamed this country because Isee that people come here blaming this country. They criticize what is bad with thiscountry. When I had it bad it was because I had no luck or because I was lazy orbecause of personal problems not because the country did not provide me with theopportunity." [22]© 2009 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 10(3), Art. 13, Robin Cooper, Denese Edsall, Diana Riviera, Julia Chaitin & J.P. Linstroth:"My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South FloridaMartin echoes Victor's emphasis on the need to work hard and also emphasizesthe success he ultimately achieved in the United States. As he continued hisstory, Martin spoke of his admiration for the democracy of the United States. Hespecifically discussed the free press and the freedom to criticize the president asbeing something he cherished. He also noted that Cubans will not have politicalconversations on the phone because they have been "programmed" to believethe State is tapping their phone lines. Martin commented,"This country gives you the possibility for you to grow, whatever they say ... Chaplinused to say that motherland is where you work, had freedom, and lived. Well, I don'tknow. I don't think that this is my motherland but that Cuba is my motherland. But itcould be when I go back that Cuba is not going to be the same." [23]Martin's reflections on Cuban identity indicated both pride and disappointment."I believe that us Cubans, we are a little hard to deal with, but I have never feltinferior. I am seeing the people that have come not so many years ago are not thesame people that came here in '59. Is not the same; is a different world. [Castro]wanted to create a new order. According to him ... everything that was refined oreverything that rich people liked or everything that was liked by the bourgeoisie wassomething nauseating, it was something bad. That's why ... all those refined thingswent on a downward spiral because they began changing an order that was a bitbourgeois to the so-called proletariat order of the workers. The women were dressedas militia men and would cut sugar cane and worked in construction because womenwere the same as men. And all of that brought about a liberalization, a vulgarity, atremendous low neighborhood vulgarity ... that's why for me Cubans are not thesame. For example, my nephew came who an airhead, and he came with ideas...istelling me things, thinking that what he was telling me I was going to see him as ahero. He doesn't know that what he was telling me is that he was an idiot and that hewas a person that was no good that was worthless. 'Cause for me, anyone who tellsme that he is a gigolo and all those things, I can't see those things as good ...The first Cubans, they were really the wealthy Cuban class that had to flee the island,the cultural class and the people who opposed the regime and the militaries from theprevious regime. Those people ... were brilliant people—entrepreneurs, physicians,etc. ... those people have a tremendous merit because they were the first that had towash dishes over here, the people whose children later on went to college. ...That isthe old Cuban-ness ... I don't think that Cubans who come now are going to createanything. It's already created. And it's an old Cuban-ness that inserted itself in a worldof democracy, in a world of North American development, but with the spirit and theCuban essence ... I think Cuba is a creature very, what I suspect is terrible. Thosesame Cubans that say over here, 'I go over there,' that's a lie, that's an ideal. Thereare thinkers that say that there is a Cuba in the mind; in reality, that doesn't existanymore. In reality, that Cuba beautiful, that doesn't exist. Those people havedestroyed our homeland."

Linstroth:"My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Florida3.1.3 Nina's storyWhile Nina was born a generation after Victor and Martin, she frames her lifestory in the context of the Castro revolution. Nina describes what might be called"imagined memories." These are scenes and facts that she was too young torecall herself, but to which she relates as if they came from firsthand experience."The year that I was born is called año de la ofensiva revolucionaria [the year of therevolutionary offensive]. Why was it called like that? Because it is the year when thelast existing private businesses in Cuba are nationalized. That means that the peoplewho had little businesses like bodegas ... a stand at the corner, it was over, and allthe people from that moment on work for the government. Then this means thatbetween '59 and '68 there was space for certain things which still remained, frombefore the revolution, from what was the life before. But little by little that was overwith. ... I was born in Hijas de Galicia, and in this clinic, the doctor who was supposedto take care of me who was there all the time ... this doctor who my mama my familyhas paid that he attends me when my mama was going to deliver me, he could notattend me, because they had sent him to work in agriculture. It was not some sort ofpunishment or anything like that, it was because, it was the time when they said thateverybody had to do work of the common man. So then when they put a doctor intoagriculture of course when the doctor arrived, he said to my mama, look I arrived, Iam in the city but I cannot attend you because two days ago I was on the fields andmy nails are full of dirt. A doctor cannot attend in a delivery with nails full of dirt; withall the washing of my hands I still have the dirt there." [25]Nina's memories of her birth and of the early years of the revolution are inheritedmemories. This indicates her Cuban identity has been constructed, in part, fromaccounts of Cuba told to her by relatives and learned through historical accounts.This continues in her memories of her childhood home in Havana."I lived in the center of Havana in a street called Amistad which is right next to thecapital. Havana has a capitol looking like the capitol in Washington; they made it verysimilar. Well I lived four blocks away from that. And that was the house of the familyof my father's side. The 10 brothers and sisters my grandmother had they were therein that house. But my whole family all the brothers and sisters of my grandmotherexcept for herself and another sister came to live in the United States when therevolution began ... It was one of these houses in Havana or like in Mexico too whichhave all the rooms one after another, which have a central patio and all the roomsone after another. For me this was a very big house ... because the only ones wholived there were my papa, my mama, and ... it was like a ghost house you could hearmany sounds ... I was raised ... in that house. I never liked the house. I liked itbecause it was my house, but always, when I look back it has an aura of a housewhere everybody was left, because all the rooms stayed the same, all the furniturestayed the same ... and it seemed like the people were still there. With time, thethings were taken down, they were changed. The things of the rooms were given toother needy families or other members of the family, but in the beginning the housewas like when they left, identical, the only thing was that they did not live thereanymore."

Linstroth:"My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South FloridaAlthough Nina expresses both being drawn to and fear of her childhood home,she recalls the city of Havana with great affection and nostalgia. As shedescribed it, "I know Havana where I can walk with closed eyes." Nina's fathertaught at night, and she and her mother spent many evenings walking throughthe city. Nina says of that time,"The city had still that soul of a beautiful city. In that moment I didn't realize it,because for me it was a normal city, but there was certain things that you still couldsee like the places where you got in, the lobbies with marble floors. Then these thingsstarted to get destroyed because the time is horrible, and if you don't maintain it ..." [27]Nina's story reflects both the loss of the city she loves and the loss of that city'sformer glory as a result of the revolution. [28]Nina's parents divorced during her childhood, and she remained very close to herfather. When he decided to leave Cuba, the family kept the decision a secret forhis protection. As a result, Nina experienced the shock of sudden separationwhen she learned he was gone."In ... 1980, my father left. My father that I loved left the country in the year 1980 withthe Mariel boatlift ... My dad and my mom had divorced a year earlier. I didn't live withhim, but I was very attached to him. The circumstances of the day in which my fatherleft were horrible. My father didn't tell anybody but only ... his mom and his father thathe was leaving. He didn't tell me that he was leaving the country. So imagine, I gothat afternoon to see my grandmother, and then I arrived to the house and my fatheris there. And I asked papi, what are you doing here? Well, a day of work, howcurious. And I sit with my father to talk with him. At that time I miss him morebecause I don't live with him, but I continue see him. So I see that papi gives memany kisses and he is rare, rare. And I thought, what is going on with him? We sat ina sofa, and I told him, papi you are giving me a kiss like if you would never see meagain. In that time the country is in convulsion...with all people who want leave andothers who don't. Papi has all this situation with me of kiss and kiss because...heknows that he is leaving, but I don't know. ... So Monday ... morning, my maternalgrandmother starts to say your father left the country, your father left ..." [29]Clearly, the departure of her father was painful for Nina. Her own decision toleave Cuba was also emotional, though it was anger which prompted her resolve.She told us she "didn't want to leave Cuba." At the same time, however, Nina wasgrowing increasingly frustrated over her deteriorating quality of life. Her boyfriendpredicted that economic hardship would increase with the coming of perestroikain Russia, and he encouraged Nina to take advantage of the opportunity she hadto join her father in Florida. In fact, Nina was able to leave because her father hadgained citizenship in the United States while she was still a minor: "I decide toleave in September of '89. The summer of '89 was very sad, very sad, very sad,because, imagine, you separate from everything. Curiously, instead of being sad,what I had inside was ...a big anger that I had to leave my country. A veryaggressive thing, I took everything in a very aggressive way." Similar to Victor,Nina speaks of having to leave her country. Nina made the decision to leave, with© 2009 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 10(3), Art. 13, Robin Cooper, Denese Edsall, Diana Riviera, Julia Chaitin & J.P. Linstroth:"My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Floridathe encouragement of her boyfriend, who saw her growing desperation andunhappiness in Cuba. However, she still perceives herself as having been forcedto leave. [30]Nina originally thought of Miami as "horrible." However, her appreciation for thecity grew when she traveled to Spain to reunite with her boyfriend. "When I am inSpain I miss Miami, I start to see Miami with other eyes." In addition, due to thelarge Cuban community in South Florida, Nina saw little need to speak Englishand acculturate. [31]While Nina eventually became a United States citizen, this legal status has notaltered her sense of Cuban identity. According to Nina, being Cuban is anunconscious phenomenon:"Every day, I don't question myself if I am a Cuban because that is what I am. I mean,I wake up in the morning and I drink Cuban coffee, I eat Cuban food. Everything whatI do is Cuban, but it is not a conscientious thing." [32]In spite of her new citizenship, Nina does not think of herself as American:"I behave always, respecting the way of living of the Americans. ... We have theirlaws, we do everything we have to do, but in our private life we are Cuban. I try not to,that my Cuban part doesn't die." [33]In her interview, Nina made a distinction between Cubans who emigrated fromCuba and Cuban Americans who were born in the United States to Cubanparents. In other words, she does not understand those born in the United Statesto be full Cubans, in spite of their Cuban ethnicity. She reserves Cuban identityfor those born on the island. [34]3.1.4 Daniel's storyWhen Daniel was 7, he came to the United States in the Mariel boatlift with hisparents. He remembers aspects of Cuban life under Castro, such as thenationalism expressed at his school. Daniel does not have direct memories of hismigration. Most of Daniel's memories have been constructed with informationreceived from relatives and other sources. He repeats what might be consideredthe standard discourse of the exile community. For example:"I came to this country when I was only about seven years old, so I don't have a lot ofmemories, very distinctive memories. I do know I didn't have a lot of abundance. Iwas raised in a land that once flourished in the 1950s. However, when I was born inthe 1972 post-Castro era, there started to be more scarcity and less freedoms as faras freedom of speech and so forth." [35]The most prominent feature of Daniel's memories of Cuba is his father's experi-ence. Daniel was both proud and somewhat defensive about this aspect of hispast, because his father worked as a high-level government official under Castro.© 2009 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 10(3), Art. 13, Robin Cooper, Denese Edsall, Diana Riviera, Julia Chaitin & J.P. Linstroth:"My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Florida"My father was a highly intelligent person who had a lot of merits, also an economistand also accountant. He actually ascended up through the ranks. He wasappointed ... well I don't want to talk too much about that. Bottom line, he didn't havetoo much of a say. If you have a lot to offer as far as your intelligence, you have someexpertise in particular areas in what the government or Castro appoints, you can't sayno regardless of what your family thinks or feels. It would be a lot worse for you, soregardless of personal views, that's the way that works." [36]Daniel relates when discussing his father's difficulties in Cuba that some people"were sent to beat him [his father] up and whatever else, discard him." Danielsaid his father's past good conduct led people to protect him and help him toescape the island with his wife and son. He notes, "There is things I don't knowstill till today, because he wouldn't talk about it." As Daniel recalled the day hisfamily left Cuba, he relived the farewells and emotions: "Everybody cried, andhugs I still feel today and my grandparents, I couldn't breathe." He remembersthinking he was just going on vacation and wondered why his relatives were sosad. Daniel's portrayal of Cuba includes some happy memories of playing with hisgrandfather in his childhood home, but Cuba seems largely a shadowy place.Both the sense of threat and possible shame darken the playful childhoodimages. [37]Daniel speaks of his father with great respect and admiration. He frames theirimmigration experience in the context of his father sacrificing a white collarposition in order to give his son "the dream of America, you know the greatestcountry on earth." Daniel expresses pride in his American citizenship andidentifies strongly with the ideal of the American dream. Although he asserts thathe is also proud of his "Cuban roots and culture." He identifies South Florida as"home" and throughout the interview embraces the diversity of the region. [38]3.2 Second generation immigrantsTwo of the participants, Lisa and Yolanda were born in the United States. Theyhave "Cuban memories" from their parents and grandparents. These second-generation Cuban Americans told us they were acutely aware of the sense of lossfelt by their parents. Although the women did not identify with a sense of loss ornostalgia themselves, they assert these forces played a strong presence in theirlives. Their sense of belonging reflects attachment to their families rather than tothe island of Cuba. At the same time, the women find their families' focus onCuba oppressive; and they yearn to "migrate" to freedom in their own way. [39]3.2.1 Lisa's storyLisa was born in 1977. Her mother emigrated from Cuba on a Freedom Flight atage 11 with her parents and younger sister. According to her story, this was aheart-breaking experience for Lisa's grandparents, whose own neighbors threweggs at them and called them traitors as they left. Lisa told us, "My dad cameanother way; I don't want to specifically say, but he came another way when hewas 25." Later she referred to the fact that her father had been in prison for© 2009 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 10(3), Art. 13, Robin Cooper, Denese Edsall, Diana Riviera, Julia Chaitin & J.P. Linstroth:"My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Floridaopposing the Castro regime. He had escaped and stowed away on a Dutch cargoship, hiding in a cavity of the ship where ropes were stored. [40]Lisa constructs her Cuban identity through her family:"My memories or my interaction with Cuban culture has just been through them; I'venever stepped on Cuba, never seen Cuba ... Whenever I say I'm Cuban, Iimmediately follow that saying, oh no my parents are Cuban. I was born here. Ialways do that. ... With me it's ... the hyphenated Cuban-American more ... becausethe Cuban side is more like I said ... it's more an identity of what my parents gaveme." [41]She gives an example how this hyphenated perspective is expressed throughfood. The family celebrates Thanksgiving with a turkey and yams because it isthe traditional American meal. However, to reflect their Cuban heritage, they adda leg of pork. Her strongest impressions of Cuba come through her grandfather,who she refers to as "old school" and who considers Cuba a "sacred land." Whenshe was a little girl, he gave her sugarcane stalks to suck on as a taste of Cuba,and taught her how to kill a chicken. On the other hand, she told us how hermother remembered President Kennedy's assassination, and so her familyidentifies with certain iconic moments of American history, as well. [42]Lisa does not strongly identify with a Cuban ethnicity nor does she feel a strongconnection to Cuban national identity. She comments on the fact that it makes nodifference to her whether someone is from Puerto Rico or Cuba or Mexico. She isbemused by the tendency of older Cuban immigrants to feel a bond with herwhen they learn of her Cuban ancestry."There's parts of me that feels Cuban or what I think is Cuban. My identity that I knowis from my family, and you know just things from the media. It's entertainment; halfthe time I can't really tell if they're having a Cuban accent or not. To me it's just aSpanish accent ... I can never tell who's Puerto Rican or who's from Mexico ... I'mvery bad at that, and when they tell me, I'm like, whatever. I've had a lot of peopleconfuse me for Puerto Rican and I'm like, no I'm Cuban, and they're like, oh I'm sosorry. I'm like, I don't care, whatever. ... I even get it at work a lot of times 'causewhere I work there's a lot of Spanish people but from all over. ... They're looking atme because my Spanish is very Americanized, and they ... say, where you from. Andthen if I say I'm Cuban, and they are Cuban, forget about it ... they start talking to meand they ask me where my parents are from and I'm like, wait a minute. Am Isupposed to give you a prize because we are from the same ethnicity? All of thesudden their eyes bloom, and they feel like they have this connection with me. ...Ethnicity wise, I don't see a great connection. Sometimes in the back of my mindsomeone says I'm Cuban, it's kind of like oh ok, but then it dies ... I don't get thatinstant connection. I get it, but to me it to me it's not that important." [43]Lisa also differentiated her own sense of ethnicity with the national identity of herfather. She noted how she learned of her ancestry from Venezuela, France, andSpain. And even though her father was born to Venezuelan parents who had© 2009 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 10(3), Art. 13, Robin Cooper, Denese Edsall, Diana Riviera, Julia Chaitin & J.P. Linstroth:"My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Floridaimmigrated to Cuba, he continues to stress his Cuban identity. Lisa contrasts thisstrong identification with Cuban identity, saying,"I'm just American. It's just the threads of the makeup of my past and my parents'past that make me who I am; it's the mixture of the French and the Spaniard and theCuban and the Venezuelan and then all of the things that made them, the places theywere and the experiences that made them what they are today, and whateverreligious things get tied to it and then any cultural things." [44]Lisa is somewhat defensive about the United States when her Cuban relativescriticize it."The only thing of Cuba I have is through the stories and the rantings of mygrandparents and my father. Of course the worst thing you could do at any Cubangathering is mention the word Cuba, and there's a good three-hour argument. ... I getmad a lot of times because they always compare things from Cuba, but they arecomparing things—Cuba 1950s to here—how better it was in Cuba. I always say, ifyou went back now you wouldn't recognize the place, and I go stop-stop-stopbumming on this country that you've come to." [45]While Lisa identifies with the United States as her homeland, she still refers to itin this excerpt as "this county" and does not feel at home in South Florida: "I don'twanna live here anymore. I don't see myself, I can't see myself here." Sheaspires to move to Denver with her husband and likens her parents' andgrandparents' decision to leave Cuba with her own desire to leave South Florida."I feel like the black sheep 'cause I want to leave. I live in Broward, and they live inDade, but I want to move. I want to move up north; I want to move to Denver. That'swhere me and my husband want to go, and to them it's like I'm destroying the family.I try to tell them, well, wait a minute you immigrated here. But then its like ooh, wewere under persecution. I want to take the chance to better myself. I don't see ithappening here. ... I gotta figure out what's best for me." [46]3.2.2 Yolanda's storyLike Lisa, Yolanda was born in the United States, but with far less connections tothe cultural artifacts of "Cuban-ness." She has empathy for the trauma her fatherexperienced as a Cuban refugee, but she also feels he is in denial about hispossibility of returning to the island."My dad says that he had a good house for the family back in Cuba, but he and mymom and my older brother and sister had to leave everything behind. Castro's regimeexpropriated the house that belonged to my parents. I think my dad neverrecuperated from the loss, and he refuses to buy any property in the United States.He only hopes to go back home to his beloved Cuba. I do not feel the same. WhenCastro dies I will go to Cuba and will visit my aunts, uncles and cousins; but I don'tfeel as Cubans born in the island feel, like one day they will go back to claim what istheirs. My dad never says it, but I think he is waiting some day to go back and claim© 2009 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 10(3), Art. 13, Robin Cooper, Denese Edsall, Diana Riviera, Julia Chaitin & J.P. Linstroth:"My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Floridahis house and the farm he lost over thirty years ago. That is a long time to wait forsomething that will never be his again ever! The older generation of Cubans...still actand think like refugees ... Many Cubans including my parents and the majority of theirfriends blame the United States for their long stay in this country. They feel they don'tbelong in here. Some of them do not speak English, and some others includingyoung people refuse to learn English. For example, if you go to little Havana, youhave the impression that you are in another country. People speak and act like if theywere in one of the streets from Cuba ... I avoid that area as much as I can. It is toomuch for me. I like the peace and quiet ... I am stressed ... as it is, I don't need thenoisy Cubans." [47]Yolanda repeatedly refers to "Cubans" as a group to which she does not belong.She says even though she is North American, she has to listen to discussions ofCuba because her family is from Cuba. She says she regularly eats Cuban food,but sometimes gets bored and eats sushi."Don't get me wrong, even though I don't feel like a Cuban I still like Cuban people.Many of my friends are Cuban. I like the food, the parties, the way they enjoy life,their work ethics, and one day I will like to visit Cuba. To anybody that asks me whereI am from I always mention my Cuban ancestry; I am very proud of it ... If I have kidsin the future I would like to teach them Spanish and talk to them about their Cubanheritage; I think it is important to have roots and a sense of belonging to differentcultures." [48]Yolanda simultaneously asserts while she does not feel Cuban, she is nonethe-less proud of her Cuban ancestry. She may not yearn for Cuba as her fatherdoes, but she is haunted by unfulfilled dreams of her own. She feels her desiresto be a singer and artist have been stifled and prohibited by her father, who sherefers to several times as a very strict "Cuban father." At the time of the interview,she was living with her parents in an apartment, but expressed hopes ofestablishing a home of her own at some point outside of Miami-Dade County. [49]As these interviews highlight, our informants' notions of Cuban identity and homereflect complex and divergent perspectives. These biographers from both the firstand second generations convey multiple aspects of what it means to be Cuban inAmerica. A common thread among these interviews, however, is the livedexperience of ambivalent belonging. It is this theme we explore more fully below.When summing up our results concerning the sense of belonging to a Cubanidentity, we found the second generation did not express a strong national orethnic Cuban identity. Perhaps the young women who were interviewed for ourstudy are simply too far removed in time from the revolution that took place 50years ago to feel an emotional connection to the trauma of separation from theCuban nation. They told us they feel American. The women also appear to beconflicted about the degree of Cuban-ness they feel or want to embrace. Theyembrace the notion of the American dream, and often feel their Cuban parentsare preventing the fulfillment of those dreams. Their Cuban identity consistslargely of symbolic ethnicity expressed in food and music. The women speakSpanish, but confess it is "Americanized." Although he was born in Cuba, Daniel,© 2009 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 10(3), Art. 13, Robin Cooper, Denese Edsall, Diana Riviera, Julia Chaitin & J.P. Linstroth:"My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Floridawho came to the United States at age seven, also conveys a strong sense ofAmerican identity, placing him in between the first and second generation. Inspite of the differing emphasis placed on identity and what it means to be Cuban,Daniel and the second generation immigrants all express pride in their Cubanheritage and a desire for their own children to learn Spanish and to be connectedto the culture of their past. Clearly, there is no single Cuban identity; rather,individuals subjectively construct and experience multiple, evolving notions ofCuban identity. We explore this notion more fully below. [50]4. Discussion and Conclusions4.1 Ambivalence regarding leavingCHAITIN, LINSTROTH, and HILLER's introductory article in this issue, whichprovides an overview of the larger study from which our sub-sample was drawn,notes the experience of immigration is often accompanied by stress and a senseof contradiction and ambiguity. This is due to the opportunities afforded byimmigration combined with estrangement from the homeland. [51]One dominant theory of migration relies on this notion of duality in theimmigration experience by using a push and pull model to explain why migrantsleave one country and move to another. This theory suggests "the 'push' ofdiminishing opportunities and the 'pull' of new ones" function to motivateimmigration (PEDRAZA-BAILEY, 1985, p.5). When one considers refugees, thefactors contributing to the push to leave may be political as well as economic.MAINGOT (1992) has outlined how such structural forces have affected the pushand pull of migration specifically for immigrants from the Caribbean Basin. [52]In the stories of the Cuban immigrants analyzed for this article, we saw evidenceof pushing and pulling influences that contributed to their decisions to leaveCuba. We suggest this duality contributed to ambivalence among our participantsregarding the phenomenon of leaving. Those who emigrated felt forced to leavetheir homeland, although they were not literally expelled; this was a choice theymade to better their lives. As a result, these first generation immigrants conveythe conflicting feelings of loss over leaving a homeland, combined with the desireto leave for a better life. They feel resentment over being "forced" to leave, butthey simultaneously feel the conflicting feeling of gratitude over having escapedthe oppressive Castro regime. For the second-generation participants, leaving isassociated with leaving the immediate family, which is strongly identified withCuban tradition and the Cuban community. These participants want to escape theoppression of Cuban family expectations, while at the same time they feel theconflicting feeling of valuing close family ties. [53]Based on our analyses, we suggest that the push and pull theory of migration canbe expanded beyond consideration of political and economic factors to includepsychological and emotional factors. We also suggest the duality of push and pullfeelings associated with immigration, which we characterize as ambivalence, arefelt long after the decision is made to leave the country. First-generation© 2009 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 10(3), Art. 13, Robin Cooper, Denese Edsall, Diana Riviera, Julia Chaitin & J.P. Linstroth:"My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Floridaimmigrants continue to feel an emotional push and pull, simultaneous andconflicted feelings about their decision to leave, in some cases for decadesfollowing the actual migration experience. Second-generation immigrants remainaffected by their parents' experience and their desire to maintain close contact inthe aftermath of separation, yet they also yearn to make their own migrationsaway from what they perceive as a suffocating grip by their parents. [54]4.2 Ambivalent sense of homeCHAITIN, LINSTROTH, and HILLER's article (this issue) points out why notionsof home and homeland carry multiple connotations of meanings, identities, andmemories; the authors also remark upon the context of immigration, and how thesignificance of home varies for different generations. We draw upon thisrecognition and explanation of dialectal and ambiguous aspects of home toconsider the sense of home specifically among our Cuban-American biographers.While scholars in the field of Cuban-American studies have pointed to an"American ambivalence" toward the presence of immigrants in Americancommunities, we argue why the immigrants themselves also feel and expressambivalence toward feeling at home in these communities (STEPICK, GRENIER,CASTRO & DUNN, 2003, p.11). [55]Some scholars suggest many Cuban immigrants may no longer intend to returnto Cuba even after Castro and this means "the United States is their home, notCuba" (OLSEN & OLSEN, 1995, p.109). This assertion belies the stories of ourfirst-generation informants, who expressed much more complex and conflictedsentiments regarding what and where home is for them. Whether or not first-generation Cuban immigrants actually expect to return to the island, or willeventually do so, they may consider themselves "reluctant migrants" whocontinue to view Cuba as home (PEREZ, 1992, p.93). In addition, for thoseresiding in Miami, the large and dominant Cuban presence makes possible adaily existence largely conducted in Spanish among fellow Cuban immigrants.Such an environment might be considered a liminal space—not quite Cuba, notquite the United States. This liminality contributes to ambiguity about home. [56]The perceptions of changes in post-revolutionary Cuba have also fostered asense of ambivalence about Cuba as home among the first-generationimmigrants. There is a belief the Castro revolution destroyed an ideal, beautifultropical island homeland. While the communist ideology and economic systemhas transformed the "real" Cuba into a physically damaged and morally decayingcountry. Of course, this "real" Cuba is an imagined construct, as one of ourbiographers stated: it exists in the mind only. This finding is reflected byFOURON and GLICK-SCHILLER's assertion (2002, pp.168-169) that immigrantsoften dream of a "dear, sweet homeland," a fiction non-existent in actualmemories. [57]The first-generation immigrants in our sample also expressed the simultaneous,conflicting feelings of ambivalence in regards to the United States as a newhome. Their notions of ethnic difference co-exist with an appreciation for freedom© 2009 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 10(3), Art. 13, Robin Cooper, Denese Edsall, Diana Riviera, Julia Chaitin & J.P. Linstroth:"My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Floridaof speech and the economic opportunity characterized as the American dream.PORTES and STEPICK (1993, p.149) assert Cuban immigrants developed arelationship to the United States through rejecting the discourse of "minority" andadopting the discourse of the "success story." CASTRO (2000, p.306) suggeststheir espousal of the success story "fuels Cuban accomplishments; from it flowCuban-American pride and self-confidence and, too often, anger, arrogance, andintolerance, as well." We believe the discourse of achievement also impacted thesense of home among these immigrants. By identifying with the nationalmythology of the American dream, they have been able to feel somewhat athome in American culture, while simultaneously feeling as outsiders. [58]It is furthermore important to recall here the role of such structural influences asarchitecture and Spanish-language street names as described in our socio-historical context of Cuban immigration (PEREZ, 1999). U.S. construction ofgovernment and commercial buildings and housing developments in Cuba in thetwentieth century, and Cuban-inspired architecture and street names in greaterMiami, caused Cuban immigrants to find the Miami environment simultaneouslyforeign and familiar. This resonance of cultural familiarity may have helped manyCuban immigrants to appreciate living in South Florida and to feel at home. Whilefor most of them, their emotional homeland is the Cuban island. [59]Our results showed why second-generation immigrants' sense of home isconflicted, but in different ways than their parents and grandparents. RUMBAUT(2002) discusses the impact of first-generation immigrants' sense of home andbelonging on their children. He asks whether the sense of belonging their parentsfeel toward the ancestral homeland"are sustained in the generation of their children, particularly those born here wholack the memories and metaphorical birth connection of their emigrant parents.Where is home—or perhaps homes—for the second generation? Do they imaginethemselves in multiple sites of belonging? Are they able to lead dual lives or tomaintain dual frames of reference? Are they even interested?" (2002, p.46). [60]Other researchers, such as Diane WOLF (1997, p.459), speak of "emotionaltransnationalism" as a term that captures this sense of attachment to a homelandfor second-generation immigrants. She suggests while there may be less of anattachment to the imagined homeland, second-generation immigrantsnonetheless understand "home" in a nostalgic way. HERRERA (2007) appliesthis line of thought specifically to second-generation Cuban immigrants, arguinghow these Cuban-Americans know Cuba only through inherited memories. [61]Based on our interviews, however, we found the second-generation Cubanimmigrants in our study did not feel personally connected to Cuba as home, andsaw Cuba as the homeland of their parents and grandparents, while they, thechildren, identify with the United States as their own homeland. It may be theinability of second-generation Cuban Americans to travel to the ancestralhomeland has prevented the formation of these emotional ties and imaginednostalgia. For second-generation immigrants from other countries, especially© 2009 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 10(3), Art. 13, Robin Cooper, Denese Edsall, Diana Riviera, Julia Chaitin & J.P. Linstroth:"My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South Floridathose who are able to move back and forth between two countries, such travelmay foster a genuine transnationalism. Instead of nostalgia, the second-generation biographers indicated a constant reference to and repetition of Cubanhistory by first-generation Cubans was somewhat oppressive. They soughtdistance from the notion of Cuba as home. These participants spoke of theirappreciation for their families and for what they have experienced, but at times,they also find life with their families suffocating. They seek to establishindependent homes, which will require deviating from family expectationsassociated with Cuban tradition. [62]4.3 Ambivalent identityCuban identity is a topic of extreme importance for the immigrant community inthe United States. It is also a contested idea, due in part to the varyingexperiences of those arriving in the United States during the different waves ofmigration. As mentioned above, regarding the ideal of Cuba Libre (free Cuba)has existed in the imagination for centuries as an unrealized dream. In light of thisunique history, Cuba has been referred to as "the elusive nation" (FERNANDEZ& BETANCOURT, 2000, p.3). Scholars have argued why Cuban-ness itself isassociated with "incompleteness, impossibility, loss, and disenchantment"(FERNANDEZ & BETANCOURT, 2000, p.8). DUANY (2000) has pointed to whythe perception of Cuban-ness is not American. CASTRO posits how the exilecommunity "believes that it is a repository and trustee of what is most authentic inCuban culture, which, in its view, has been virtually destroyed on the island bynearly four decades of communism" (2000, p.306). This exile communityattempts to pass this Cuban culture on to the second generation, but thisconstruction of Cuban culture and identity does not acknowledge the inevitablechanges taking place within every culture. This is a point that MEDINAemphasizes in pointing to the "illusion of uniqueness or singularity" of Cubanidentity, an illusion that does not take into account the diversity and contestednature of that national identity (2007, p.3). [63]This sense of loss brings us to the issue of trauma. VOLKAN (1991, p.13) speaksof "chosen trauma" when referring to experiences of victimization and humiliationas factors in the construction of a collective identity. We contend why thisconceptualization is useful in understanding various expressions of Cubanidentity. The first generation of Cuban immigrants who participated in this studyexperienced trauma in the process of leaving the island, and specifically conveyhow suffering is linked to Castro's regime. This trauma remained at the forefrontof their construction of their own identities; indeed it was the first thing theymentioned when they began telling the stories of their lives. While it isunderstandable any trauma would leave a permanent impression in someone'sconsciousness, these immigrants chose to identify with this political trauma. Itappears to be a unifying element of Cuban exiles in South Florida for creatingcommunal identity. The first-generation immigrants chose to maintain this traumaas the central facts of their collective Cuban identity.

Linstroth:"My Country" / "This Country": Ambivalent Belongings of Cuban Americans in South FloridaChosen trauma may also carry over from first-generation to second-generationimmigrants where "there is an unconscious expectation that the next generationwill complete both the task of mourning and the reversal of humiliation" (VOLKAN& ITZKOWITZ, 2000, p.233). The notion of second-generation "remembering,"referred to above, coincides with this idea that those who did not experience thetrauma will nonetheless feel traumatized as a result of hearing their parents'stories and memories (HERRERA, 2007). The theory of long distance nationalismsupports this notion, proposing "an ideology of belonging that extends across theterritorial boundaries of states, as well as across generational divides" (FOURON& GLICK-SCHILLER, 2002, p.170). On the other hand, RUMBAUT (2002, p.91)suggests that the second generation does not experience this trauma "over ahomeland that was never lost to them in the first place." Other scholars argue thateven if second-generation immigrants seek to maintain a national identity rootedin the ancestral homeland, a lessening of attachment inevitably occurs as a resultof the many little acts and decisions of everyday life in the country of residence(KASINITZ, WATERS, MOLLENKOPF & ANIL, 2002). [65]4.4 Concluding thoughtsIn the analysis and discussion above, we have focused on several aspects ofambivalence that emerged in the life stories of our Cuban biographers. We haveexplored differences among first- and second-generation Cuban immigrantsregarding what it means to leave or escape, what it means to be Cuban, andwhere home is found. These findings have led us to consider areas for potentialfurther research and exploration. [66]Based on our interpretations of the biographical interviews with the youngergeneration, we see initial indications in these interviews alluding to the potentialformation of a pan-Hispanic identity. While the older first-generation immigrantsidentify passionately with Cuba, the country of Cuba is important to the second-generation immigrants only as a place they would like to visit some day in order tomeet distant relatives. The second-generation immigrants identify more stronglywith the Spanish language and with a general Hispanic ethnicity. What is morethis research proves how ethnicity does not necessarily need to reflect a unifiedidentity for such groups as Cuban Americans. Generational differences as thoseamong Cuban Americans explain how ethnic forms of belonging may contradictone another, proving why identity formation is so complex and nuanced for anygroup. In fact, this may be the beginning of a new construction of a new variationof ambivalent identity and may bear fruit for further research. [67]ReferencesBenjamin, Jules R. (1990).
