      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>When you know how the EU machinery is working, then the process of
policymaking increasingly becomes a creative process.</p>
      <p>After the accession to the European Union in 2004 and 2007, political actors of
former communist countries are equally represented in all EU institutions. In
addition to the political level, a huge body of medium to high-level administrative
staff and lobbyists has moved to this specific European labour market. While
working as politicians, officials or lobbyists in the institutional structures of the EU,
these actors get in dept acquainted with the Brussels style of working and the
elaborated code of negotiation. At the same time, these experts maintain a
frequent and regular exchange with actors on the national level, thus forming a
specific “Brussels scene”.</p>
      <p>Since the beginning of accession negotiations at the end of the 1990s, all
categories of actors have been familiarized with the Brussels administrative arena
and the negotiating style. They were able to gain working experience in EU-related
line ministries, organisations and political committees. After a phase of
asymmetrical power constellations during the accession process, how can, after
2004, the real participation in the policy-making process in the enlarged EU of 25
Member States (EU-25) be characterized? How do the new participants of Central
and East European Member States (EU-8)1 act in the new surrounding, given that
all EU-institutions themselves are much more heterogeneous and in a process of
consolidation and adjustment? The year 2004 thus marked a new and at the same
time unique situation for old and new Member States alike2.</p>
      <p>Starting in 2004, negotiations for the Financial Perspective 2007-2013 with
implications for the EU Cohesion Policy and the Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP) have been on the agenda for two years. The results as to financial
arrangements did not fully meet the expectations of delegations of new Member
States. Nevertheless some financially minor, but innovative aspects forwarded by
actors of the EU-8 (by single delegations, by the group of EU-8 or by the Visegrád
group) were incorporated in the new regulations. So they were partially able to
carve out creative niches.</p>
      <p>
        In general, these lengthy negotiations were characterized by participants of the
new Member States as a “real learning area” and a “healthy ferment”3. This means
that inherent difficulties among the “newcomers” as well as misperceptions and
non-acceptance among old Member States were part of the game: On the one
hand, actors of the EU-8 did not yet possess of refined negotiation capacities and
capabilities which include an openness to cooperate with different partners and to
have a feeling for the necessary early mobilization and for active formal and
1 To avoid repetition, the labels Central and Eastern Europe and EU-8 are used interchangeably for
the new Member States of the accession round of 2004; the same applies to old Member States
and EU-15.
2 This means that the institutional and policy arrangements of the enlarged EU are not yet “locked
in” (Goetz 2006: 13) and that the European project is inherently in flux (Taggert/Szczerbiak 2004:
23).

European Union, Brussels, March 2007.
informal modes of participation. In addition, the demonstration of a sometimes too
strong self-confidence and self-assertion of outstanding actors of Central and East
European Member States could be mentioned: The Polish delegation is blamed for
an aggressive way of negotiating and of demonstrating a very national rhetoric as
to the Reform Treaty
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Lang 2006; Langenohl/Westphal 2007: 7ff.)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>On the other hand, the nature of established negotiation structures and codes of
conduct among old Member States made it difficult for newcomers to define and
find trustworthy partners: in the different EU institutions defenders of the status
quo were reluctant to open the structures of long-established “inner circles” based
on and built upon long-shared experience to new groups and communities. This
has effectively counteracted the smooth integration of newcomers and has
complicated the effective participation in existing patterns of decision-making
(Langenohl/Westphal 2006: 10). In consequence these factors have largely
hindered the emergence of inclusive modes of policy-making within different EU
Institutions.</p>
      <p>Finally, this leads to the perception that even several years after the accession still
asymmetrical forms of bargaining and negotiations can be seen and that,
indirectly, power differentials among Member States are portrayed4. In addition the
perception among EU-8 is that they see themselves as peripheral to their
negotiation partners.</p>
      <p>Now the Mid-term Evaluation of the Financial Perspective 2007-2013 is on top of
the agenda of actors of all EU-Institutions. This intergovernmental bargaining
process has again implications for the future orientation of financially most
significant policy fields such as the Common Agricultural Policy and Cohesion
Policy5 as well as for areas such as environment and the enlargement policy.
Therefore, the capacity for a clever and early positioning in these contexts has a
high relevance for the socio-economic context of Central and Eastern European
Member States of the EU.</p>
      <p>Given that newcomers could not yet fully exploit the possibilities of negotiations in
the policy-making process and their style of lobbying, negotiating and bargaining
still is in need of a necessary fine-tuning, the aim of this paper is to highlight
constellations, in which actors of this Brussels scene were - although regarded as
a peripheral group - able through formal and informal exchange of knowledge to
act as promoters of the elaborated EU-inspired thinking and socio-economic
positioning. The analysis of this potential for mobilization is based on expert
interviews with Polish (and Hungarian) lobbyists, EU officials and Members of the
European Parliament (MEPs) carried through in spring and autumn of 2007 in
4 These structural mismatches are among other things expressed by hard facts such as by
grouping newcomers differently with regard to official charts and statistics: In the context of the
ECOFIN-Council there exist stability and convergence programmes for EU-15 (I) and EU-12 (II).
This means that the 12 new Member States are dealt with in “stability and convergence
programmes II”, although some of them are already part of the Euro zone (homepage of Council of
Ministers, 7 March 2008).

European-wide debate. At the same time, the national and regional absorption capacities of
funding frame the possibility for financially important follow-up programmes.
Brussels. The empirical analysis focus the EU cohesion policy due to its
crosssector potential: This means that cohesion policy involves environmental aspects,
enlargement and energy policy as well as the second pillar of CAP, the rural
development.</p>
      <p>Factors influencing the actual arena of negotiations are, firstly, whether
participants are - at a societal-cultural level - able to react in an adequate manner.
This personal disposition is based on working experience and the study
background, thus the level of socialisation in an international and
Europeanoriented context. To what extend does the new generation of staff already
represent modern diplomats for Europe? The second vector of influence is based
on the national background and on domestic politics: Which is the room of
manoeuvre for participants to act as promoter or transmitter? In other words, when
it comes to the contextualisation of actors’ behaviour the level of independence is
important: To which degree are persons involved able to speak in the name of the
EU-Institution and thus to transmit the philosophy of the relevant EU institution6?
To what extent does a general consensus among elites (and the public) exist that
EU membership is beneficial in the long run? To combine the factors: What kind of
coalitions are actors of the Brussels scene willing (personally) and able (externally
dominated or influenced) to form? These questions are coupled with the
necessary acceptance of the open-endedness of decision-making and the fact that
benefits are long-termed and somewhat abstract (Taggert/Szczerbiak 2004).
The expected outcome is the application of refined negotiation capacities which
include an openness for mutual dialogue and the ability to create incentives for a
consensual behaviour (in order to form coalitions), while being flexible and
dynamic. Thus a feeling for different, soft steering methods is needed, while
“having fun” to convince and to persuade. In addition, the willingness and ability to
argue out of the philosophy of the relevant EU institution is needed and part of the
game. In the context of transferring normative aspects, the capacity of actors to
easily intertwin policy fields and topics in a clever way is requested. In the field of
EU Cohesion Policy the willingness to promote instruments related to the Lisbon
Strategy is necessary. By using soft diplomacy, the EU personnel is able to
multivarietly adopt to the situation, to grasp the opportunities and finally to carve out
creative niches. Thereby, an increasingly European-oriented motivation of
promoters is manifesting both horizontally (among EU institutions) as well as in
vertical administrative contexts.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>Conceptual lenses</title>
      <p>Discussions in political science and sociology focus the consolidation phase of the
transformation process in combination with Europeanization or EU-ization
(Langenohl/Westphal 2007; Kutter/Trappmann 2006). These debates are also
applicable for the work in the new institutional structures of the European Union. In
addition, multi-level governance is the new game in town, which entails formal and
informal lobbying and negotiation mechanisms as well as soft forms of steering.
Actual fields of applications are the Lisbon Strategy including concepts such as the
6 Normative aspects e.g. of the EU Cohesion policy are embedded in the philosophy of EU
institutions and find expression in drafts and reports of cohesion policy’s regulations.
Open Method of Coordination (Tömmel 2006; Leiber 2007) as well as urban
governance (Marshall 2005).</p>
      <p>Sociological approaches refer to the notion of “tacit knowledge”, which goes back
to the work of Polanyi (1985): a “canon of knowledge” is forming an integral part of
the individual and social life. This canon not only entails explicit forms of
knowledge to be learnt, but also deep-rooted and prevailing forms of implicit
knowledge. This knowledge has the function to be an essential cultural frame in
the context of daily working and acting.</p>
      <p>“It is not only instrumental in helping finding one’s way through the labyrinth of
modern, differentiated and pluralized societies, but also implies understandings of a
certain moral order that cannot be reduced to its functionality in steering social
practices. Usually the implied reference of the pursuing of social practices to social
imaginaries and their normative taint goes without saying. Under conditions of societal
transformation, however, practices become transparent as to their moral references,
and thus questionable and criticisable on the grounds of their normative
embeddedness and their moral implications” (Langenohl/Westphal 2007: 9).</p>
      <p>With regard to normative socio-economic aspects underlying European policy
fields, the relevant philosophy of EU institutions towards that policy field has been
formed over a long period of time. It finds expression in the policy content as well
as in the promotion of certain procedures, by which the policy is carried through.
Nevertheless these underlying norms and rules are a dynamic explanans; they are
thus susceptible to processes of adaptations and changes over time.
Moreover, the relevant codes of communication and codes of bargaining,
applicable in the daily administrative and political work as well as in the internal
decision-making processes of EU institutions, have been internalized by the EU
personnel, the national delegations, the lobbyists and the MEPs, respectively7.
The enlargement of the European Union entails a kind of societal transformation
within EU institutions: While internal and external rules of the game become
transparent, this implicit knowledge has to be incorporated and habitualized by
members of the group of EU-8. While the foundation of this knowledge is a
dynamic one that allows for continuity as well as for changes, this special
transformation phase might entail a recomposition or a reconfiguration of
formalized knowledge and of principle frameworks8 to be applicable in the
enlarged EU of now 27 Member States. The circulation of ideas and values as well
as the application of new strategies and innovative approaches can be described
as cognitive Europeanization, in which personal and institutionalized aspects are
interwoven (Langenohl/Westphal 2007: 2). In general, concepts with reference to
“implicit knowledge”, social capital or “common sense” enable to put an academic
gloss on insights of social practice that seem obvious, and at other times yield
surprising results.
7 Implicit knowledge can be realized inter-subjectively by socialization. Thereby, knowledge either
retains its implicit form or it will be externalized, and thus transformed into explicit knowledge. This
happens through the process of articulation and codification.
8 While the knowledge is subject to different traditions, it is changeable and flexible through daily
action and experience. In the long run, also rules of institutions are considered as being permeable
and are thus considered to be possibly reconstructed.
The actual dilemmas and difficulties of the societies of new Member States in the
phase of consolidation are conceptually underpinned by political culture, cultural
legacies, traditions of election and euro-scepticism (Taggert/Szcerbiak 2004) as
well as by aspects of collective identity (Ademczyk/Gostmann 2007).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>Vectors of Influence</title>
      <p>The first factors influencing the degree of socialization and embeddedness in the
internal negotiation structures of relevant EU institution as well as the frames of
perception, are skills and training of actors of the EU-8: The highly skilled staff of
the Brussels scene might have benefited from traineeships or preparatory
administrative programmes such as Twinning9, the observer status in EU
institutions such as the Committee of Regions and the European Parliament. This
has enabled the participants of the Candidate States to already getting a feeling
for the setting and the internal (explicit and implicit) rules of each institution.
Moreover, in the field of training and education actors might have participated in
European-focused study programmes and language courses before the accession
in 2004. Through multi-lingual interdisciplinary education and training there is an
indirectly growing elite consensus over Europe: “One has to bear in mind that
throughout the region there is a relatively high degree of consensus among
(political) elites about the positive nature of European integration”
(Taggert/Szczerbiak 2004: 3). While the quality of human capital in the
Europeancentred administration is improving, a re-formation or a refining of knowledge
takes place: The capacity of this elite-circle enables for a differentiated
EUfocused thinking within line ministries and back-offices to support the Brussels
actors in a qualified way.</p>
      <p>From the perspective of new East and Central European Member States the year
of accession 2004 marked a rapid and dense flow of EU-focused expertise to the
Brussels arena. At the same time it is clear that a great number of EU
administrative staff is allotted from national line ministries for a period of three to
five years. Within the group of EU-8 the potential to nominate high-qualified EU
personnel from line ministries and from political parties for posts in the Brussels
scene varies. A characteristic of these newly formed networks is that they are
composed of relatively young, dynamic and flexible professionals. This means that
they are likely to regard the period of election, delegation or allotment in the
Brussels arena as a further step of underlying carrier opportunities in the national
context.</p>
      <p>With respect to Cohesion Policy the Polish side was able to send and to nominate
(much more intensively than e.g. the Hungarian side) experts in the field of
regionalisation and strong advocates of an integrated regional policy: They
possess technical and administrative expertise and they are personalities with a
European mission (personal expertise). Consequently, they were allotted high
ranking posts such as Commissioner for Regional Policy within the European
Commission or (Vice-)Chairmen of Committees in the European Parliament such

staff of old and new Member States which proofed valuable might be continued on a regular basis.

as the Committee for Regional Development. These persons have in common that
they have an international academic background in combination with formerly
high-ranking posts within the national administration and the political scene
respectively10. While they are using the Brussels experience to shape their
respective home career, they are supposed to have strong connections to the
national part of the Brussels scene.</p>
      <p>The second factor refers to the political background in East and Central European
Member States to allow for a relative independence and support which also
implies a close, trustworthy and open correspondence with national actors of the
Brussels scene. That means that there must be congruence between the content
of European-inspired thinking and the national elite’s positioning on the
transnational European integration process. Moreover, optimal chains of
communication to transfer the European-inspired knowledge adequately have to
be guaranteed.</p>
      <p>This European-inspired thinking affects questions of economic redistribution,
welfare and governmental regulation of the economy. These modes of distribution
are combined with several non-economic issues such as ecologist, gender and
lifestyle (Marks et al 2006: 157). In other words this implies norms and rules set by
EU institutions to handle e.g. EU Cohesion Policy and the European employment
policy, thus the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs, and cross-sections such as
the urban dimension, innovation policy, environmental protection, sustainable
growth and even enlargement and energy policy. These consolidated ideals of
Western civilization also affect procedural aspects such as participatory
decisionmaking. In this logic e.g. the European Parliament is the embodiment of issues
such as regionalization, culture, support of cultural and linguistic diversity as well
as social and territorial cohesion, which is now even codified in the Treaty of
Lisbon.</p>
      <p>Given the political and economic transnationalization, which European integration
implies, it has to be reflected that the state is still a central agent and a centre
stage for transnational processes as well as a vehicle for transnational
democratization (Langenohl/Westphal 2007: 8ff.). Moreover, it is important to
understand the domestic context of party competition in order to gain a full picture
of the context for national elite positions on European integration
(Taggert/Szczerbiak 2004: 17f.). In other words, parties can be considered as
gatekeepers for European interaction: European argumentation is closely related
to positions in their party systems (Taggert/Szczerbiak 2004: 2). Consequently,
actors of the Brussels scene are through direct or indirect party affinity embedded
in different frames of political thinking, which implies understandings of a certain
moral order and based on different regulatory ideas as to wealth distribution within
a given society (Langenohl/Westphal 2007: 8). Actors have thus to adequately
articulate political-societal projects to react to developments such as fragmenting,
10 Apart from Commissioner Mrs. Danuta Hübner, the MEPs Mr. Janowski (Civic Platform
Platforma Obywatelska (PO)) and Mr. Olbrycht (PO) and Mr. Sariusz-Wolski (PO) can be
mentioned. While from from 2004 onwards, e.g. the latter has been (Vice-) Chairman of the
Committee for External Affairs, he used to be Minister for European Affairs 1991-1996 and
20002001 and Counceller for the Prime Minister for questions relating to European Integration. In
addition, he was Vice-Director of the European-oriented University of Natolin, Poland.
disintegrative and exclusionary dynamics within societies. It is a discernible pattern
that it is easier for actors of oppositional parties to support pro-European views
and of having an increased interest to demonstrate leadership
(Taggert/Szczerbiak 2004). The capacity for strategic thinking and the
addresseeorientation among politicians and administrative staff of the Brussels scene also
depends on the frequency of governmental changes: Political changes might be
coupled with a shuffling of personnel and thematic reorientations as well as with
necessary changing loyalties11.</p>
      <p>As to the second factor it can be stated that Polish political activists for regional
policy of the Brussels scene are predominately pro-market libertarian oriented.
This means that their party affiliation allows them - as concerns EU issues - to
support so-called new politics dimensions such as environment and participatory
decision-making (Henderson 2001: 10 in Marks et al 2006: 168). While parties
aiming at a pro-market libertarian orientation were in opposition since the Polish
parliamentary elections of 2005 e.g. MEPs belonging to the PO were still in a
position to argue more quality than quantity-oriented, together with a view on
sidepolicy fields: Given that opposition party members were nationally not directly
responsible for the negotiation outcomes of the Councils of Ministers, they have
had the freedom to think in different categories and to carve out creative niches
while articulating political-societal projects. In this logic they could use the moral
embeddedness and integrational power of the relevant EU institution (and the
party family) for their transnational argumentation, while demonstrating an
openness for different regulatory ideas and an abandoning of nationally embedded
practices of norm- and rule-setting. This tendency is supported by the Polish
personnel of EU institutions such as the European Commission and the Council of
Ministers, which has been selected through big parties already in 2004.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>The negotiation potential of actors of the New Member States</title>
      <p>In the empirical part three examples are highlighted to illuminate the power of the
alleged peripheral group of EU-8. That means that the management of structural
mismatches might be beneficial for the so called outsiders. This inferior position
enables actors of this inner circle vis-à-vis their negotiation partners to
- be taken as an example because they have an openness for new thematic
fields (e.g. eco-tourism in the field of agriculture);
- introduce or suggest new and creative ways of thinking;
- have the “right” to act in a contra-factual way, which might at first sight
suggest a naïve way of behaving.</p>
      <p>Due to the similar authoritarian legacy, the commonly shared accession process,
thus the experience of “Europeanization from scratch” there is less diversity and
more bunching among the EU-8. Seen from the socio-economic angle, the group
of EU-8 formed net recipients with high expectations as to the volume and the
intensity of structural funds and CAP allowances. Within this new embeddedness,
some communities or clusters might again take the leadership: This might be true
for the Polish delegation due to the size of the delegation and the respective

administrative potential or for the Visegrád group as a special form of inner circle,
which goes back to geographic and historical-cultural proximity.</p>
      <p>Based on the advantage of a small number of interlocuters, already in 2004,
Working Groups among officials from the Permanent Representations of Member
States in Brussels were formed. To compensate for uncertainties regular, weekly
meetings and exchanges of additional information were organized on the basis of
the EU-8.</p>
      <p>To gain an insight into the potential of the EU-8, three examples are highlighted in
the following. These small case studies are based on increasingly popular themes.
New legal instrument: European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation (EGTC)
The main input for the introduction of this framework legal instrument and thus the
upgrade of the goal of territorial cohesion stems from the European Parliament in
close cooperation with the DG Regio of the European Commission. The underlying
assumption, which reflects the philosophy of the European Parliament, is to
incorporate the territorial dimension into Community policies, given the real impact
of sectoral policies – such as transport, environment, competition and research
policy – on the territory of the European Union. The initial draft, which included a
thematically broad arrangement and combined interregional, intraregional and
transnational dimensions was strongly supported by the Polish rapporteur,
nominated by the Committee on Regional Development in the EP, Mr Jan Olbrycht
(PO). The former president of Upper Silesia is a strong advocate for a far-reaching
regionalization. It is remarkable that - in the context of EU cohesion policy - he was
the only politician out of MEPs of the EU-8 to be nominated as rapporteur for a
draft regulation under the procedure of co-decision. Moreover, as a member of the
European People’s Party he has the standing and the openness to bargain with
other national delegations and to closely co-operate with other EU-institutions. In
this context, he could benefit from close and long-lasting personal contacts with
the Commissioner Mrs Danuta Hübner and with the Committee of the Regions
(CoR)12. Although the draft first met with resistance from various old Member
States based on a fear of loss of national sovereignty and of a too strong local or
regional level, finally the Council’s Common Position supported key elements of
the initial draft to manage cross-border projects more effectively. In addition, an
institutionalized integration of the CoR on the procedural side could be initiated for
the first time: This indirect instrumentalization of the CoR throws new lines into the
division of work of EU institutions and is an example of an – up to date – unusual
inter-institutional cooperation.</p>
      <p>It has to be admitted that the introduction of this legal instrument was possible also
due to its relatively cost-free stance. When it comes to the application, regionally
elected Polish MEPs such as Mr. Mieczyslaw Edmund Janowski (PO) were again
strong advocates for the introduction of diverse cross-border projects in the

Regional Operational Programmes of their constituencies. In addition, members of
the group of EU-8 might benefit from additional money from the title for External
Policy for the support of cross-border projects along EU’s external borders. This
means that although the Polish delegation was said to play the nationalistic card
(as to the Reform Treaty), the enthusiastic advocacy for the introduction of the
EGTC underlines a liberal stance.</p>
      <p>To sum up, the notion of territorial cohesion not only respects the principle of the
Lisbon Strategy by strengthening the cluster and network approach together with a
focus on the urban dimension, but it is now also fixed in the Lisbon Treaty.</p>

to policy framing the stress on the theme of housing underlines the importance of
the urban dimension and could be interpreted as a contribution to discussions of
the newly launched energy efficiency debate and the energy productivity
discussion. In addition, it implied aspects of social inclusion, thus another principle
underlying the European project.</p>
        <p>Based on the family of nation’s argument the introduction of this theme has been
promoted by representatives of former Visegrád countries13: Based on shared
problems with the conversion of unused industrial buildings, beneficiaries should
be exclusively new Member States. The final introduction of this policy strand in
the General Provision of EU cohesion policy in mid-2006 was remarkable, since
the financing of housing aspects happens for the first time ever. In general, it
follows the actual European-wide tendency that the urban dimension is
strengthened by a separate Communication of the European Commission in
autumn of 2006. In addition, energy efficiency aspects have become increasingly
important during the last years, reflected in the agenda of the Summit of G-8. In
sum, the group of EU-8 has proved to be forerunners and has carved out a
creative niche.</p>

        <title>New modes of governance: the politics of new financial instruments</title>
        <p>The third example reflects the introduction of new financial instruments and the
application of new procedures. The underlying assumption is that a set of new
instruments is used as a vehicle to support the goals of the updated Lisbon
Strategy of 2005: The main aim is to ensure an integrated approach to the
enhancement of competitiveness and growth in Europe which includes active
labour market instruments such as training and retraining, but also focus the urban
dimension, innovation policy, energy policy as well as rural development.
In the negotiation phase actors of the group of EU-8 showed an affinity for the
introduction and the application of new financial instruments such as Jaspers,
Jeremie and Jessica. As to e.g. Jeremie the application of Public Private
Partnership under the financially most attractive goal convergence is to improve

the business environment and to promote employment growth among small and
medium-sized enterprises (SME). Priority projects might focus the creation of the
knowledge-based (innovative) economy, the improvement of access to capital of
the SME sector and the development of industrial and logistics parks.
In practice, the stress on this dimension was beneficial for the five
socioeconomically poorest regions in Poland. At the end of the financial negotiations in
mid-2006, additional money is granted to five vojevodships with the obligation to
stress and to support the innovation capacity. At the same time, the notion of
public private partnership refers to a process-orientation with the involvement and
commitments of local partners. These arrangements include alliances of
knowledge between universities and enterprises and thus narrow nationally
embedded practices of norms and rule-setting.</p>
        <p>In the context of lobbying for a regionally based innovation-orientation the strong
input from the Polish MEP Mr Mieczyslaw Edmund Janowski14 (PO) should be
mentioned. He is the author of an Initiative Report on „the contribution of the future
regional policy to the innovative capacity of the EU”, adopted in the spring of 2007.
During the redaction of the report he has closely cooperated with a Dutch MEP of
the same political fraction, sharing the affinity of the principle of “open innovation”.
Moreover, Mr Janowski is a regionally based advocate for the necessary
information campaign as to the broad application of instruments such as Jeremie
and Jaspers. In consequence, Poland was among the first to open a liaison office
in Warsaw in 2007 for Jaspers: While showing a great amount of goodwill, the
Polish authorities’ part of the Brussels scene are regarded as forerunners.
Moreover, based on the Twinning experience, regular networking conferences
focusing the innovation capacity are organized with Dutch partners. While
bilaterally exchanging experience, promoting increased cooperation and improving
the coordination between relevant actors at all levels, the potential for best
practice under the Open Method of Coordination is used.</p>
        <p>These newly launched instruments can be financially more or less ignored.
Nevertheless, they are quality-oriented and they might thus entail long-lasting,
wide-spread effects on the procedural side. It can be stated that the Polish MEPs
were able to benefit from the vectors of opportunity based on the internal
philosophy of the European Parliament. Moreover, possessing of the necessary
political background, they were able to fulfil their role as transmitter of the
European-inspired approach as to the innovation and cross-border orientation into
the national and regional socio-economic contexts.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>The aim of this paper was to nuance the understanding of bargaining from the
perspective of newcomers. This paper has provided a preliminary mapping of
negotiation tactics and strategies of actors of the EU-8. In presenting three case
studies it has become clear that there exists a potential for successful
negotiations, which yielded surprising results on the policy, politics and even polity

beginning of the 1990s he is interested in the regionalization of Poland and he is a founding

level. Actors of the group of EU-8 could successfully use their outsider status and
the semi-optimal integration as an instrument to reinforce their negotiation
possibilities. The newcomers were thus able to positively “play the card of
underdogs”.</p>
      <p>It remains an open question whether participants now better know how to cope
with the knowledge of increased - by definition multilateral - possibilities of
negotiations in the concert of now 27 Member States, while being alert to the
Reform Treaty as a future basis of conduct. Are actors of the EU-8 now fully
incorporated into the internal structures of supranational institutions of the EU? In
addition, it remains to be seen, whether regional formations or clusterings such as
the Visegrád Group will pertain as new inner circles, based on smooth cooperation
during the last years.</p>
      <p>In a medium term perspective actors of the EU-8, which are socialized and
embedded in the internal structures, might increasingly be able to argue out of the
corpus of the respective EU institution. This dynamic and somewhat transformed
knowledge might be incorporated in the working agenda or the philosophy of a
department of the European Institution or in the work of the national context of the
Brussels scene.
