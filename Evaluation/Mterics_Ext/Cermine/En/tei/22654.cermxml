Introduction
This special issue examines a number of key issues in cultural theory
through the development of, and reaction to, a popular television
character, the vampire Spike from the cult television success Buffy the Vampire
Slayer. As the latest in a long line of sympathetic vampires, Spike’s textual
construction rearticulates the dualities which fictional vampires have long
embodied: the simultaneous expression of erotic repulsion and attraction;
a fear of and desire for the ‘Other’; the ambivalences of a troubling
ontology figured through a creature that is neither dead nor alive. As Nina
Auerbach has stated: ‘Vampires are neither inhuman nor nonhuman nor
all-too-human; they are simply more alive than they should be’ (1995: 6).
Like his fictional ancestors, Spike blurs boundaries and raises ambiguities,
but he does so in a manner firmly located in today’s cultural landscape.
Spike joins Buffy the Vampire Slayer in Season 2 with a swagger and a
vulnerability which alludes to the many oppositions that he will come to
unsettle. Spike is polymorphous: he is both man and monster, both
masculine and feminine; and his increasingly fractured self undermines
the Manichaean struggle which is central to so much of today’s popular
culture.</p>
      <p>Spike’s character also raised important questions about the boundaries
of the text. Our understanding of Spike depends upon a number of
extratextual factors: intertextual pop culture references; allusions to musical
subcultures; and knowledge of the actor James Marsters, who plays him.
Spike has spawned a huge fan culture and his audience appeal suggests
that he articulates a number of cultural issues, of which this special issue
examines several in depth. However, in this introduction we would like to
provide some contextual background to the television show in which Spike
comes to such prominence, and offer a way into the text for those
unfamiliar with it.</p>
      <p>Buffy the Vampire Slayer (aka Buffy or BtVS) first appeared in 1992 as
a film. It was written by Joss Whedon, directed by Fran Rubel Kuzui and
started Kristy Swanson as the eponymous heroine – high-school student
by day, but vampire slayer by night. The film was not a huge success, but
in 1997 the character of Buffy returned to TV (played by Sarah Michelle
Gellar) and became a huge hit. This time Joss Whedon was more firmly
in control as creator, executive producer and (on occasion) writer and
director. In the words of Jane Espenson, one of the show’s writers, ‘it is so
Joss’s show’ (2004: 101), and it is his creative vision that has to be held to
account for the success of the TV show when the film had made such little
impact.</p>
      <p>Whedon has argued that it was always his intention that Buffy should
become an iconic show. In an oft-quoted interview he said:</p>
      <p>
        I designed the show to create that strong reaction. I designed Buffy to be an
icon, to be an emotional experience, to be loved in a way that other shows can’t
be loved. Because it’s about adolescence, which is the most important thing
people go through in their development, becoming an adult. And it
mythologizes it in such a way, such a romantic way – it basically says, ‘Everybody who
made it through adolescence is a hero.’ And I think that’s very personal, that
people get something from that that’s very real.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(quoted in Lavery, 2004: 4)</xref>
        Within the world of cult TV Whedon has become regarded as genius/
auteur
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref24">(Lavery, 2002)</xref>
        helming not only Buffy (1997–2003), but its spin-off
series Angel (1999–2004) and the ill-fated Firefly (2002). All three series
have received critical acclaim and have become the subject of fan devotion.
At the beginning of 2005, the website Buffysearch.com listed a total of
3973 sites dedicated to Buffy and Angel, including 1094 general BtVS sites,
627 sites featuring fan fiction from the two series and 612 sites focusing on
the cast. Of these, 68 focus on Spike and/or James Marsters, with only
Buffy and/or Sarah Michelle Gellar herself having more fan sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, Whedon’s work has attracted considerable academic
attention. Speaking at the 2004 Slayage Conference on Buffy the Vampire
Slayer, David Lavery (co-editor of the first academic book on Buffy –
Fighting the Forces: What’s at Stake in Buffy the Vampire Slayer) claimed
that ‘Buffy studies’ ‘comprised at least fifty disciplines, methods, and/or
approaches’ and Sue
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">Turnbull (2004)</xref>
        has noted that there are at least 12
serious academic books on Buffy and an (online) international journal.
There have already been three international conferences on the show, in
the UK, Australia and the US. This year will see a further conference held
at the Centre for Constructions and Identities at the University of
276 Huddersfield on ‘Social Life, Human Experience and the Works of Joss
Whedon’ and a 2006 conference, again focusing on the oeuvre of Whedon,
is to be held in Nashville, TN.
      </p>
      <p>Despite the demise of Buffy in 2003 (after seven seasons and a total of
144 episodes) and Angel in 2004 (after five seasons and 110 episodes),
interest in both shows and their characters remains unabated and the
show is an ongoing, international phenomenon. In fact, in the US, revenue
creation and audience interest in TV shows only begins with the network
run, which is followed by syndication and then sales of DVDs, videos and
related merchandise. Today in the US Buffy the Vampire Slayer reruns are
shown twice a week in syndication on the cable channel FX and numerous
local affiliates. Indeed, according to Nielsen ratings, the weekend debut of
Buffy the Vampire Slayer in broadcast syndication in October 2001 was
the highest rating premiere of an off-network weekly rerun since ER in
1998.1</p>
      <p>Furthermore, reruns currently air on terrestrial, cable and satellite
channels in over a dozen European countries, a number of Latin American
and South American countries, and at least one Arab TV channel. The
show continues to be a thriving source of licensing and merchandising
revenue, with large numbers of websites selling everything from DVDs,
video games, posters, photos, stickers, patches and jewellery, to life-size
cardboard stand-up figures of the show’s stars, mobile phone ringtones,
stationery sets, spin-off novels, guidebooks and fridge magnets. Both Buffy
the Vampire Slayer and Angel continue to be important players in the
media world and audience interest in both shows and their characters
remains high.</p>
      <p>Buffy (and Spike) for beginners
But what exactly is Buffy the Vampire Slayer? Apart from the reasons given
by Joss Whedon that we have quoted, why did the show become such a
phenomenal success? As stated in the show’s title, Buffy herself is the
‘vampire slayer’. In the mythology of the series, this means that she is the
one girl who has been chosen to defend the world: as the opening voiceover
to many of the early episodes states, ‘She alone will stand against the
vampires, the demons and the forces of darkness’. Yet the voiceover is
misleading – for Buffy is not alone. Unlike earlier Slayers, Buffy breaks
the mould by having a range of friends and allies who help her in her
fight. From the outset she has loyal friends – Willow and Xander. These
two form the core of the group known in the ‘Buffyverse’ (the colloquial
term used to describe the diegetic world of Buffy) as the Scooby Gang, or
‘Scoobies’, in homage to the TV show Scooby Doo (premiered 1969). Over
the course of the seven seasons of the show additional characters come and
go, including Cordelia, Oz, Riley, Anya and Tara. In Season 5 Buffy also
acquires a sister, Dawn. In addition to these characters, Buffy is able to call
on the services of a mentor, Rupert Giles (generally known as Giles) sent 277
by the Council of Watchers (a mysterious organization that oversees the
world of the vampire slayer).</p>
      <p>There is also Angel, a vampire since the mid-1700s who, at the end of
the 19th century, is cursed by gypsies with a soul that leads him to repent
of his evil-doing and to side with Buffy. Of course in the ‘Buffyverse’ (as
in all serial TV, which relies on long drawn-out story arcs) things are never
this simple. Each season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer generally revolves
around a drawn-out battle between Buffy and the Scoobies and one major
enemy (known in ‘Buffyspeak’ as the ‘Big Bad’).2 In Season 2 (1997–8) the
Big Bad turns out to be Angel who, having experienced a ‘moment of true
happiness’ through sex with Buffy, loses his soul and turns on Buffy and
her friends.3 However, Angel does not turn into Buffy’s nemesis until part
way through the season (episode 14).4 For the first part of the season
viewers are misled into thinking that Buffy’s key enemy this year is to be
another vampire – Spike. Spike’s evolving role in this season marks his
move from one of the show’s expendable adversaries to one of its central
and most enduring characters (see Hills and Williams, in this issue, for
more on Spike’s transition from guest appearance to regular cast member).</p>
      <p>Spike’s first appearance is in the episode ‘School Hard’ (2:3). He is
shown arriving in Sunnydale with his long-time girlfriend (and
fellowvampire) Drusilla. According to the narrative, Drusilla is weak, having
been set upon by a mob in Prague, and Spike has brought her to Sunnydale
(which in the mythology of the show has been built over the Hellmouth,
the site of convergence for a range of evil and mystical forces) in order to
restore her to health. From the very beginning we are told that there is a
connection between the two vampires Angel and Spike, with Spike
describing Angel as his sire, ‘You were my sire, man! You were my . . .
Yoda’5 (see below for the way that the series rewrites their history). As
Spike was intended only as a temporary villain he is inactive for much of
the latter part of Season 2, coming to prominence only in the final two
episodes when he helps Buffy to defeat the now-evil Angel (who, when he
reverts to his original vampire ego, takes the name of Angelus). Spike
appears in only one episode of Season 3, but returns as a key character
from Season 4 onwards when he becomes the main vampire character
(Angel having departed for his own show). And when Buffy finally
finishes its seven-year run in 2003, Spike migrates to the spin-off show
Angel for its final year.</p>
      <p>Spike’s story arc in Buffy is compelling, and as the show progresses we
find out more about his history (shown to the audience through the use of
flashback). William, Spike’s human incarnation, was born into a
middleclass Victorian household. As we find out from the episodes ‘Fool for Love’
(5:7) and ‘Lies My Parents Told Me’ (7:17) he was shy and retiring, fond
(perhaps overly fond) of his mother, and given to writing ‘bloody awful’
poetry – much of it dedicated to his unrequited love for Cecily. One
278 evening in 1880, after being rejected by Cecily, who has told him that she
can never love him because he is her social inferior, he ventures into the
street where he is lured into an alley by the vampire Drusilla. In this
flashback it is Drusilla who (in a revision of the storyline from Season 2)
sires him. Free of his mortal incarnation, William reinvents himself as
‘Spike’, adopting a working-class persona and becoming a fearsome killer.
Over the course of more than 100 years he makes himself the scourge of
Europe, and manages to kill two of Buffy’s Slayer predecessors – one in
1900 during the Boxer Rebellion in China and another in New York in
1977.</p>
      <p>However, Spike’s murderous persona begins to alter slowly in relation
to Buffy, initially in Season 2 when, for personal reasons, he helps her
defeat the evil Angelus. His permanent return to the show in Season 4 sees
Spike rendered harmless to humans when a covert group of government
operatives (the ‘Initiative’) implant a ‘chip’ in his brain which prevents
Spike from harming humans. He finds, however, that the chip does not
prevent him harming other demons and vampires so, as an outlet for his
violence, he finds himself an unlikely ally to Buffy and the Scoobies. By
Season 5 he has fallen in love with Buffy although, not surprisingly, his
affection is not returned (in an echo of his relationship with Cecily, Buffy
tells Spike he is beneath her). By the end of Season 5 he is willing to give
his life to save Buffy and her sister Dawn, but it is Buffy who makes this
sacrifice and dies.</p>
      <p>
        Resurrected in Season 6 (brought back from the dead by a spell from
Willow, who has become a powerful Wicca) Buffy finds herself
increasingly isolated from her friends and turns to Spike for comfort, embarking
on a passionate but soulless relationship. When she finally renounces this
relationship Spike endeavours to re-ignite it, but ends up attempting to
rape her. This act provokes a crisis of conscience that results in Spike
departing for Africa where, after a series of trials, he is able to win back his
soul (see Abbott, in this issue, for more on the ambiguity surrounding this
development). Season 7 sees the newly-ensouled Spike return to
Sunnydale and attempt to rebuild his relationship with the Slayer, once
again fighting at her side as she faces the greatest challenge of her life – a
battle against the ‘First Evil’. The season ends with Spike sacrificing his
life to save the world. If this echoes Buffy’s sacrifice at the end of Season 5
then his return on the spin-off show Angel echoes her resurrection (see
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23 ref24">Wilcox (2002)</xref>
        for a more detailed analysis of parallels between Spike and
Buffy). In the early episodes of Angel Season 5, Spike is quite literally a
ghost of his former self. But recorporealized he joins Angel’s side in, once
again, fighting evil (albeit reluctantly). The final episode of the final
series of Angel (‘Not Fade Away’, A5:22) sees Spike in an alley alongside
Angel facing seemingly insuperable odds. The show ends as the battle is
about to commence – Spike’s ultimate fate remains unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spike’s character progression (or ‘arc’ as Whedon and his scriptwriters
prefer) throughout Buffy the Vampire Slayer comes to represent the show’s 279
key themes of angst and outsiderdom perhaps more fully than that of any
other character. All of the central characters in Buffy the Vampire Slayer
are, as Roz
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">Kaveney (2004</xref>
        : 7) puts it, ‘refugees from hierarchy of one sort
or another’. Buffy’s best friend Willow is a high-school geek turned
Wiccan, who has a lesbian relationship with Tara, herself an exile from an
oppressive patriarchal family. The other prominent (and permanent)
character in the Scooby Gang, Xander, is depicted as a ‘loser’ both in terms
of his high-school experience and his masculine identity. He eventually
finds love with a fallen vengeance demon, Anya, only to abandon her at
the altar. Even Buffy herself, locked into a role as the Slayer which is
beyond her control, is depicted as an outcast. Buffy the Vampire Slayer is
concerned centrally with the issue of outsiderdom, both in terms of its
character portrayal and in individual episodes (‘Out of Sight, Out of Mind
[a.k.a. Invisible Girl]’, 1:11; ‘Earshot’, 3:18). However, it is Spike who
expresses this marginality most completely, as even members of the
Scooby Gang generally want nothing to do with him. He is, in effect, the
outcast’s outcast.
      </p>
      <p>Not only does Spike express the marginality associated with the
fictional vampire more generally (neither dead nor alive, a figure on the
edges of humanity), he is an outcast in a fictional world that otherwise
embraces marginal social identities, and in a show that speaks to and from
the experience of outsiderdom. Shunned even by the Scoobies –
themselves social outcasts – Spike suffers an extreme form of outsiderdom and
marginality. This may partly explain the tremendous interest in this
figure and the enormous fandom which surrounds him, for Spike’s
character fully articulates that which makes Buffy the Vampire Slayer such
a cult success – the experience of the outcast and the pain of liminality, of
not belonging. Williamson (in this issue) will explore this aspect of the
show’s, and in particular Spike’s, appeal in more depth.</p>
      <p>
        Buffy – unsettling the codes of representation
Buffy the Vampire Slayer may have started out as teen TV dealing with the
trials of adolescence, but – as the number of books and articles that the
show has generated testifies – quickly transcended this generic label to
develop a cult following among audiences of all ages. Perhaps the key
reason for this is that while, at its literal level, it functions as a
coming-ofage story about a girl with superpowers, at the metaphorical level it deals
with many of the fundamental themes of existence that haunt the
postmodern condition
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15 ref21 ref23 ref24">(see, for example, South, 2003; Wilcox and Lavery,
2002; and the numerous contributions to the online journal Slayage;
http://www.slayage.tv)</xref>
        . Jean-Francois
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">Lyotard (1984</xref>
        : xxiv) has summed
up the postmodern condition as ‘incredulity toward metanarrative’, and
certainly metanarratives of good and evil, the human and the monstrous,
280 the clear distinction between right and wrong, all are disrupted
systematically in a show that is formally structured around ‘good’ versus
‘evil’. Each of the Scoobies in some way blurs these distinctions (for
example, Willow’s witchcraft spins out of control and becomes an
addiction; Buffy kills Ted, who she suspects is a monster but who might be
human), but it is Spike who disrupts them most fully. Spike’s ambiguity
and his movement between the poles of good and evil, human and
monstrous, upset the dichotomies on which modern Manichaean thinking
rests.
      </p>
      <p>Spike’s character also unsettles the metanarratives regarding the
wholeness of the ‘self ’. Spike’s character poses interesting questions about
the ‘self ’ in our time in ways which resonate with the experience of
marginality, but which also raise questions about the fractured self. Just as
Spike expresses the outcast more fully than any other character in the
show’s ensemble, so too does he embody most fully the predicaments of a
fractured subjectivity: the idea that we have not one, but multiple
identities, which contend for dominance and that our subjectivities are
neither fixed nor stable over the course of our lives. The way in which this
applies to Spike is made clear in many of the articles in this issue, but
receives perhaps its fullest expression in Abbott’s detailed study of his
character in Season 7.</p>
      <p>Even more challengingly, Spike’s character explores the ambiguity of
gender and the pleasures of the queer self, and most fully blurs the
persistent binary narrative governing representations of gender and
sexuality. Both Buffy and Angel are populated with figures who seek to
question traditional modes of classification, who undergo unexpected
transformations and who embody the polymorphous perverse (as taken
from Freud, but with an attempt to strip the notion of any pathological
connotations). Indeed, the key to the appeal of the ‘Buffyverse’ is the way
in which it invites the notion that binary ways of thinking are redundant.
The possibilities offered by challenging binary constructions of gender are
articulated most completely through the body of Spike. Indeed, it seems as
though Spike’s character performs that which other characters in the
series (and other sympathetic vampires in history) only promise. Where
other character pairings in Buffy the Vampire Slayer only promise the
pleasures of homosexual and/or queer desire that are never realised,
Spike acts out erotic desire in a manner that undermines heterosexual/
homosexual and masculine/feminine binaries. As this issue will
demonstrate, Spike thereby exemplifies Braidotti’s ‘nomadic subject’, ‘a myth,
that is to say a political fiction, that allows [me] to move across established
categories and levels of experience: blurring boundaries without burning
bridges’ (1994: 4).</p>
      <p>
        In the sense that Spike acts out erotic desire, he has a great deal in
common with the 19th-century lesbian vampire (despite his male
identity). Nina
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">Auerbach (1995)</xref>
        suggests that unlike her male
counterparts, the lesbian vampire Carmilla
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">(Le Fanu, 1991[1872])</xref>
        performs the 281
promises of the sympathetic vampire, ‘she arouses, she pervades, she offers
a sharing of the self. This female vampire is licensed to realize the erotic,
interpenetrative friendship male vampires aroused and denied’ (1995: 39).
While the erotic relationship between the vampire Angel and Buffy
results in the reanimation of Angel’s bad self, Angelus, which amounts to
a refusal of interpenetrative intimacy and a reassertion of gender
boundaries, Buffy’s pairing with Spike is far more fluid and complex. Like the
lesbian vampire of more than a century earlier, Spike is capable of an
intimacy and a sharing of the self that other males in the series (even other
sympathetic vampires) cannot accomplish. Thus Spike absolutely blurs
the line between male and female desire, and between homosexual and
heterosexual desire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spike, intertextuality and kinship
As befits its status as a canonical popular text of postmodernity, Buffy quite
deliberately courts an intertextuality that addresses the knowing
fanreader. Seeking to supersede the vampire chronicles of Anne Rice as the
defining vampire text of the late 20th century, Buffy’s vampires mock the
portrayal offered by Rice. But at the same time the show acknowledges her
influence – for by making Angel Spike’s ‘sire’ it knowingly reproduces the
relationship between Lestat and Louis. At this point Spike is cast in the
role of Louis, but as befits the complexity of the ‘Buffyverse’ this
identification is rapidly called into question. As Williamson argues in the first
article in this issue, Spike may be the more junior of the two vampires, but
at the point in time at which we encounter these two it is he, not Angel,
who takes the role of the modernized, sceptical vampire who does not
abide by the traditionally sanctioned vampire law embodied by Lestat
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(see
Gelder, 1994)</xref>
        . This is summed up in Spike’s penultimate line in ‘School
Hard’ – ‘From now on, we’re gonna have a little less ritual and a little
more fun around here’. Much later in the show’s history (in a flashback in
‘Lies My Parents Told Me’) there is a further nod to Spike-as-Lestat when
we find that, on becoming a vampire, one of Spike’s first acts is to ‘sire’ his
mother.6 As befits the non-normative kinship of vampire families, the son
gives the gift of unlife to the woman who gave him life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet the show subsequently denies the erotic reading of the Angel/Spike
relationship implied by the initial Lestat/Louis intertextual reference.
Siring has always been a metaphor for sexual intercourse, as Rice’s
description of Louis’ siring at the hands of Lestat makes clear. Gelder
comments that Lestat ‘takes’ Louis like a lover in a ‘drawn-out ecstatic
moment which has them mingling their fluids together’
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Gelder, 1994:
112)</xref>
        . It is perhaps for this reason that, when we get to see Spike’s siring in
flashback in the Season 5 episode ‘Fool for Love’, the show rewrites its own
history to make Drusilla Spike’s progenitor (although, as so often, this
282 show has it both ways with a scene shortly afterwards showing Angel(us)
straddling Spike and holding a stake to his chest in a classic gesture of
phallic mastery). Moreover, the homoerotic reading of the relationship
between Angel and Spike resurfaces with a vengeance in the volume of fan
writing that surrounds the show and provides a parallel to the canonical
text.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Fool for Love’ is a notable episode in that it makes explicit the queer
nature of the vampire family within the ‘Buffyverse’. Of course, queer
vampire families are nothing new. Gelder explores the nature of the
family ties between Lestat, Louis and Claudia (and beyond to the original
vampire ‘parents’ Enkil and Akasha) in Rice’s Vampire Chronicles
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Gelder,
1994)</xref>
        and questions of family feature in the cult vampire films of the
1980s such as Near Dark (Kathryn Bigelow, 1987) and The Lost Boys (Joel
Schumacher, 1987). However, the family dynamics in the ‘Buffyverse’
take questions of kinship to a new level in the very complex relationship
between Angel, Spike and Drusilla and a fourth vampire, Darla (the
woman who sires Angelus in the 18th century). But the real point about
kinship in the ‘Buffyverse’ is that queer kinship extends beyond vampire
families and into the world of the human characters. Judith Butler has
argued that:
      </p>
      <p>If we understand kinship as a set of practices that institutes relationships of
various kinds which negotiate the reproduction of life and the demands of
death, then kinship practices will be those that emerge to address fundamental
forms of human dependency, which may include birth, child-rearing, relations
of emotional dependency and support, generational ties, illness, dying, and
death (to name a few). (Butler, 2004: 102–3)</p>
      <p>
        If we accept Butler’s definition of kinship practices then one of the most
meaningful aspects of Whedon’s work (and this applies to Buffy, Angel
and Firefly) is the opportunity that it offers to explore the complexities of
affiliation which govern non-normative communities of support – thus
further complicating the dynamics of gender and sexuality underpinning
the show(s). This definition of kinship also chimes within fandom, as fans
often understand their practices to be part of forming alternative
communities

      <p>About this special issue
Williamson opens this special issue by exploring what Spike has in
common with a much longer tradition of sympathetic vampires and,
drawing on empirical research, she examines the appeal of this figure to
fans of the vampire. Offering an historical overview of the evolution of the
sympathetic vampire, she explores how this figure entered the 20th
century as one of empathy whose ‘Otherness’ does not provoke fear, but 283
rather is often that which we recognize in ourselves. Williamson suggests
that Spike is both constructed and read through these historical and
intertextual modes, but that he updates the appeal of Otherness in significant
ways. For example, unlike previous incarnations of the vampire, the cult
TV text from which Spike emerges deliberately encourages audiences to
acknowledge and play with its many intertextual references to previous
vampires; it encourages a fannish immersion in the text by constructing
the text as subtext, with deliberate textual winks and nods, and extended
plotlines which dwell on their own convoluted construction. The
intertextual and sub-textual nature of the show is revealed most through
Spike’s construction and is clearly identifiable in the relationship between
Spike and Buffy, which draws on the ‘subtextual’ conventions of the ‘slash
fiction’ written by fans. In this sense the text offers the polymorphous
sexuality (through Spike) that is usually the realm of erotic fan fiction.</p>
      <p>In the second piece in this volume, Amy-Chinn argues that this
polymorphous sexuality is one of the many ways in which Spike transgresses
boundaries. She contends that Spike does not simply subvert gender norms
or sexual norms, but that Spike is ‘queer’. Amy-Chinn deconstructs the
artificial boundary between gender and sexuality through which
transgression has previously been theorized in order to demonstrate that
Spike’s ‘queerness’ operates through his erotic mobility. Spike’s sexuality
and gender are simultaneously intertwined and fluid – he performs
excessive masculinity and active femininity. Yet while his biological
maleness is never in doubt, what it signifies is endlessly shifting.
AmyChinn examines not only the ways in which Spike switches between male
and female, but also his ability to accommodate ‘vanilla’ sex and erotic
variation.</p>
      <p>For example, Spike’s relationship with Buffy is often based on Spike
taking the traditional ‘woman’s part’ (a desire for intimacy) and Buffy
taking the ‘man’s part’ (sex followed by flight) and it is one based on
polymorphous sexual desire on both their parts. Spike refuses to define
their encounters as abject or degrading, despite the fact that he is rejected
and abused by Buffy. But, Amy-Chinn argues, it is the power imbalance in
their relationship (with Buffy firmly in the driving seat), rather than their
unconventional and socially unacceptable sex life, that makes their
relationship a failure. She also insists that the show has an ambivalent
attitude to the ‘queerness’ it depicts by locating it in Spike, who for most
of the seven seasons is a figure of revulsion. However, Amy-Chinn suggests
that for all of its hesitations, the depiction of Spike is one that contributes
to the breakdown of gender oppositions, and to the visibility of
unconventional erotic practices, thus unsettling the prevailing heteronormative
matrix and contributing to the ‘thinkability’ of traditionally taboo
practices.</p>
      <p>In the third article, Abbott elaborates upon the way in which Spike
284 updates the conventions associated with the reluctant vampire by focusing
on the depiction of moral ambiguity. Abbott argues that, while previous
vampires walk a fine line between good and evil, Spike inhabits a far more
fractured self that overreaches this binary opposition. Through an analysis
of the narrative structure and mise-en-scène of the final series of Buffy the
Vampire Slayer, Abbott demonstrates that Spike undergoes the most
dramatic character development of any of the characters in the show, and
that this is effected through the presentation of multiple Spikes, a self that
is looking for unity, but that has been exponentially fragmented. Noting
Spike’s move from being ‘bad’, to being ‘chipped’ (an implant which
prevents him from harming humans), to being ‘mad’, to being ensouled,
Abbott examines in detail the manner in which Spike’s multiplicity is
overtly addressed within the narrative and dialogue of the show. She
relates this to the deconstruction of Spike’s leather-clad bad-boy biker
image in Season 7, each of Spike’s multiple selves being depicted through
a different visual look. Abbott examines how these multiple selves operate
to push the narrative forward in the final season, arguing that it is only
Spike’s recognition and acceptance of his own fractured nature which
enables him to acquire the strength he needs to sacrifice himself in the
season finale. Only this way can Spike contribute to the show’s ultimate
lesson, which abjures the privileging of uniqueness (of himself or even the
Slayer) in favour of celebrating the power of collective action.</p>
      <p>Hills and Williams’ piece shifts the discussion from one which
concentrates on the textual construction of, and the fannish engagements
with, the character Spike, to one which examines the relationship
between the character and the meanings attached to him by the actor who
plays him, James Marsters. Hills and Williams argue that Marsters’
impact on our understanding of his character is ‘situated’. By this they
mean that Marsters does have agency in terms of interpreting Spike (both
on-screen and off), but that this is tempered by his role in the hierarchy of
production (wracked as it is with internal struggles) in which he does not
have an entirely ‘free hand’ in the performance of his star persona. Hills
and Williams consider Marsters to be a ‘subcultural celebrity’, by which
they mean a celebrity specific to the audience and fandom surrounding
Buffy the Vampire Slayer, rather than by general star recognition. There is
an overlapping between Marsters and Spike in a number of secondary
texts that circulate around the show, which Hills and Williams consider
not only to merge actor and character, but which also make Marsters
appear ‘fan-like’; they suggest that this disrupts the distance between ‘fan’
and ‘celebrity’. Key to this intervention is Marsters’ self-styled
accessibility to his fans. His positive encounters with fans having been
perfected, he manages to perform simultaneously the role of accessible
nice guy and enigmatic persona. In addition, rather than seeing celebrity
as only a product of institutional forces, Hills and Williams suggest that
Marsters’ celebrity indicates a need to examine more closely the way in
which actors participate in industry forms of promotion.</p>
      <p>This special issue then moves on to a shorter piece by Sue Turnbull
which develops Hills and Williams’ contribution by offering a personal
meditation on the way in which Marsters performs Spike, and the effect
that this has on the author. Turnbull explores the way in which
performance can become part of our own lived experience – inspiring and
transforming the viewer – and suggesting that watching television can
indeed have an impact on the way in which we experience the world.</p>
      <p>
        This special issue closes with a commentary by Vivien Burr on the 2004
Slayage Conference on Buffy the Vampire Slayer held in Nashville in May
2004, and combines ethnographic analysis with reflection on the
fan–scholar divide that has been the subject of much academic attention
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref12 ref13 ref20 ref6 ref8">(for example, Burt, 1998; Doty, 2000; Frith, 1990; Hills, 2002; Jenkins,
1992; Michael, 2000)</xref>
        . In his own reflections on the conference, one of the
organizers, David
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">Lavery (2004)</xref>
        , talks about almost 400 Buffy scholar-fans
and fan-scholars ‘having the time of their lives talking about, dissecting,
and singing about a show they love beyond the possibility to describe’.
Lavery is responding to criticism by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">Levine and Schneider (2003)</xref>
        in
‘Feeling for Buffy: The Girl Next Door’ that Buffy scholars are so in love
with the show that their scholarship is often unreflective, narrow and
mistaken.
      </p>
      <p>Yet Burr calls into questions Lavery’s emotive response to Levine and
Schnieder’s criticism noting that she, and several other conference
attendees who responded to her enquiries, felt stirrings of unease when it was
mentioned that thought had been given to inviting a member of Buffy’s
cast to the conference. Moreover, she notes that sessions did, on occasion,
veer away from academic analysis into heated discussion on topics that did
not seem to fit into a scholarly environment. She notes, in particular that
emotions ran high on the subject of Spike – and that any scholar
presenting a paper that sought to criticize the character was met with
considerable hostility. This, of course, is to show precisely that lack of
critical distance for which Levine and Schneider so roundly condemn
Buffy studies.</p>
      <p>Burr does not attempt to address the reasons why Spike is such a site of
contention among fan-scholars and scholar-fans and we were intrigued,
although not surprised, that this was the case. Rather, it confirmed to us
that there was indeed something about Spike that resonated with fans and
scholars of the show in a way not found in the other supporting characters,
and that this warranted an in-depth analysis.</p>
      <p>
        As far as we are aware, despite the huge volume of Buffy and Angel
scholarship available in print and on the internet, this is the first time a
single, supporting character of the shows has been the focus of an
academic endeavour. We hope that the articles in this issue convince the
reader that Spike is worth both the accolade and the effort.

2. Buffy the Vampire Slayer has become renowned among both fans and
scholars for its creative use of language and the creation of ‘Buffyspeak’. A
Buffy lexicon has been published by Oxford University Press
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(Adams,

the Vampire Slayer’ (forthcoming).

4. Throughout this special issue, episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer will be
referenced by title with the season and episode given in brackets
afterwards. Episodes of the spin-off show Angel will follow the same format
but will be prefixed with an A. Episodes are referenced in each article, but
only the first time that they are cited.
5. ‘Siring’ is the ‘Buffyverse’ term for the process by which a human becomes
a vampire and involves, in keeping with vampire mythology, the exchange
of blood between two parties.
6. In the DVD commentary to this episode the writers (David Fury and Drew
Goddard) reveal that they gave Spike’s mother the name ‘Anne’. They say
they chose this as it is Buffy’s middle name, but we might note that it is
also Rice’s first name.
