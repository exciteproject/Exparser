      <p>Das Institut für Höhere Studien (IHS) wurde im Jahr 1963 von zwei prominenten Exilösterreichern –
dem Soziologen Paul F. Lazarsfeld und dem Ökonomen Oskar Morgenstern – mit Hilfe der
FordStiftung, des Österreichischen Bundesministeriums für Unterricht und der Stadt Wien gegründet und ist
somit die erste nachuniversitäre Lehr- und Forschungsstätte für die Sozial- und
Wirtschaftswissenschaften in Österreich. Die Reihe Politikwissenschaft bietet Einblick in die Forschungsarbeit
der Abteilung für Politikwissenschaft und verfolgt das Ziel, abteilungsinterne Diskussionsbeiträge einer
breiteren fachinternen Öffentlichkeit zugänglich zu machen. Die inhaltliche Verantwortung für die

Since the Treaty of Maastricht transparency and openness have been prominent catchwords
to counter the European Union’s (EU) so called ‘democratic deficit’. The working paper
discusses the rank and position of these principles in democratic theory and looks at their
realisation at the EU level. Since the EU-bodies equal transparency and openness mainly
with access to information the paper concentrates on the question, which institution is willing
to provide best for access to documents. In the course of shaping a new regulation on
access to documents in May 2001, the contrasting views of Commission, European
Parliament and Council showed up in their respective draft proposals. The different
proposals are analysed and assessed with regard to transparency and openness.</p>

      <title>Zusammenfassung</title>
      <p>Seit dem Vertrag von Maastricht dienen die Begriffe “Transparenz” und “Offenheit” als
beliebte Schlagwörter, um dem sogenannten Demokratiedefizit der Europäischen Union
(EU) zu begegnen. Das Working Paper widmet sich dem Stellenwert dieser Prinzipien in der
Demokratietheorie und zeichnet ihre Implementierung auf EU-Ebene nach. Da die
EUInstitutionen Transparenz und Offenheit hauptsächlich mit Zugang zu Informationen
gleichsetzen, konzentriert sich die Analyse auf die Frage, welche Institution für den
bestmöglichsten Zugang eintritt. Im Mai 2001 wurde eine neue Verordnung über den Zugang
der Öffentlichkeit zu Dokumenten verabschiedet. Die Vorschläge, die im Vorfeld von
Kommission, Europäischem Parlament und Rat erstellt wurden, dienen in der vorliegenden
Arbeit als Grundlage zur Analyse der unterschiedlichen Interpretationen von Transparenz
und Offenheit.

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>Since the early 1990s scholarly debate and political rhetoric has increasingly concentrated
on the issue of democratization of the European Union. This shift in perspective is mainly
due to the “organic and evolutionary way” (Westlake 1998: 127) of the Union’s development.
Along with the increase in communitarized policy fields and a growing number of decisions
taking place at the European level, the question of legitimacy in the European Union
substantially gained in importance. Although the single Member States continue to enjoy
democratic legitimacy of policy-making in the national arena by well-established
mechanisms, the fusion of national and supranational policies is attended with deficiencies in
legitimacy. This became obvious with rising popular discontent accompanying the shaping of
the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
      <p>One of the solutions offered by the European Union to counter the so-called ‘democratic
deficit’ has been the call for more transparency and openness in the working of the European
Union’s institutions and the decision-making at the European level. In the EU’s actual steps
to increase transparency and openness, the notion of these principles has been mainly
realized in access to information. ‘An ever closer Union’ where decisions are taken ‘as open
as possible’ seemed achievable by changing the ways of how to grant citizens access to
documents. But how open is ‘open as possible’?
Since the EU equals openness and transparency mainly with access to information the
relevant provisions may reveal how these principles are implemented. The issue in question
has been put once more on the EU-agenda recently. Following the obligations of the
Amsterdam Treaty, the Council in codecision with the European Parliament agreed on a new
regulation on access to documents in May 2001. Until then, the Commission, the Council,
and the European Parliament followed fairly the same codes of conduct. However, research
indicates that the EU bodies interpreted access to documents in different ways
(GronbechJensen 1998). The proposals issued by the Commission, the European Parliament, and the
Council allow a comparison of the present views on how to define and restrict openness and
transparency. The analysis will concentrate on the question, which EU-institution is willing to
provide best for access to information thus providing for democratic legitimacy through
transparency and openness.</p>
      <p>In the course of this paper transparency and openness will be pinned down to the specific
instrument of access to documents that is designed to fulfill a specific purpose in a specific
institutional arrangement. It will be looked at how major players in the framework of the
European Union aim to fulfill the basic ideas of these catchwords. The first part of the paper
concentrates on the rank and position of transparency and openness in democratic theory
and looks at how these principles have evolved and been realized by the main European
bodies. The second part is devoted to the comparison of the different views of Commission,
European Parliament and Council on access to documents. The findings will be finally
reassessed with regard to the implications on the democratic quality of policy-making in the
European Union.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>2. The debate on transparency and openness</title>
      <p>The discussion on transparency and openness in the European Union covers a large variety
of perspectives. In terms of a lack of democratic legitimacy, the two ideas are closely related
to an ‘information deficit’ (Lodge 1994). Transparency through information is perceived as a
major instrument to improve democracy in the EU thus not only taming the secretive nature
of the Council’s policy-making (Curtin 1995). The Council’s policy has been proven to be
disappointing when focusing on special requests for documents (Carvel 1998). Closely
related to the Council’s information policy in general is its strong position in the
intergovernmental pillars which consequently renders fields as Justice and Home Affairs
hardly accessible (de Boer 1998). The Community’s policy is generally discussed highly
critical hence advocating more transparency, openness, and visibility (Guggenbühl 1998).
Comparative research has shown that the Community’s standards do not come up to the
tradition of the Nordic countries in open government, suggesting the latter as a solution for
the Union’s problems in legitimacy (Gronbech-Jensen 1998). However, contributions from
information professionals indicate that access to information has changed for the better
(Thomson 1998). This is confirmed by historic review pointing out that transparency has
enormously improved, which is partly due to the impact of an expanded role of the European
Parliament (Westlake 1998). Transparency is nowadays seen at the very heart of ‘good
administration’ (Söderman 2000). The European Ombudsman Jacob Söderman likewise
focuses on the democratic nature of the principle. The free flow of information and ideas
between departments could very well further transparent and efficient administration which is
e.g. in the Commission highly troubled by the fact that different Directorate Generals are in a
“state of near civil war” (Lord 1998: 83). However, these approaches neglect the internal
working of an institution and its internal transparency.</p>
      <sec id="sec-4-1">
        <title>2.1. Defining transparency and openness</title>
        <p>The common denominator of these different approaches is their linking of transparency and
openness to legitimacy. They are focusing on the transparency of political institutions in their
relation to civil society, be they private individual or business interest, the media or elected
representatives. However, definitions of transparency vary among the various approaches
and stress particular features of the underlying idea. Transparency is viewed and defined
differently: ranging from a narrow perspective of simple and clear procedures up to as broad
as “effective popular access to the decision making process” (de Boer 1998: 99).
Transparency at its simplest is “the ability to look clearly through the windows of an
institution” (de Boer 1998: 105). The very idea is made clear by this metaphor: to open up
the working procedures not immediately visible to those not directly involved in order to
demonstrate the good working of an institution.</p>
        <p>Adapted to political systems, transparency is a feature in the relationship between ruler and
ruled, namely by granting “that the operation of the government is sufficiently open to public
view and simple enough in its essentials that citizens can readily understand how and what it
is doing” (Dahl 1998: 126). Given these attributes, transparency is usually used along the
same lines as openness and frequently linked to simplicity and comprehensibility. Openness
and transparency can also be viewed as slightly different concepts (see Larsson 1998: 40),
but they are usually equaled since they both refer to a certain quality. So “openness and
transparency is clearly one and the same thing (…), the activity of lifting the veil of secrecy.”
(Davis 1998: 121). Transparency and/or openness are seen as a prerequisite for modern
policy-making by adding the distinctive flavor of democratic legitimacy.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-4-2">
        <title>2.2. Transparency and openness as tools for democratic legitimacy</title>
        <p>When talking about democracy, one should bear in mind the distinction between ideal
democracy and actual democracy as Robert Dahl (1998: 26) has rightly observed. The first
provides us with requirements and goals of democracy. The second offers empirical
evidence given the restrictions of the real world. The latter can then be measured against
normative demands. Differentiating between these two perspectives may be crucial to
assess if the assumed democratic tools are suitable to achieve democratic aims and to place
them in the entirety of democratic practices. A given number of people eager to decide on a
certain type of polity may have a mixture of diffuse ideas and hopes as well as practical
considerations of the future polity in mind. Modern large scale democracies have to develop
institutional arrangements to satisfy democratic criteria, namely effective participation,
control of the agenda, voting equality, full inclusion, and enlightened understanding (Dahl
1998: 85).</p>
        <p>In the course of legitimizing the emerging EU polity, transparency has been a prominent
catchword designated to stand as one of the principles capable of rendering the European
Union more democratic. Interesting enough, the debate over transparency has mainly been
inspired by practical steps whereas “democratic theory has very little to say in this field”
(Larson 1998: 40). Transparency and openness are in general linked to individual rights as
e.g. freedom of speech, freedom of press, or the right to vote, but the principles are not at
the very heart of democratic theory. However, “classical and contemporary theories of
democracy are posited on the belief that secrecy menaces democracy, follows philosophy of
a totalitarian state” (Curtin 1998: 107). Opening up the legislative and executive procedures
is an essential for democratic policy making. Subsequently, what people learn by using these
open and comprehensible channels may help them in participating in policy making. It is in
this sense one means to achieve legitimacy according to a modern understanding of
democracy in a bundle of mechanisms. Transparency and openness are instruments to
satisfy democratic criteria, especially the ability for citizens to participate in governance and
to hold leaders accountable.</p>
        <p>Different ideal models of democracy highlight different democratic qualities inherent in
transparency and openness. Traditional representative democracy mainly stresses that
transparency allows and simplifies accountability and control of rulership. This is well
illustrated by describing transparency as follows: “[t]hus it must not be so complexly
constructed that citizens can readily understand how and, because they do not understand
their government, cannot readily hold their leaders accountable, particularly at elections”
(Dahl 1998: 126). The basic idea is that power corrupts. Those equipped with the means for
leadership should therefore be observed and scrutinized. Control is necessary in democratic
systems and “essentially about preventing abuses by those we have chosen to govern us”
(Verhoeven 2000: 2).</p>
        <p>Participatory and deliberative approaches offer a slightly different perspective by assuming
that transparency and openness promote a vivid civil society. “The reason why information
should be open and accessible in any democracy worthy of its name is to enable political
participation by citizens” (Curtin 1998: 110). This approach obliges the political elites to grant
openness in order “to create channels for the people enabling them to participate in the work
of the government” (Larsson 1998: 41). A democratic government has to be based on public
deliberation and has to dissociate from the idea of policy-making in closed circles. Access
and subsequently participation are in this line of thinking crucial, taking it for granted that
“openness in government cannot be limited to forms of parliamentary control but must
include a wide range of mechanisms enabling participation of citizens in the policy process
by means of an effective access to the process and voice within it” (Verhoeven 2000:5).
Both approaches basically rely on access to information as a tool to achieve transparency
and openness. Access to information plays a central role:
Information and the availability or accessibility of information is and remains the currency of
democracy. Without an adequate flow of information even ex post facto accountability of the
governors to the people is meaningless. It is regarded as essential to the democratic process
that individuals are able to understand the decision-making process and the means by which
the decision-makers have reached their conclusions in order to effectively evaluate
government policies and actions and to be able to choose their representatives intelligently.
An equally important objective of openness in democratic government is to enhance public
confidence in the government (Curtin 1998: 107).</p>
        <p>Apart from these two approaches that heavily rely on democratic justifications, a third can be
identified. It is rather concerned with the restrictions to transparency due to conflicting
values, namely efficiency. “Although it is certainly important that the public have access to
relevant information about administration, working in a goldfish bowl can rarely be as
efficient as working in private” (Peters 1995: 297). The basic assumption stresses that
policymaking is mainly about positive outcomes for a given population. Too much openness may
hamper negotiations and may “lead to attitudes of legalism and risk aversion” (Verhoeven
2000: 2). This view focuses on the bargaining character of policy-making. The very character
of political trade-offs makes it necessary to withhold information for some time. In order to
achieve the best possible outcome, information can be used when appropriate in the
deliberative processes. So openness as legitimizing positive quality is weakening efficiency
as a legitimizing quality.</p>
        <p>Even if efficiency is not given priority over transparency, openness is never an absolute
category in the actual shaping of political systems. Actual democratic practice has to take
into account that there may be other conflicting values, e.g. the right to privacy of individuals.
Moreover, different political systems have created different degrees of openness over time.
The variety of diverse regulations in the 15 EU Member States illustrates that a broad
spectrum of actual regulations within both democratic and efficient political systems is
possible. Transparency and openness are neither a dependent nor an independent variable,
“[a] certain type of government and a certain type of institutional arrangement will produce a
certain type of openness on the one hand, but on the other hand a certain type of openness
will affect the institutional setting” (Larsson 1998: 44).</p>

    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>3. Transparency and openness in the European Union</title>
      <p>Neither democracy nor transparency was on the agenda of the early European Community
for Coal and Steal. As Carvel puts it, the “EEC were a benevolent conspiracy by the elites of
Europe to bind their peoples and stop another war” (Carvel 1998: 56). Cooperation between
European nation states resembled an international regime with diplomatic negotiations
prevailing. However, things changed with the growing communitarization of European
policies. The shift in power relations and the evolvement of a new style of policy-making with
intermingling national and supranational levels cast shadow on usual ways how to handle
EU politics. Democratic and transparent decision-making would have been an alienated idea
in diplomatic interaction but was seen as an adequate answer to the increase in popular
discontent over the development of the European Union.</p>
      <p>The growing discrepancies due to the changes in policy making showed up in many areas
and were also highlighted with regard to access to information. In September 1992 the Dutch
Member of Parliament, Alman Metten, asked a Dutch ministry to hand over documents
concerning various ECOFIN-meetings which he considered important for his parliamentary
work. He referred to the Dutch law granting openness and argued that “Council deliberations
and decisions (...) should be subject to the law on openness, otherwise a growing area of
formerly transparent policy and decision-making will be brought out of reach of the law of
openness as well as that of democratic control.” (Metten 1998: 86f) After lengthy
deliberations the Netherlands finally refused in 1995 to release the documents stating that
the Community’s concerns and needs were in this case prior to national law.</p>
      <p>Issues of legitimacy had long been up to the single Member State, but it seemed to become
increasingly important to include related commitments and provisions in the acquis
communitaire. Transparency and Openness came first on the agenda in the early 1990s. On
15 December 1991 declaration No. 17 attached to the Maastricht Treaty confirmed, “the
Conference considers that transparency of the decision-making process strengthens the
democratic nature of the institutions and the public’s confidence in the administration” (cit. a.
Lodge 1994: 349). Transparency was used as a handy answer to rising popular concern of
what was going on at the European level. Given the qualities of transparency, one can only
admire the audacity to put transparency on the EU agenda ever. Decision-making had by
then already gained increased impact and complexity. To render the EU decision-making
process open, simple and therefore understandable seems a rather risky goal.
Nevertheless, this presumed remedy of the so called ‘democratic deficit’ was particularly
promoted by the Member States which did not want to trouble themselves to discuss the
practices of the Council and the implications of a substantial shift in decision making away
from the national level. The addressee was first of all the Commission, which was frequently
referred to as “byzantine, inaccessible and an affront to the conduct of democratic politics”
(see Lodge 1994: 345). Attacking the Commission and calling for more openness had
unintended consequences. Involuntarily, the discussion and subsequent measures to
enhance transparency and openness brought into light again the rather obscure procedures
of the Council’s internal working and decision-making.</p>
      <p>When France almost rejected the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty in its 1992 referendum
and the Danes also refused to give consent in the first referendum, increasing concern
focused on the people’s interest in the project “European Union.” Along with frequent
reference to democracy and subsidiarity as adequate tools to meet the people’s demands,
the notion of transparency was introduced. A firmly declaration stressed the aim to create „an
ever closer union among the peoples of Europe, in which decisions are taken as openly as
possible and as closely as possible to the citizen” (Article 1 (A) TEU). Transparency was
subsequently transposed into the specific instrument of access to documents with Article 255
(191a) saying that
1. Any citizen of the Union, and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered
office in a Member State, shall have a right of access to European Parliament, Council and
Commission documents, subject to the principles and the conditions to be defined in
accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3.
2. General principles and limits on grounds of public or private interest governing this right of
access to documents shall be determined by the Council, acting in accordance with the
procedure referred to in Article 251 within two years of the entry into force of the Treaty of
Amsterdam.
3. Each institution referred to above shall elaborate in its own Rules of Procedure specific
provisions regarding access to its documents.</p>
      <p>The distinctive status of the Council was acknowledged in Article 207 leaving it up to its will
to decide whether documents touched its role as legislator or not. Article 207 (151) specified
for the Council that
4. The Council shall adopt its Rules of Procedure. For the purpose of applying Article 255(3),
the Council shall elaborate in these Rules the conditions under which the public shall have
access to Council documents. For the purpose of this paragraph, the Council shall define the
cases in which it is to be regarded as acting in its legislative capacity, with a view to allowing
greater access to documents in those cases, while at the same time preserving the
effectiveness of its decision making process. In any event, when the Council acts in its
legislative capacity, the results of votes and explanations of vote as well as statements in the
minutes shall be made public.</p>
      <p>The introduction of the right to information in the context of internal rules of procedure has
provoked critical remarks (see e.g. Curtin 1998:112). The Dutch government, which regarded
the right to information as a fundamental right, lodged a plea with the European Court of
Justice (Case 58/94), but was eventually repudiated. It was therefore up to the body’s
internal code of conduct how to shape transparency.</p>
      <p>Following the Treaty’s obligations, the different EU bodies made up their own regulations on
access to documents. The Council adopted a code of conduct concerning public access to
Council and Commission documents in December 1993, which was adopted by the
Commission in February 1994. The European Parliament implemented a similar system in
1997. Moreover, the Treaty of Amsterdam fixed that a regulation on access to documents of
all three bodies should be adopted under the codecision procedure within two years of entry
into force of the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>
      <p>None of the bodies has committed itself to absolute transparency. The Commission’s and the
Council’s code of conduct listed several exceptions including public interest, individual
privacy, commercial and industrial secrecy as well as the Community’s financial interests.
Access to documents was likewise denied if requested by the supplier, were it a Member
State or another third party. Documents also remained confidential if the EU-body claimed an
interest in the confidentiality of the proceedings. The European Parliament decided to refuse
access to documents of certain parliamentary meetings in order to protect the confidentiality
of deliberations of political groups. The rather narrow definition of the Commission and the
Council has been challenged on various occasions. The subsequent judgments of the
European Courts and the investigations of the European Ombudsman can be regarded as
an invitation to reconsider the practice of the institutions.</p>
      <p>Most of the refusals to grant access referred to the confidentiality of the proceedings. In
Guardian versus Council (Case T–194/94) the English newspaper demanded documents
concerning Justice and Agricultural Councils without success. The decision of the Court of
First Instance turned the Council’s position down and ordered the release of these
documents. Moreover, it stressed the necessity of an accurate balancing test guaranteeing
that the interest of citizens to get hold of documents should be carefully examined against
the needs of internal proceedings. The same idea was expressed in WWF UK versus
Commission (Case T–105/95). The Court conceded that certain documents out of a bundle
might be withhold but that those which failed the balancing test should be handed over to the
applicant. The discrepancies between Member State’s practice and the Council’s position
were again highlighted when Swedish journalists demanded documents relating to Europol.
Sweden handed over 18 out of 20 documents, the Council only 4. The Swedish journalists
lodged a plea before the Council of First Instance (Svenska Journalistförbundet versus
Council, T–174/95) and the Court finally annulled the Council’s decision for not sufficiently
reasoning the refusal. Generally, the judgments of the European Court suggest a careful
examination of requests on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, the Court has frequently taken
the side of applicants who were denied access to documents by the EU institutions. Its
judgments therefore have “broadened the scope of access rights” (Verhoeven 2000: 9).
Another way to reassess the interpretations of the rules of conduct is by complaining to the
European Ombudsman. He has been installed to serve as an intermediary between single
citizens and the European Union. Transparency and access to information is one of the
major tasks of the Ombudsman. His own-initiated inquiry aimed to close the loophole in
Article 255, which covers only the Commission, the Council, and the European Parliament.
The Ombudsman’s inquiry included 15 EU institutions and bodies and suggested
improvements regarding access to documents. Although his inquiries lack the virtue of law
the conclusions of the Ombudsman have some impact given the very nature of the office.
Complaints to the Ombudsman on transparency concern most of all the infringement
procedure, recruitment procedures and access to documents (see Söderman 2000). The
Ombudsman was also used to defy the Council’s restrictive dealing with documents
concerning the Third Pillar. Frequent requests on documents made by a British Journalist on
behalf of the human rights organization “StateWatch” had frequently been refused.
Since the emergence of the transparency theme access to information on EU politics has
substantially improved. Thanks to the use of electronic media, the lack of information on the
EU bodies and their working has been enormously reduced. Many bodies and institutions
nowadays offer registers of documents. Press releases, minutes and previews of the agenda
are readily available. However, comprehensive information on the working of the EU at large
or thematic information sheets rather highlight the service-orientated character of an
institution than stressing the frequently proclaimed democratic upgrading by adding
transparency. Likewise, the very idea of broadcasting Council meetings may promote the
understanding of EU policy-making, the actual programs are rather uninformative and
moreover, “flavored with propaganda” (Guggenbühl 1998: 24). “Enlightened understanding”
as a democratic criteria channeled through the intermediaries of an active civil society will
not be achieved by this means.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-6">
      <title>4. Transparency and openness in comparison</title>
      <p>The debate on the new regulation regarding public access to European Parliament, Council
and Commission documents gave the opportunity to analyze the current positions of the
three EU-bodies with regard to transparency and openness. The comparison works on the
assumption that access to information strengthens democratic legitimacy. If everybody has
access to each single document drawn up in the public administration as well as to those
documents worked out during legislative policy-making, transparency and openness are
maximized. Criteria for assessing the differences and similarities between the positions of
the EU-bodies are the question of who has access to what documents under which
conditions. However, the very nature of the EU polity causes scenarios, which go beyond the
scope of the analysis. Since legislation on access to information vary among the Member
States, an upgrading of access on the EU-level might override provisions on the national
level. Extensive access to documents on grounds of the new regulation could then lead to an
upgrading of transparency in some Member States while at the same time weakening the
right to information in others, namely the Nordic countries. The question of how to deal with
the so-called “Third party”-documents, which includes those of Member States, will be
therefore touched, too.</p>
      <p>Transparency and openness by means of access to information are frequently linked to
accountability and participation but actual democratic practice illustrates that access to
documents is always limited in one way or the other. Yet, not only the institutional
arrangement but also the nature of the institutions itself is shaping the degree of openness
and transparency. Along the lines of how much transparency may possibly be granted, the
institutional view will define how access is granted under which conditions, what kind of
information is accessible and why access is granted or denied. The institution’s culture, its
self-perception, and its inherent institutional targets will influence the degree of openness,
which is consequently defended against conflicting and concurrent positions.</p>
      <sec id="sec-6-1">
        <title>4.1. Foci of the three proposals on the regulation of access to documents</title>
        <p>
          In accordance with the EC-Treaty obligations Article 251(
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">2</xref>
          ) and 255(
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">2</xref>
          ) the Commission
issued a proposal for public access to documents of the Council, the Commission and the
European Parliament. The Commission proposal (COM (2000) 30 final/2) of 21 February
2000 was forwarded to both Parliament and Council.
        </p>
        <p>The European Parliament primarily dealt with the new regulation in several meetings of the
Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which considered
opinions of other committees, too. The Committee adopted its draft legislative resolution on
24 October 2000 by 28 votes to 4, with 2 abstentions and made it available to the public
(Doc. No. A5–0318/2000). This draft would have been subject to the vote in plenary session,
which was eventually postponed in order to open up informal meetings with both
Commission and Council.</p>
        <p>Somewhat different and highly indicative is the proceeding in the Council, which dealt with
the regulation in various sessions of the COREPER working group on information under
subsequent the Portuguese, the French and the Swedish presidency. Common positions are
much more difficult to find since the positions of each of the 15 Member States has to be
considered. Access to documents is subject to a wide range of implementation forms in
respective national legislation. Differences with regard to Member States legislation cover
the whole range between narrow definitions of openness and a very extensive practice in
granting access to documents. A review of national legislations shows that e.g. Great Britain
makes extensive use of the so-called secrecy act thus withdrawing official documents from
public scrutiny. On the opposite, the Nordic countries have long times practiced the open
government approach. The adoption of a common position at the General Affairs Committee
meeting was tabled for the end of November, then postponed to January 2001. The Swedish
Presidency’s working paper of that meeting which is the basis for comparison still reflects
internally unsettled issues.</p>
        <p>The obvious difficulties to find a compromise provoked a substantial delay in the adoption of
the new legislation. A series of informal “trilogue meetings” started at the end of January
2001 and was concluded with a compromise. The regulation was finally adopted on 30 May
2001 (Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001).</p>
        <p>The Commission’s proposal stresses in its recitals the necessity to broaden transparency
and openness, thus enabling “citizens to participate more closely in the decision-making
process, and guarantees that the administration enjoys greater legitimacy and is more
effective and more accountable vis-à-vis the citizen in a democratic system” (Comm, recital
2). It reaffirms this commitment by reminding of the European Councils of Birmingham,
Edinburgh and Copenhagen, which extensively dealt with transparency. The prime
addressee of the regulation is therefore “the citizen.” Despite this commitment, the making of
the Commission’s proposal has provoked criticism for not involving representatives of civil
society. The European Committee of the British House of Lords judged that “[a]n important
political opportunity was missed. Extensive external consultation would have demonstrated
commitment to openness. It might have gone some way to restore to the institution some of
the legitimacy and credibility it lost with the collapse of the Santer Commission.”1 However,
the draft confirms the will to shape the European Union as a democratic system. The
principle of openness shall guarantee civic participation and accountability.</p>
        <p>Apart from the rights of Member States, the scope of the Parliament’s regulation is much
broader than that of the Commission. Specific rules on access only stay in force if they
provide more access. The parliament intends an extensive approach including remarks on
future provisions on access to documents: “On the same basis, the present regulation is the
legal framework for existing and future interinstitutional agreements in relation to methods of
drafting laws, content and format of the Official Journal, managing and storing documents
with a view to granting access, and guidelines on the rules on modalities for access to
documents” (EP, recital 3).</p>
        <p>With regard to the principal motivation of the regulation on access to documents this draft
shows other focal points. The proposal makes reference to the acquis communitaire and
declaration 17 as well as the Charta of Fundamental Rights. It stresses in its justification to
recital 0 that “[a] truly democratic debate cannot develop in the European Union without open
institutions” and promotes the right of information. Transparency through access to
documents suffices another principle by granting protection “against the arbitrary use of and
the abuse of power and against corruption and fraud” (EP, recital 2). The draft is clearly
aimed at the citizen and the general public.</p>
        <p>The Council’s working paper issued under Swedish presidency2 reflects a rapprochement
between the Member States and makes some concessions to the European Parliament’s
draft. The position of the Council diverges however from those of Commission and the
European Parliament. The draft confirms in its recitals the principle of openness and
transparency as a means to achieve greater legitimacy, effectiveness and accountability. It
follows the Commission’s wording in saying that “[o]penness enables citizens to participate
more closely in the decision-making process and guarantees that the administration enjoys
greater legitimacy and is more effective and more accountable to the citizen in a democratic
system” (Council, recital 2). The aim is “to widen access to documents as far as possible”
1 House of Lords, European Communities Committee, Sixteenth Report: Public Access to EU Documents, HL
2 1N0o2n;e1oAfutghuestw2o0r0k0ing papers and drafts of the Council was accessible through the Council's register of
documents. However, several documents were played into the hands of the British human rights organization
StateWatch which made them available to the public via Internet (www.statewatch.org)
(Council, recital 4). However, the Council makes special reference to Article 255(3) in
proclaiming that Council’s documents concerning legislative issues should be more
accessible “while at the same time preserving the effectiveness of their decision-making
process” (Council, recital 6).</p>

      <sec id="sec-6-2">
        <title>4.2. Transparency in perspective</title>
        <p>Getting information is a way of empowerment in terms of democratic citizenship. Access to
documents therefore centers on the question how much access is granted. This includes
definitions of those who benefit as well as procedures on access. Another important criterion
is the scope of access. The accessibility of documents refers both to the stage in the
policymaking cycle as well as to policy fields. A rather special case due to the nature of the
European Union has to be considered, too. The multi-level system offers multiple points of
access, notably the EU-institutions and the Member States. The question of how to deal
judicially with this configuration cannot be assessed in terms of more or less access since
national provisions vary. Whether Member States have the final say in the disclosure of
documents originating from a nation state or not rather touches the question of weakening
the Member States or strengthening the European Union’s impact.</p>
        <sec id="sec-6-2-1">
          <title>4.2.1. Beneficiaries of the regulation</title>
          <p>
            The provision on who should be entitled to access shows little divergences. Beneficiaries
shall be all Union citizens, all enterprises having their office within the territory of the EU, and
all legal residents. The Parliament’s as well as the Council’s drafts exceed this right to
nonEU natural or legal persons although the wording indicates that this right is not enforceable.
This is a slight but however important improvement towards more openness since namely
accession states may have a strong interest to get hold of certain EU-documents. All three
proposals in principle agree that no reason has to be given by the applicant as far as his
specific interest is concerned. However, only the European Parliament’s position is without
reservation: “The institution concerned may ask the applicant for further details regarding the
application” (Comm, par. 5.1). A similar wording is used in the Councils respective paragraph
(Council, par. 3A(
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">2</xref>
            )). The wording of both the Commission’s and the Council’s proposal open
a backdoor to revise this principle, whereas the Parliament’s draft defines rather narrowly
that asking back is only possible “for the purposes of identifying the documents” (EP, par.
5.1). The European Parliament’s draft does not mention large documents or repeated
requests whereas both Commission and Council consider these cases and make specific
provisions. A specific rule applies in case of large documents or repeated requests. The
Council follows the suggestions of the Commission saying that “[i]n the event of general and
repetitive applications or applications relating to very large documents or a very large
number of documents, the institution concerned may confer with the applicant informally,
with a view to finding a fair solution” (Council, par. 3a(3)).
Speeding up the process of application is seen as a citizen-orientated approach by the
Parliament. Whereas the Commission sets a time limit of one month to reply to an initial
application, the Parliament’s approach reduces the answering time to two weeks and
demands to hand over at the same time the requested documents in case of a positive
decision (EP, par. 5.2). The Council’s draft expresses its commitment that applications “shall
be handled promptly” (Council, par 5.1), but leans on the Commission’s position of a
deadline for response limited to one month.
          </p>
          <p>As far as requests for documents are concerned, each draft foresees in its paragraph 5 a
fairly similar procedure. If the application is not accepted, the applicant is entitled to make a
confirmatory request. If this request is turned down, the institution has to inform about
possible remedies, namely a complaint to the Ombudsman or the lodging of the complaint
with the European Court of Justice. The Council’s proposal foresees however that
“[c]onfirmatory applications for sensitive documents shall be handled only by those persons
who have a right to acquaint themselves with those documents according to the internal
rules of the institution concerned” (Council, par. 6(1)). The European Parliament takes a
somehow different view by demanding, “[p]arliamentary scrutiny of all documents excluded
from public access shall be assured by regularly informing a body of the European
Parliament” (EP, par. 7).</p>

          <title>4.2.2. Proactive measures</title>
          <p>
            In its efforts to shape the regulation on access as an overall guideline on the future access to
information, the European Parliament’s proposal embraces the detailed handling of registers,
unlike the Commission’s initial draft. Although many bodies and institutions of the European
Union already offer registers accessible by the Internet, the European Parliament sets great
store of regulating this point specifically and incorporates a proactive approach to information
on documents. It suggests therefore the installation of a register for each institution. These
have to include at a minimum “all documents created by that institution in the course of a
procedure for the adoption of legally binding measures, notably all proposals, opinions,
working documents, agendas, documents for discussion at formal meetings, minutes,
declarations and positions of Member States” (EP, par. 9a(3)). The register has to list those
documents that are excluded from access indicating reasons for exclusion (EP, par. 9a(
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">2</xref>
            )).
Apart from that, these documents have to be incorporated in the public register from the
moment of time a decision has been made or at the moment a document is sent to others
like third parties, institutions or internal bodies (EP, par 9a(1)). Whenever possible
documents shall be available directly thus creating registers as an interface between the
institutions and citizens.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Council follows this approach by stating that this would “make the citizens’ rights arising
from this Regulation effective” (Council par. 9a(1)). Differing from the EPs position the
Council simply demands a short description of the content. A huge difference shows up in
the treatment of documents subject to exceptions: “Reference shall not be made if disclosure
of the reference could undermine the protection of information provided for in Article 4”
(Council, par. 9a(
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">2</xref>
            )). Sensitive documents are excluded likewise.
          </p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="sec-6-2-5">
          <title>4.2.3. Scope of the regulation</title>
          <p>
            The regulation is intended to encompass “all documents held by an institution, that is to say,
documents drawn up by it or received from third parties and in its possession, in all areas of
activity of the European Union” (Council, par. 1(
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">2</xref>
            )). The European Parliament makes a point
in stressing that ‘all areas’ refers to the 2nd and 3rd pillar as well. The Council agrees on that
with certain reservations stating that sensitive documents shall get a special treatment.
Commission, Parliament and Council are generous as far as the type of medium is
concerned. Written as well as electronic or sound, visual or audiovisual-recorded information
may be requested. Generosity stops here, and the approaches to exceptions vary
significantly in various fields. In case of the future EU-regulation, the European Parliament
offers the smallest number of exceptions. The draft foresees that access to documents can
be denied if disclosure could significantly undermine public security, monetary stability,
defense and military matters, and vital interest relating to the EU’s international relations (EP,
par. 4(1a)). Individual privacy is likewise protected. Commercial secrecy is mentioned under
the European Parliament’s exceptions, too, but has to be balanced against private or public
interest in case of disclosure. However, the European Parliament sets certain limits to the
protection by demanding that a classification is done immediately and shall be limited in
time. If access is denied for an unlimited period of time, the reason for withholding has to be
revised regularly (EP, par. 3a(
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">2</xref>
            )).
          </p>
          <p>The Commission’s initial proposal gives a much longer and detailed list of exceptions
including “the effective functioning of the institutions” (Comm, par. 4(1a)). This draft does not
require a “balancing test” as the European Parliament’s proposal does. The Council’s
position is similar to that of the Commission, but is outstanding in stating “[a]ccess to a
document which relates to a matter where the decision has not been taken by the Institutions
may be denied if its disclosure could seriously undermine the Institution’s decision-making
process, unless it is clearly in the public interest to disclose the document” (Council, par.
4.2).</p>
          <p>The Commission suggests likewise excluding “texts for internal use such as discussion
documents, opinions of departments, and excluding informal messages” (Comm par. 3a).
The two other concurrent drafts take also account of the so-called ‘space to think’ clause.
The Parliament’s draft limits its exceptions however to documents intended for exchange of
idea and brainstorming. The ‘space to think’ is limited to “informal information in the form of
written messages which serves the provision of personal opinion or the free exchange of
ideas (“brain storming”) within the institutions” (EP, par. 3a). The Council’s proposal
resembles the approach of the Commission in its subsequent paragraph, excluding
documents “for internal use as part of preliminary consultations and deliberations within the
institutions such as discussion documents, unfinished documents or draft documents and
documents whose content reflects personal opinions” (Council, par. 3a). The European
Parliament chooses obviously the most restrictive wording, but leaves broad space for future
interpretation, too.</p>
          <p>Another source of divergence is the definition of those bodies subject to the proposed
regulation. Following the obligations of the Amsterdam Treaty, access to documents of the
Council, the European Parliament and the Commission has to be considered. The Council’s
draft makes no further provisions on that subject. Both Commission and EP define the
respective bodies more precisely. The EP mentions the “internal and subsidiary bodies (such
as Parliament Committees, Council Committees, Working Groups and Commission
Directorates-General)” (EP, par. 3b). The Commission’s draft is even more precise, citing
each body and the main subbodies (Comm, par. 3c,d,e). It also views the EP’s political
groups within the reach of the regulation, a provision that is missing in the EP’s draft.</p>

          <title>4.2.4. Documents involving 3rd parties</title>
          <p>A special point due to the nature of the EU polity is the insertion of provisions concerning
third parties. Whereas the definition of third parties remains the same for all three proposals
saying that ‘third party’ shall mean “any natural or legal person, or any entity outside the
institution, including the Member States, other Community and non-Community institutions
and bodies and non-member countries” (Comm, par. 3f, EP, par. 3f, Council, par. 3c), the
question of how to handle documents originating from third parties is contested. The crucial
point is, of course, the role of the Member States. The Commission suggests to grant
confidentiality according to the preferences of a Member State (Comm, par. 3d) and to apply
the regulation only for documents sent to the institutions after entry in force of the regulation
(Comm, par. 2 (1)). The European Parliament turns down this approach fearing an
undermining of the future regulation. It therefore suggests that Member States and other
third parties shall indicate reasons for withholding on the grounds of the exceptions laid
down in the EU-regulation on public access. The institution even has the right to decide
against the wishes of the third party but is at the same time under obligation to grant a
certain space of time to give the opportunity to search for legal intervention (EP, par. 4c). The
Council’s definite position on this point was not available for comparative analysis. In the
recital it is however laid down that Declaration No 35 attached to the Final Act of the Treaty
“will allow a Member State to request the Commission or the Council not to communicate to
third parties a document originating from that State without its prior agreement” (Council,
recital 9).
Another possible scenario for request is not covered by the Commission’s proposal although
it has proven to be a touchstone between the Community institutions and a Member State.
The case of Sweden, releasing more documents under its presidency than the Council, has
highlighted the problematic nature of divergent information policies. The European
Parliament provides in this case that “the Member State shall immediately inform the
institution” (EP, par. 4d) but leaves it up to the Member State whether to disclose or not on
grounds of national legislation. In its justifications the European Parliament however
expresses the hope that the Member States respect the “spirit of loyal cooperation.” The
Council’s common position with regard to this point remains contested and unclear. The
wording, which does not get the agreement of all Member States, provides that the Member
State “should forward it promptly to this institution for a decision to be taken” (Council, recital
14).</p>

      <sec id="sec-6-3">
        <title>4.3. The three proposals in terms of openness and transparency</title>
        <p>When assessing the three positions offered by Commission, Parliament and Council, one
observes apparent differences in the shaping of openness and transparency. The European
Parliament clearly takes the most far-reaching position on granting access to documents. It
reaffirms the commitment of ready-at-hand information by introducing not only the shortest
time limit for answering to requests. It also offers the most detailed provisions concerning
public registers in terms of quick and extensive availability. The proposal is much more
generous towards repeated requests than the concurrent drafts. These are treated the same
way as all other requests. This is especially important given the aims that are to be fulfilled
by transparency and openness. The institutionalization of a European public sphere depends
on evolving intermediaries, which work on a regular basis. Interest groups, the media as well
as scientific research therefore need the possibility to access information without
discrimination.</p>
        <p>The European Parliament’s draft is also far reaching with regard to the type of document.
Though the relevant provisions are somehow vague, the Parliament is clearly more
ambitious in granting access to as many documents as possible. This is especially important
for those papers drawn up in the initial stages of the policy-making cycle. Public availability
of internal documents allows an active participation in policy making as well as
accompanying control thus not only relying on ex-post accountability. The proposal is firm in
avoiding provisions, which would allow escaping from the regulation by including all three
pillars. It therefore denies the setting up of special codes of access granting less access than
once established. Wherever the necessity to withhold documents is conceded by its
proposal, the Parliament urges a balancing between conflicting interests. A regular revision
of classified documents shall moreover grant the strict commitment to the principle ‘as open
as possible’.</p>
        <p>The Commission’s and the Council’s position are in contrast less open than the European
Parliament’s, although different points are highlighted. Both grant a degree of openness and
transparency that is not conducive to civic participation and even renders ex post
accountability more difficult. The Commission’s proposal encompasses the existing
subbodies and by doing so, follows the same principles as the Parliament. In deviation from the
Council’s position it restricts beneficiaries to legal and natural persons residing in the
European Union and is, therefore, less open than the Council. As far as the scope of the
future regulation is concerned, the Commission stresses the importance of granting
confidentiality in order to ensure the effective functioning of the institutions. Internal
documents are therefore largely covered by exceptions restricting access. A ‘harm test’ to
balance the applicants interest in disclosure towards the institution’s interest in confidentiality
is in no case provided.</p>
        <p>The Council is even more restrictive than the Commission. The Council is less concerned
with internal “space to think”-provisions but considers the confidentiality of the
decisionmaking process. Although a ‘harm test’ is foreseen for internal documents concerning issues
where a decision has not yet been taken, it is restrictive in another area. It reaffirms its
commitment to include documents of all areas but foresees at the same time special
procedures for sensitive documents. This attitude is extended to the provisions on public
registers. Online registers, which list all documents and provide for direct access to the
actual paper, would enormously improve opportunities for participation and accountability
throughout Europe. The establishment of such registers would allow individuals and interest
groups, which are not located at Brussels to bridge the geographic distance and monitor EU
politics. Yet, the Council neglects the European Parliament’s considerations on speedy and
comprehensive access to registers. Even more important, it restricts the cases to be listed in
registers therefore hampering even ex post accountability. The Council is as restricted as the
Commission in treating repeated requests or applications for large documents in a special
way.</p>
        <p>Gronbech-Jensen stresses that the Commission has adopted several measures to
strengthen transparency since Amsterdam, e.g. by involving organized interests. By doing
so, it went much further than the Council (Gronbech-Jensen 1998: 191). However, when
focusing on public access to documents only, these findings have to be reconsidered. It is
mainly the European Parliament which acts as a motor for more transparency whereas the
Commission’s and the Council’s attitude reflect reservation on public access to documents.</p>
      </sec>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-7">
      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>Transparency and openness as tools for democratic legitimacy stress the importance of
open, simple, and comprehensible policy-making. They are seen as prerequisites to hold
political leaders and administrative bodies accountable. Transparency and openness may
also prompt civic participation by allowing direct engagement in politics. The most basic
instrument to enhance transparency and openness is granting extensive access to
information. Access to information enables citizens and civic intermediaries to scrutinize the
political processes and to engage in them either directly or by means of public debate.
Access to information has been one of the means designed to strengthen the legitimacy of
the EU-polity. Since Amsterdam, this approach has been pursued and improvements in the
information policy and accessibility of the European Union through civil society have been
achieved.</p>
      <p>The final shaping of the regulation on access would be subject to yet another paper. 3 In any
case, when studying the different suggestions on the regulation regarding public access to
European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, current institutional views on
transparency and openness turn out to be somehow dissatisfying. The different drafts of
Parliament, Commission, and Council reflect the aim to protect the institution’s most vital and
sensitive areas. The European Parliament is eager to exclude documents concerning party
deliberations, the Commission tries to shield internal administrative documents as far as
possible and the Council is anxious to protect its decision-making process. The comparison
of the drafts on the European Union’s regulation on public access to European Parliament,
Council and Commission documents shows that there is no overall perception and
conception of democracy, and eventual compromises will continue to reflect these
ambiguities.</p>
      <p>3 For in-depth analysis of the regulation see e.g. Jacobs 2001
Even very open systems like the Swedish one do exclude documents from public scrutiny for
various reasons. Taking this into account, the European Parliament’s position is still the most
far reaching with regard to an opening up the policy-making process by means of granting
access to documents. It suggests a speedy procedure, has no reservations on beneficiaries
and provides for extensive access to documents in almost all phases of the policy cycle and
in many policy fields. It is consequently outstanding in granting opportunities for both
accountability and participation. Commission and Council, in contrast, rely more heavily on
internal deliberations, which have to be protected up to some degree against the outside
world. The Council even renders ex post accountability more difficult. In following the
philosophy of diplomat’s secret deliberations, the Council provides for opportunities to hide
the very existence of documents. Hopefully, the strengthening of the Parliament’s position
has positive effects on better opportunities for civil society. It challenges contrasting views as
represented by Commission and Council and may well have some impact on existing power
relations, inherent attitudes and final political outcome.</p>
      <p>Transparency and openness are double-edged weapons. If people use the channels open to
them, they may eventually conclude that they do not agree to what is going on in day-to-day
politics. An upgrading of democratic legitimacy by granting more access to information may
then have delegitimizing effects. Output-orientated approaches, stressing that democratic
legitimacy is best achieved by providing optimal political outcome, namely rules and laws on
behalf of the people’s demand, will remain sceptical about the positive effects of participation
and accountability through the highest possible degree of transparency and openness.
Conversely, one has to put up with possible unintended consequences of transparency if a
political system is to be created as a ‘democracy by the people’ instead of a ‘democracy for
the people’.</p>
