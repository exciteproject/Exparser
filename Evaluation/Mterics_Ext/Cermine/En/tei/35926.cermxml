        <p>This study has two aims: firstly to examine the general pattern of works councillor attitudes towards management in the East German textile industry; secondly to investigate the effectiveness of these works councils in representing workers' interests. A survey of works councillors in over fifty mostly privatised textile firms provided some initial indication that they have a cautious, co-operative attitude towards management and are surely not „extended arms of management“ as has been often declared in the literature. Moreover, a survey of the unionised workers in these firms revealed an overwhelming acceptance of their works councils and a conviction that the limited effectiveness of these institutions is mainly caused by the current economic constraints rather than by internal deficiencies of the new institutions.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>
        Works councils were forbidden during the socialist regime but have been widely
established following the transfer of the (West) German industrial relations system into
the East in 1990
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22 ref28">(see Jander and Lutz 1991; Kirschner 1991)</xref>
        .1 The development of
works councils in East Germany after Unification has been a popular topic of industrial
relations research in the last five years
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43 ref44 ref46 ref7 ref8">(e.g. Dathe and Schreiber 1993; David 1992;
Mickler and Walker 1992; Röske and Wassermann 1991; SOFI Göttingen [e.g. Bluhm,
Kern and Land, Kirschner, Voßkamp and Wittke]; Berlin/Göttingen group [Kädtler,
Kottwitz, Jander, Lutz, Rosenbaum, Weinert]; WISOC Chemnitz [e.g. Ermischer,
Kreißig, Lungwitz, Preusche])</xref>
        . Although much interesting work has been done, there
are perhaps two deficiencies. The first is at the methodological level. The published
research is almost entirely based on expert interviews and/or case studies of specific
companies. More representative, quantitative studies have yet to be undertaken. The
second deficiency is on a contextual level. Although it has been frequently argued that
employees are crucial actors at workplace level, there are still no broadly-based,
quantitative studies of their attitudes, opinions or behaviour at this level.
      </p>
      <p>This paper addresses these deficiencies in a study of workplace relations in the
East German textile industry. Two main issues are discussed. Firstly, it examines the
pattern of works councillor attitudes towards management through a questionnaire.
Secondly and perhaps more importantly, it investigates the extent to which works
councils are effective in representing workers interests. This will be discussed by
analysing the perceptions of unionized workers towards their own works councils.
The paper starts by reviewing the relevant literature on workplace relations in East
Germany.

      <title>Co-operative Workplace Relations or Works Councils as „Extended Arms of Management“?</title>
      <p>
        Research on East German workplace relations commonly distinguishes between
the period before and the period after privatisation of the East German enterprises,2
since privatisation is seen as having a radical impact on workplace relations
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref7">(e.g.
Dathe and Schreiber 1993: 6; Ermischer and Preusche 1992; Hürtgen 1992)</xref>
        . With
regard to the first period, one may distinguish two views. The first argues that the
relationship between management and works council was typically essentially
cooperative, whilst the second argues that it was one in which the works council was
typically subservient.
1
2
      </p>
      <p>
        The West German Works Constitution Act (BetrVG 1972), the legal foundation of works
councils, was introduced on June 1st 1990 before the political Unification (October 1990).
The East German (state) industry was privatised through the Treuhandanstalt Berlin, the state
privatisation agency, which started its work in 1991. The Treuhand took over the assets and
liabilities (over 100 Mrd Deutsche Mark) of the East German industry (combines). In 1992
the Treuhand had responsibility for over 5.100 companies (Treuhand prospectus
„Entsc
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">hlossen Sanieren“ 1992</xref>
        : 17). In the end of 1994/beginning of 1995 the Treuhand had
completed its work of privatising most of the firms and was dissolved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Analysts in the first tradition see the enterprise as being characterized by a
cooperative relationship, i.e. „co-management“
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(Ermischer and Preusche 1993)</xref>
        or
„partnership for progress/construction“ („Aufbaupartnerschaft“)
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">(Röske and
Wassermann 1991)</xref>
        , and they offer three main reasons.
      </p>
      <p>Firstly, the legacy of former socialisation and „collective“ experiences in
socialist workplaces (e.g. life-long employment in the same firm, everyone knowing
each other, and with no extreme social status differences between management and
workers) is said to enhance co-operation.</p>
      <p>
        Secondly, there is said to have been a particular inter-dependence between
management and works councils: both parties had an equal status in the beginning,
even that management was sometimes in a weaker situation since it had to earn/
regain legitimacy from the workforce (i.e. unclarified power relations, i.e. „power
vacuum“ [Mac
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">htvakuum]) (e.g. Kirschner 1992</xref>
        : 85). Consequently, it is claimed that
management was dependent on the works council to get the support of the workforce
for any restructuring. Moreover, both parties faced radical challenges from the
internal and external environments. It is argued that this worked as a force for
cooperative relations in order to have at least one stabilizing factor during the difficult
survival process. According to Ermischer and Preusche (1995: 55) „the co-operation
enhanced the plant level process of transformation and helped to compensate for the
lack of experience of both management and the works council with the strange
economic and legal system“. One should also note that the common „enemy“, the
Treuhand (the state privatisation agency) arguably induced „emergency associations“
(Notgemeinschaften).
      </p>
      <p>
        Thirdly, there was the particularly unifying aim of (a) preparing the enterprise for
the market economy
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(e.g. Dathe and Schreiber 1993: 9)</xref>
        , and (b) of dismantling the
political structures, i.e. „de-ideologisation“ of the work structure and organisation (e.g.
getting rid of the „red socks“). Some even argue that there has been a third unifying
aim, the development of more employee involvement
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(Ermischer and Preusche 1992: 2)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        In sum, these authors conclude that co-management generally emerged in their
case study companies because of the specific internal situations after the „Wende“
(turnaround). Ermischer and Preusche's empirical investigation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32 ref37">(interviews in 34
companies of mostly the metal industry in Saxony from 1991 onwards)</xref>
        bases its
conclusion on the finding that in the majority of cases the management and works
council saw their relationship as a positive, co-operative relationship with the aim of
achieving consensus (1993: 185).
      </p>
      <p>It is a weakness of these studies that we are not told which interview questions
were asked, nor are important terms like „co-operation“ clearly defined. For example,
the perception of „shared goals“ does not necessarily lead to an effective
codetermination, i.e. co-operation. It is also possible that if a works council shares the
same goals as management, it does not see the need to become pro-active.</p>
      <p>
        This view is supported by the other school of thought on these issues who propose
that co-operative works councils in East Germany are „extended arms of management“
rather than „independent“ and effective worker institutions. Some of their arguments
will be reviewed: Jander and Lutz (1991: 411) of the Berlin/Göttingen group found in
their surveys3 that cases of pro-active works councils were the exception rather than the
rule, and they speculate that these were likely to have been concentrated around Leipzig
and Dresden (the home of the civil movement). They also found that even in the
beginning, when works councils formally attended management meetings, they did not
participate greatly in the decision making, but basically agreed to decisions which
sounded economically rational. For example, there was no works council in their sample
which had developed alternatives to management's reconstruction concept. In general,
works councillors were found to be very open to economic arguments because of their
belief that economic irrationality led the former system into ruin. Economic rationality
and especially technological progress were often seen as panaceas
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7 ref8">(also Dathe and
Schreiber 1993: 42; David 1992: 132-134)</xref>
        . Mickler et al.'s case study of VW gives an
impressive account of the works council's agreement to the introduction of lean
production wit
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">hout any restrictions (1992</xref>
        : 16). Moreover, according to Jander and Lutz
(ibid.) East German works councils generally did not (and still do not) mobilize against
staff reductions, because they are accepted as unavoidable, and avoid any politicisation
of labour relations, since this is seen as a core reason for the old mis-management.
Consequently, as Kädtler and Kottwitz (1994: 27) argue, the „works council as a
partner/arm of management“ is often believed by works councillors themselves to be the
ideal type (see Kotthoff's typology below). Accordingly, as the authors conclude, the
relationship between management and works council is not seen by the councillors as
the expression of any fundamental conflict of interest but as a „functional
complementary relationship“. Similarly, their study found that works councils, having
realized that their scope for action is very limited, were persuaded that co-operation is
the best posture. The authors mention that „it is not the announcement of a third or
fourth redundancy round which causes a 'hardening of the fronts' but instead the times
when management violates the rights of the works council or is guilty of negligence“
(p.28). Thus, only when informal norms were violated, did the works council become
„aggressive“.4
      </p>
      <p>Jander and Lutz also remark that the early attendance of the works council at
board meetings in some firms could easily be seen more as a management strategy to
get the workers to accept organisational changes than as an indicator of
comanagement. In addition, Kädtler (1992: 8-10) cannot find any evidence to suggest that
3
4</p>
      <p>
        Expert interviews and documentary work in 40 companies in Saxony and Thüringen during the
unification period (1989/90) and six intensive longitudinal case studies (mainly from interviews
with works councils) in these regions, plus equivalent investigations around Berlin (22
companies) till 1992/3
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22 ref26">(see Jander and Lutz 1991; Kädtler and Kottwitz 1994)</xref>
        make up their
empirical underpinning. Most companies were of the metal, chemical or electronics industry.
The author of the present article observed the same in a chemical company which she visited
in Bitterfeld in 1993. It experienced mass redundancies without any interference from the
works council or workforce, but when management once violated a specific legal
(information) right of the works council, the works council organized an immediate walkout.
there were conflicts in the early period (Winter 1989) in those enterprises, which had
quite extensive rights for their works councils, over the introduction of the more
restrictive German works councils law. He goes so far as to argue that even if the
broader participation rights had been kept, the outcome of „co-management“ would
have been the same, largely due to the particular economic and political context.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is more agreement among analysts as the quality of workplace relations
after privatisation. The workforce, works council and management no longer jointly
face the Treuhand in safeguarding the interests of the enterprise. It is argued that the
classic division of interests between capital and labour therefore becomes more
explicit
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12 ref36">(Ermischer and Preusche 1995: 59; Lungwitz and Preusche 1994)</xref>
        . Workplace
relations become characterized on the one side by management strengthening its
position (e.g. legitimized by new owners or by a management buy-out), and
frequently reinforcing „taylorist“ control and disciplinary methods
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35 ref44 ref48 ref5">(e.g. Bluhm 1992;
Lippold et al. 1992; Voskamp and Wittke 1991)</xref>
        . On the other side the deteriorating
economic situation is regarded as to reduce the task of works councils to that of
administrating redundancies instead of „co-managing“ the on-going reorganisation.
For example, Mickler et al.'s case study (e.g. 1992) of the new Volkswagen car
factory in Saxony showed that the informal „survival pacts“ which existed in 1990
were starting to fall apart by 1992: management wanted more productivity and the
workforce wanted to keep their traditional piece rates and customs. Thus, Mickler et
al. write that it is „not the democratisation of workplace relations, but company’s
survival, massive redundancies and the securing of a minimum social standard
[which] determines the daily wor
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref34">k of the councils“ (1993</xref>
        : 21). Finally, it is argued
that privatisation often leads to the employment of West German or foreign managers
who are likely to challenge the established East German community
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">(see Aderhold et
al. 1994)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>In sum, the literature on workplace relations in East German enterprises before
privatisation can be categorized into two broad camps, a positive/optimistic one (e.g.
WISOC) who propose co-operative (and effective) works councils, and a negative/
pessimistic one (e.g. Berlin/Göttingen). Obviously, these two groups are „ideal
types“. Both sides however agree that there has been a shift and deterioration in
works council-management relations over the years.</p>
      <p>The characterisation by some researchers of early workplace relations as
cooperative would be enhanced by a precise definition of concepts such as
„cooperation“ or „co-management“. Was it „real“ co-operation, say between two equally
strong partners,5 or a more one-sided acquiescence on the part of the works council?
Furthermore, the argument that „co-operation“ has declined since privatisation does
not say what it has been substituted by. Does „non-co-operation“ mean a conflictual
relationship or does it mean that the works council becomes (or continues to be) an
extended arm of management, thus administering management functions, as
5</p>
      <p>
        Co-operation is often defined differently, e.g. that people willingly co-operate because of
mutual gains
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">(see Axelrod 1990)</xref>
        .
Mahnkopf (1991: 280) or
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">Jander and Lutz (1991)</xref>
        argue? Obviously, it is difficult at
this stage to make clear judgements about this development, so that statements
inevitably remain vague, e.g. Ermischer and Preusche's (1995: 60) conclusion that
their case studies in 1994 show „more conflictual relations without the loss of
cooperation“. In addition, the discussion on „co-management or conflict“ seems to be
burdened with the problem that the authors seem to have different understandings of
what they mean by these terms, and that the concepts themselves are difficult to
operationalize.

      <title>Effective Works Councils?</title>
      <p>
        Related to the question of co-operation is whether works councils manage to
represent workers' interests effectively or not. However, there is little West German
research evaluating the quality of workplace relations and, in particular, examining
the interrelation between the two actors in terms of effective interest representation.
The only major study which focuses on the quality of interest representation is
Kotthoff's longitudinal case study analysis of 64 companies (1981; 1994),6 which
created a useful typology of works councils and distinguished between: (i) deficient
forms of interest representation: „the ignored works council“; „the isolated works
council“; „the works council as an extended arm of management“; and (ii) effective
forms of (autonomous) interest representation: „the respected, co-operative works
council“; „the respected, steadfast works council“; and „the works council as a
cooperative hostile power“. There is no corresponding East German research on this
issue, which is partly explained by the fact that it is especially hard to measure the
effectiveness of interest representation during times of transformation. The most
common approach in the current East German literature is to outline some problems
which works councils are currently facing and to assert (rather than to analyse) that
these problems hinder the proper functioning of works councils. There are at least
five problems mentioned in the literature (more by the Berlin/Göttingen group, e.g.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref34">Kädtler and Kottwitz (1993</xref>
        ; 1994), than by WISOC) and it is difficult to disentangle
them: (i) the intensified classical dilemma facing works councils of balancing the
interests of the company and the workforce in the devastating economic situation of
East Germany
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">(e.g. Kottwitz 1991: 417)</xref>
        ; (ii) the unsuitability of the West German
industrial relations system in the East German context (one frequently given reason for
which is the absence of prosperous companies which are said to be a precondition for
the successful functioning of the German industrial relations system)
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16 ref25 ref26 ref38">(e.g. Gut et al.
1993; Kädtler and Kottwitz 1994: 19, 1992: 3; Mahnkopf 1992)</xref>
        ; (iii) problems due to
the newness of the institution, for example the fact that works councils lack tacit skills
which are seen as necessary for the effective articulation and representation of interests
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23 ref37">(e.g. Jander and Lutz 1993; Mahnkopf 1991: 275)</xref>
        ; (iv) the problematic union-works
council relationship (rising „plant-egoism“ of works councils vs. collective interests of

the unions)
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35 ref37 ref39 ref44">(e.g. Lippold et al. 1992; Mahnkopf 1991: 282, 1993: 17)</xref>
        ; and (v) the
supposedly low image of the works council among the workforce, i.e. workers perceive
works councils as ineffective
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21 ref44">(e.g. Jander et al. 1992)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref34">Kädtler and Kottwitz (1993</xref>
        : 4) go so far as to suggest that these deficiencies in
workplace relations have implications for the functioning of the whole industrial
relations system. According to
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">Jander and Lutz (1993)</xref>
        there is the paradox that
although the West German industrial relations system was transferred without any
adjustments to the particular East German situation, East Germany could very well
end up not practising the same industrial relations as the West, especially because of
the ineffective works councils
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(see also Jacoby 1994)</xref>
        . For these researchers therefore
the likely scenario is of a few companies with „good“ workplace relations surrounded
by a majority of companies with poor co-determination practices
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">(see also Mahnkopf
1991)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        However, listing possible reasons why works councils might not be effective is
not an entirely satisfactory exercise. The authors do not provide persuasive evidence as
to why these problems render works councils ineffective, nor do they analyse whether
these supposed problems are short-term (due to the novelty of the institutions) or
longterm (due to the structural unsuitability of western regulations in the East).
Furthermore, it has also not been tested how far these problems, rather than, for
example, unco-operative management, account for any works council ineffectiveness.
There are also problems with the arguments as such. To give just one example: arguing
that the West German system is not suitable for the specific East German situation does
not provide a convincing explanation why this should evoke a dysfunctioning of the
works council. Without wanting to go into the debate as to how far the situation in the
East today is comparable with that of West Germany after 1945
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">(see Jacoby 1994)</xref>
        , it
seems a dubious assertion that the West German industrial relations system only
„works“ in prosperous economic situations. The system seems to have managed
various recessions during the last few decades in West Germany.
      </p>
      <p>As said before most of the studies are based solely on interviews with
councillors (and sometimes with management). Very few came from more
comprehensive case studies and none includes workers' attitudes and behaviour
towards the new institutions. This study attempts to contribute to the analysis of the
quality of workplace relations in East German firms in two ways. Co-operative
workplace relations will be investigated by focusing on one side, works councillors'
attitudes towards management, only. Moreover, the study examines the „customers“
of works councils, the workforce, and analyse their perceptions of the works council's
effectiveness.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-4">
      <title>Method</title>
      <p>The study comprised two surveys, one of works councillors and one of
unionized workers in selected textile companies in East Germany. The purpose was to
apply a quantitative method to the investigation of the workplace relations from a
works councillors' and workers' point of view in a larger sample of workplaces
(compared to the research reviewed).7</p>
      <p>
        The textile industry was and still is (similar to other manufacturing industries)
severely affected by Unification and the subsequent exposure to the world market
which led to a dramatic reduction in employment8 (e.g.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24 ref34">Küchle and Volkmann 1993</xref>
        ).
It was mainly selected because the textile industry is a sector which has not been
looked at in the research of transformation and is largely neglected in the general
industrial relations studies in Germany.
      </p>
      <p>The two surveys9 were carried out in 1994 in textile firms across the bargaining
region of the South East branch of the German textile union, GTB (Gewerkschaft für
Textil und Bekleidung). The union branch covers the largest part of East Germany
and includes the traditional textile cities in Saxony. At the time of the study (Summer
1994) this union area comprised 385 textile and clothing firms with 28,070
employees, of which 14,425 were union members. This results in a union density of
48.2% (GTB Information 1994).</p>
      <p>
        The works councillor questionnaire was distributed to works councils of that
district and was returned by 53 works councils.10 The questionnaire consisted of two
parts, one dealing with background information of the extent of transformation which
occurred in the firm, the other dealing with a set of Likert-scale attitudinal questions
on the workplace climate. These were adopted from
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">Dastmalchian et al. (1991)</xref>
        ,

        and
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">Allen and Stephenson (1983)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>The union membership questionnaire was conducted in the above surveyed 53
textile firms in 1994 and comprised altogether 73 questions on various issues of the
transformation of the workplaces. The questionnaire was distributed through the union
machinery and works councils to union members. 440 completed questionnaires were
returned, which gives a response rate of approximately 40%. All questions were
answered on 5-point Likert scales. A selection of the items which deal with workers'
perception of the works council and workers' willingness to actively support the works
council is presented in the table of the results section. Workers' willingness to become
active is used as an additional, more indirect measure of people's views of the
instrumentality of works councils. A certain amount of trust in the institutions'
effectiveness is assumed to be necessary for people to engage in works councils'

        The return rate is not known, since it was beyond the author's control to monitor the number
of firms which received the questionnaire. In the most unlikely case that all unionized works
councils in the district (148) had received a questionnaire, the rate would be 35,8%. The
questionnaire was to be filled out by one full-time councillor, not necessarily the chief
councillor. The questionnaire consists of 29 questions altogether.

        <title>5.1 Background Company Information of the Works Councillor Survey</title>
        <p>Four topics were discussed, organisational changes (ownership, management,
staff reductions, technology), workforce characteristics (male/female ratio), union
membership (density), and incidents of industrial conflict. Most firms had been
privatised (only 7 were still owned by the Treuhand) and belonged to West German
or foreign companies or via MBO to management. Changes in management had
occurred in most sites, yet there was a mixed picture regarding old/new managers. 22
(out of 53) firms had either kept all or most former managers and 30 firms kept no or
only very few former managers. At the supervisory level nothing really had changed,
with 41 firms having kept the former supervisors. T-tests11 revealed no significant
differences between private and state ownership with regard to changes at
supervisory level and changes in management. Thus, privately owned firms had not
necessarily more „new“ supervisors and managers than Treuhand firms.</p>
        <p>
          With regard to staff reductions, most firms had reduced their staff by at least
50%,12 which was not uncommon in other industries
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">(e.g. Nolte and Sitte 1995)</xref>
          . With
regard to the medium-term prospects of their firms, the respondents were split: 22 were
sceptical and 20 were more optimistic. Privately owned firms were more optimistic
than Treuhand firms, and firms with new management felt more secure than those with
former managers staying.13 A majority of firms had invested in new machinery and
restructured the production process. Most works councillors perceived the work pace
on the shopfloor to have increased enormously from 1989. With regard to the
workforce, in only three firms was the female rate less than 50% of the total workforce,
and in 16 it was higher than 90%. This confirms the female dominance in the textile
workforce. Union density was still high: in 11 firms it was over 80% and in 20 between
30 and 79% (which is roughly in line with the union density of the district: 48,2%).
Ttests revealed that the density was stronger in firms with former managers and in more
unsecure firms, but not necessarily stronger in Treuhand firms compared to private
ones. There were only three incidences of industrial unrest so far, which supports the
idea of the textile industry as a non-militant sector, and the larger the female share in
the workforce the lower was the likelihood of industrial unrest. Finally, with regard to
the responding works councillors, over half have had been in position since 1990/91.
        </p>
        <p>T-tests are available from the author.</p>
        <p>In 1989 half of the firms employed between 200 and 1000 employees, in 1994 most of them
employed less than 100 employees.</p>
        <p>
          This was confirmed by t-tests.
16 had been active members of the former socialist union branch (BGL =
„Betriebsgewerkschaftsleitung“), and 34
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">had not. Thus, Martens' (1992</xref>
          ) suggestion that
old unionists are in a majority in East German works councils could not be supported
here. Furthermore, although this was not explicitly controlled for, one can assume that
all respondents were union members (since the GTB only distributed questionnaires to
unionised works councils14).

        <title>Workplace Climate from the Viewpoint of the Works Councillors</title>
        <p>The idea was to apply a set of previously tested questions here in order to
examine the quality of workplace relations (i.e. workplace climate) from the works
councillors' viewpoint. It is obvious that this cannot provide a complete picture of the
workplace situation. In addition, this small-scale survey is not able to establish
various types of works councils such as Kotthoff's detailed categorisation. However,
it might be a first approach to investigate the two opposite hypotheses of the
literature, works council as „co-manager“ or as a powerless „extended arm of
management“ in a relatively large sample of one industrial sector. The first eight
items of table 1 define the quality of the management–works council relations,
whereas the remaining questions explore broader related topics.</p>
        <p>Three quarters of the respondents agreed on most issues, and there were virtually
no missing answers. The first eight items were put into factor analysis and revealed
two factors. The first factor (items 1.-4.) is concerned with the practice of
management–works council relations, whereas the second factor (items 6.-8.)
describes councillors' more general views on management.15</p>
        <p>Absolute level of items of works council-management relations (N= sample size)</p>
        <p>Which means that at least the chief councillor is a union member.</p>
        <p>Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure = 0,6685; cumulated pct of variance = 65,6; factor 1 (items
1.,2.,3.,4.): eigenvalue = 1,36214 (pct of variance = 17,0); alpha = 0,677 (standardized alpha
= 0,679); factor 2 (items 6.,7.,8.): eigenvalue = 2,70014 (pct of variance = 33,8); alpha =
0,598 (standardized alpha = 0,598).</p>
        <p>With regard to the first factor, the workplace relationship was typically
perceived as harmonious, the councillors were willing to do their part, and problems
were often solved informally. On the other hand, councillors felt insufficiently
involved in strategic planning and insufficiently informed. These might be seen as
„standard“ complaints of councillors and one might conclude that in overall the
positive perception of the general relationship succeeds.</p>
        <p>
          There were significant correlations16 between whether the general relationship
was perceived as positive and the number of former directors employed in this
company (r= .29*) and whether the councillor was a former BGL official (r= .27*):
Works councillors in a company with no former directors were more likely to
perceive the relationship as „good“ as in companies with former directors, and works
councillors who were not former BGL officials were more likely to perceive the
relationship as good than works councillors who were former BGL officials. This was
also confirmed by t-tests. Thus, contrary to some suggestions in the literature
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(e.g.
Ermischer and Preusche 1992)</xref>
          it may be that the old networks between directors and
        </p>
        <p>Significance level: * = p&lt;= 0,05, ** = p&lt;= 0,01
union officials are more obstructive than helpful in creating co-operative workplace
relations in the privatised firms.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the general perception of the workplace relations is correlated with
the following questions: the more works councils were involved in strategic planning
(r= .35*) or feel sufficiently informed (r= -.38**), the more they perceived a positive
relationship with management and the less likely they described management as
strengthening its power. Moreover, companies which had not experienced industrial
conflicts were more likely to have this harmonious relationship (r= .35*).
Furthermore, t-tests found that the more insecure the future of the firm, the more the
works council saw the need for harmonious relationships (in the best interest of the
workforce). This is a very interesting finding. At first sight one might interpret good
relationships with management as coming out of a weak bargaining position of the
works council. However, it seems more likely that it means that difficult times bind
the two sides together.</p>
        <p>
          Finally, t-tests revealed that companies with former managers were more likely
to have informal negotiations. This might indicate a legacy of former socialist
workplace relations in firms with predominantly former managerial staff, as has been
suggested in previous studies
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">(e.g. Ermischer and Preusche 1993)</xref>
          . Obviously it is
difficult to evaluate at this stage whether this is a temporary or a permanent
phenomenon.
        </p>
        <p>With regard to the second factor („general views of management“) the overall
result is less positive. Management was perceived untrustful and as trying to
strengthen its power (t-tests revealed that this is more perceived in financially
„secure“ than in „insecure“ firms). In addition, the councillors acknowledged the
conflicting interests of employers and unions. If management was perceived to be
seeking to strengthen its power, works councils were also more likely to perceive
union–employer relations as antagonistic (r= .31*). However, t-tests did not reveal a
significant difference between private and state ownership with regard to perceptions
of different interests.</p>
        <p>In sum, it seems that although the works councillors were convinced of the
desirability of harmonious relations, and were willing to do its part, they realised that
management was sometimes less willing to co-operate, and they perceived a
difference of interests of both sides.</p>
        <p>
          Regarding the second part of the questionnaire, works councils were described
primarily as connecting links between management and workforce, thus not as a pure
interest representation, and consequently the well-being of the company was seen as
of prime importance. This is also a typical phenomenon in West German studies
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">(e.g.
Kotthoff 1994)</xref>
          and in line with the legislative objectives (Betriebsverfassungsgesetz).
The data also adds support to the argument in the literature that „plant-level
egoism“17 predominates East German works councils
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35 ref37 ref44">(e.g. Lippold et al. 1992;
Mahnkopf 1991: 282; 1993: 17)</xref>
          .
        </p>
        <p>Furthermore, management was seen as pursuing a trustworthy relationship with
the workforce, which correlated with the general perception of good workplace
relations (r= .68**) and with works councils being described as a connecting link
between management and workforce (r= .32*). Interestingly, the higher the share of
females in the workforce, the more management was perceived as fostering a trustful
relation with the workforce (r= .50**), and the works councils as a connecting link
(r= .31*). However there was no significant difference between private and state
owned firms with regard to management's relationship to the workforce.</p>
        <p>Finally, the workforce was perceived as supporting the works council, especially
in firms employing few former directors. Thus, the councillors argued that workplace
relations are generally better in firms with new management than with the old
directors. Yet, the workforce is said to support the works council more in firms with
new management. One could follow that the works council saw privatisation and new
management as favourable conditions, whereas the workforce might have more
themand-us feelings towards the new management (and therefore supports their interest
representation stronger).

        <title>Union Members' Perceptions of Works Councils</title>
        <p>The sample of the unionised workforce18 contained 70% females, 25% present

formerly active union members, and 75% blue collar workers. The sample slightly

        <p>The overall importance of works councils was widely acknowledged. The
comparison between the BGL (former socialist union branch at shopfloor level) and
the works council received more divided answers, but still more than a half preferred
the works council. With regard to members' perception of works council effectiveness
in dealing with specific workplace issues, the results were nearly equally split in
positive and negative perceptions, but with slightly more emphasis on the negative
side. However, one should note that people were not being asked here their overall
views on being represented by their works council. There were no significant

activities (i.e. activities organised by the works council) such as attending the works
council assemblies, but less willingness to become active in more time consuming,
„self-initiated“ activities (i.e. activities where people deliberately take the initiative to

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>
        The findings of the works councillor questionnaire contribute to two
propositions of the literature reviewed. Firstly, they cannot support the widespread
claim of researchers that workplace relations were more antagonistic or that the
works council was pushed to the sidelines after privatisation. Clearly, this data is a
„snap shot“, not longitudinal and thus does not provide information on possible
changes before and after privatisation. Furthermore, the small sample and the limited
number of questions do not allow a final judgement on the quality of works
councilmanagement relations. However, the data gives a first indication that the current
relationship in these firms, which are mostly privatised, was generally harmonious.
Thus, the data adds support to the argument of „co-management“ by the WISOC
group
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(e.g. Ermischer and Preusche 1992)</xref>
        . Moreover, it challenges the argument that
co-management is at risk in firms after privatisation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(e.g. Ermischer and Preusche
1995: 59)</xref>
        , and that privatisation is likely to cause a polarisation between the two
sides
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">(e.g. Kern and Land 1991)</xref>
        . In contrast, the data revealed that co-operation was
more likely where there were „new“ managers and „new“ works councillors. A rather
straightforward interpretation for this perhaps surprising finding is that the old
relations between directors and worker representatives were highly distrustful and
conflictual and privatisation enabled „fresh blood“ to make a new start. This assumes
that both sides perceive co-operative relations as worthwhile (the councillors
acknowledged this).
      </p>
      <p>Secondly, the findings oppose the fears of some researchers (especially the
Berlin/Göttingen group) that works councils are powerless „extended arms of
management“. Although the councillors in this sample are obviously not „conflictual,
class conscious works councils“ and strongly antagonistic (see Kotthoff's typology
above), they are very aware of the different interests of capital and labour and also of
the power balance within the firm and do not necessarily trust management. Thus,
they surely do not represent Kotthoff's „deficient“ types of works councils (isolated,
ignored, extended arm of management), but more his „effective“ types, in particular
the „respected, co- operative“ works council. In other words, the data supports more
the hypothesis of co-operative relationships than that of a one-sided acquiescence on
the part of the works councils. However, the survey certainly does not allow any final
conclusion regarding the practical effectiveness of the works councils' interest
representation, and therefore the categorisation can be only speculative. The real
effectiveness of these councils is better to be explored by methods such as
nonparticipative observation or interviews with the workforce or by the workforce
questionnaires. However, the finding that the works councils felt strongly supported
by the workforce might be a first indicator of the works councils' functioning and
indeed its effectiveness.</p>
      <p>With regard to the membership questionnaire the three major findings are firstly
the overall acceptance of the works council as a necessary institution, and a clear
preference for the new interest institution. This also confirms the preliminary
suggestion in the works council questionnaire, that works councils saw themselves
being accepted by their workforce.</p>
      <p>
        The second major result refers to the divided views on the works council's actual
work. One needs to address how this finding relates to the hypothesis in the literature
that workers are highly disillusioned over the effectiveness of works councils (with
respect to the redundancies, co-management etc.). Workers were realistic about the
limited resources of works councils in these economic circumstances. This might be
disappointing, yet it did not lead people to reject the institution as such. In short,
although the findings do not suggest highly effective and powerful institutions,
workers conclude that this is related more to the external conditions than to the design
of the institution as such. One should add that this result might be biased by the fact
that only union members were asked. However, this survey was also distributed to
non-union members in the largest firm of our sample and the results for this firm did
not reveal any significant differences between non-union members and members in
this respect
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref15">(see Frege 1996a, chp. 9)</xref>
        . In sum, the data adds support to the more
positive studies about workers' attitudes towards the works council, such as
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">Heering
and Schroeder (1992)</xref>
        who found that 76% of their sample had a positive attitude
towards their works council (the precise question is however not published); and
challenges pessimistic studies suc

        ). Moreover, the large-scale

the German working population (employed and unemployed) every ot
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">her year (since
1992</xref>
        in the East and West), on their attitudes towards interest institutions, shows that
a majority of East German employees value the works councils' work in 1994 slig
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">htly
more than in 1992</xref>
        , although they were still more critical than in the West: in 1994
32% of East Germans valued the work (46% West Germans), 30% marked it
negatively (25%). In particular, our data is more positive than the DGB results for the
GTB (West and East): T
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">hese were in 1992</xref>
        considerably below the DGB German
average with only 6% approving the works council's work (no separate data for
1994). However 59% did not answer and the sample consisted of only 83 persons,
which questions the data's reliability.21
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the third result refers to members' strong willingness to participate in
certain works council activities and their conviction that workers' support is a
necessary condition for works councils' effectiveness. This underlines workers'
acceptance of the new institution and a conviction of its basic instrumentality.
Besides, the data supports an established western theory that members are far easier
to mobilize for selective collective actions than for continuous voluntary
commitments. A similar distinction has also been found in the questions on union
participation
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14 ref15">(see Frege 1996b)</xref>
        and also in West German studies. For example,

      <title>Conclusion</title>
      <p>Neither survey can provide the in-depth analysis of workplace relations that
intensive case studies can provide. On the other hand it is rare to see relatively large
samples of works councils and unionized workers being examined together, and this
in an industrial sector which is normally neglected in such an area of research.</p>
      <p>In a nutshell the works councillor data presented co-operative attitudes towards
management, in particular in firms with „new“ managers and „new“ councillors.
However, the councillors were cautious in trusting management and critical about
management's willingness to co-operate. They also did not perceive themselves as
extended arms of management. Overall, it seems safe to say that co-operation might
well be founded on the new transferred industrial relations institutions rather than
being a legacy of the socialist times.</p>
      <p>
        Moreover, works councillors did not seem to neglect their representative tasks,
as has been proposed in various studies
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22 ref26">(e.g. Jander and Lutz 1991; Kädtler and
Kottwitz 1994)</xref>
        . This is supported by the worker survey. The data reveals that,
although successes were critically evaluated, workers were aware of the desperate
economic situation limiting works council's possibilities. Thus the limited
effectiveness of works councils did not prejudice people's acceptance, legitimisation
and support of the new institutions
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21 ref44">(contrary to Jander et al. 1992)</xref>
        . The works
councils were widely accepted as a necessary and important interest institution at
workplace level.
      </p>
      <p>
        In sum, both data sets support Kotthoff's category of an effective, respected and
co-operative works council (which was also the major category in his West German
study). This finding might stir up first doubts about the conclusion of some literature
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">(e.g. Mense-Petermann 1996)</xref>
        that qualitatively different workplace relations
becoming established in the East Germany (compared to the West). In addition, the
data also indicates a successful „institutionalisation“ of the works council. Thus, not
only were the works councils formally installed but also the „substantive“ or
„normative“ establishment was successful in terms of the acceptance, legitimisation
and support of the actors, i.e. workers, involved. This result stands in strong contrast
to that of studies which emphasize the lack of workers' support for works councils
and which postulate that the works councils have not yet been successfully
institutionalised
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23 ref35 ref37 ref44 ref47">(e.g. Jander and Lutz 1993; Mahnkopf 1991: 280 pp; Lippold et al.
1992: 92; Spangenberg 1993: 20)</xref>
        . Finally, this data provides a first indication that the
current problems of the East German works councils are far more likely to be caused
by structural factors (i.e. recession, restructuring of the industry) than by internal
factors (i.e. institutional deficiencies, lacking support of workforce) or indeed
management strategies.
