International Human Rights Law Aspects of Forced Migrations, Evictions and Displacement:</p>
      <p>Current Issues and Challenges
Paper Presented at the „New Trends in Regional Development” Conference, Siena, June 3rd
2016.</p>
      <p>Summary: The aim of this paper is an analysis of the categories of evictions, forced migrations and
internal displacement in the context of international human rights law. Forced migrations and
selected categories of internal displacement are important issues of international human rights law
and international humanitarian law for more than forty years. The UDHR, adopted in 1948, does not
contain any provisions related to forced human mobility and internal displacement. Despite this fact
we can mention many important international law regulations focused on citizenship and human
mobility. The growing interest of international community on the above-mentioned issues can be
dated back to the nineties of the last century. First in-depth studies focused on
environmentallyinduced displacement and development-induced displacement can be dated back to the seventies
and eighties of the last century. Since nineties we are observing the growing number of published
on these issues, inter alia by Michael M. Cernea, Bogumil Terminski, Thayer Scudder, Etienne
Piguet and many others. The issues of forced migrations, evictions and internal displacement are
currently very important areas of international cooperation. Presented articles is focused on global
estimations concerning the scale and dynamics of these categories (part 1), international
cooperation and its international human rights law aspects (part 2) and the socio-legal consequences
of forced migrations, evictions and internal displacement.</p>
      <p>Resume: Le but de cet article est une analyse des catégories d'expulsions, les migrations forcées et
les déplacements internes dans le cadre du droit international des droits humains. catégories forcées
migrations et sélectionnées de déplacement interne sont des questions importantes du droit
international des droits de l'homme et du droit international humanitaire depuis plus de quarante
ans. La DUDH, adoptée en 1948, ne contient pas de dispositions relatives à la mobilité humaine
forcée et le déplacement interne. En dépit de ce fait, nous pouvons citer de nombreux règlements du
droit international importantes axées sur la citoyenneté et la mobilité humaine. L'intérêt croissant de
la communauté internationale sur les questions mentionnées ci-dessus peut être datée des années
nonante du siècle dernier. Tout d'abord des études approfondies ont porté sur les déplacements
provoqués par l'environnement et le déplacement induit par le développement peuvent être
remontent aux années soixante-dix et quatre-vingt du siècle dernier. Depuis des années nonante,
nous observons le nombre croissant de publié sur ces questions, entre autres, par Michael M.
Cernea, Bogumil Terminski, Thayer Scudder, Etienne Piguet et beaucoup d'autres. Les questions de
migrations forcées, les expulsions et les déplacements internes sont actuellement des domaines très
importants de la coopération internationale. Les articles présentés sont axés sur des estimations
globales concernant l'ampleur et la dynamique de ces catégories (partie 1), la coopération
internationale et de ses droits de l'homme aspects de droit international (partie 2) et les
conséquences socio-juridiques des migrations forcées, les expulsions et les déplacements internes.</p>
      <p>Global Trends in Forced Migrations, Evictions and Internal Displacement:
Internal displacement: While the above stresses two important elements of internal displacement
(coercion and the domestic/internal movement), it is important to note that, rather than a strict
definition, the Guiding Principles offer "a descriptive identification of the category of persons
whose needs are the concern of the Guiding Principles". In this way, the document "intentionally
steers toward flexibility rather than legal precision" as the words "in particular" indicate that the list
of reasons for displacement is not exhaustive. However, as Erin Mooney has pointed out, "global
statistics on internal displacement generally count only IDPs uprooted by conflict and human rights
violations. Moreover, a recent study has recommended that the IDP concept should be defined even
more narrowly, to be limited to persons displaced by violence." Thus, despite the non-exhaustive
reasons of internal displacement, many consider IDPs as those who would be defined as refugees if
they were to cross an international border, hence, the term refugees in all but name is often applied
to IDPs. It is very difficult to get accurate figures for IDPs because populations aren't constant. IDPs
may be returning home while others are fleeing, others may periodically return to IDP camps to take
advantage of humanitarian aid. While the case of IDPs in large camps such as those in Darfur,
western Sudan, are relatively well-reported, it is very difficult to assess those IDPs who flee to
larger towns and cities. It is necessary in many instances to supplement official figures with
additional information obtained from operational humanitarian organizations on the ground. Thus,
the 24.5 million figure must be treated as an estimate. Additionally, most official figures only
include those displaced by conflict or natural disasters. Development-induced IDPs often are not
included in assessments.</p>
      <p>So-called cluster approach constitute an important area of migration studies and research on
internal displacement. The cluster approach designates individual agencies as ‘sector leaders’ to
coordinate operations in specific areas to try to plug those newly identified gaps. The cluster
approach was conceived amid concerns about coordination and capacity that arose from the weak
operational response to the crisis in Darfur in 2004 and 2005, and the critical findings of the
Humanitarian Response Review (HRR) commissioned by the then ERC, Jan Egeland. Egeland
called for strengthening leadership of the sectors, and introduced the concept of "clusters" at
different levels (headquarters, regional, country and operational)’. Unlike the case of refugees, there
is no international treaty which applies specifically to IDPs. Some have advocated re-thinking the
definitions and protections for refugees to apply to IDPs, but so far no solid actions have come to
fruition.IASC Principles deemed it unnecessary to apply the cluster approach to four sectors where
no significant gaps were detected: a) food, led by WFP; b) refugees, led by UNHCR; c) education,
led by UNICEF; and d) agriculture, led by FAO. The original nine clusters were later expanded to
include agriculture and education.</p>
      <p>The cluster approach operates on the global and local levels. At the global level, the
approach is meant to build up capacity in eleven key ‘gap’ areas by developing better surge
capacity, ensuring consistent access to appropriately trained technical expertise and enhanced
material stockpiles, and securing the increased engagement of all relevant humanitarian partners. At
the field level, the cluster approach strengthens the coordination and response capacity by
mobilizing clusters of humanitarian agencies (UN/Red Cross-Red Crescent/IOs/NGOs) to respond
in particular sectors or areas of activity, each cluster having a clearly designated and accountable
lead, as agreed by the HC and the Country Team. Designated lead agencies at the global level both
participate directly in operations, but also coordinate with and oversee other organizations within
their specific spheres, reporting the results up through a designated chain of command to the ERC at
the summit. However, lead agencies are responsible as ‘providers of last resort’, which represents
the commitment of cluster leads to do their utmost to ensure an adequate and appropriate response
in their respective areas of responsibility. The cluster approach was part of a package of reforms
accepted by the IASC in December 2005 and subsequently applied in eight chronic humanitarian
crises and six sudden-onset emergencies. However, the reform was originally rolled out and
evaluated in four countries: DRC, Liberia, Somalia and Uganda.</p>
      <p>Prevention of forced migrations is another important area of international human rights law.
Forced migration has accompanied persecution, as well as war, throughout human history but has
only become a topic of serious study and discussion relatively recently. This increased attention is
the result of greater ease of travel, allowing displaced persons to flee to nations far removed from
their homes, the creation of an international legal structure of human rights, and the realizations that
the destabilizing effects of forced migration, especially in parts of Africa, the Middle East, south
and central Asia, ripple out well beyond the immediate region. Development-induced displacement
can be understood as a subset of forced migration. Such displacement is the forcing of communities
and individuals out of their homes, often also their homelands, for the purposes of economic
development, conservation of nature, dams, urbanization, re-urbanization and population
redistribution schemes.</p>
      <p>Though the procedures for evictions differ depending on the specific laws of various
jurisdictions, the general process consists of 1) giving notice to the tenant (and any other person
residing there as well) to take prompt action to either correct the problem or otherwise leave the
premises (or, in some cases, unconditionally leave the premises), 2) if the tenant fails to leave the
premises, filing a lawsuit to evict the tenant and regain possession of the property (along with
amounts owed for damages, unpaid rent, and/or court costs and attorney's fees) and appearing in
court, and 3) if the tenant still remains in the premises, forcibly removing the tenant from them via
legal action. Most jurisdictions do not permit the landlord to evict a tenant without first taking legal
action to do so (commonly referred to as a "self-help" eviction; such actions include changing locks,
removing items from the premises, or terminating utility services). Such evictions are generally
illegal at any time during the process (including after a landlord wins an eviction suit); a tenant
facing such measures may sue the landlord. However, self-help evictions may be permitted in some
jurisdictions when commercial tenants are involved, as opposed to residential tenants.</p>
      <p>Prior to filing a suit in court for eviction, generally the landlord must provide written notice
to the tenant (commonly called a notice to quit or notice to vacate). A landlord may evict a tenant
"without cause" (i.e., the landlord simply desires to end the landlord-tenant relationship without the
tenant being in breach of the lease, such as when a lease is about to expire) or "for cause" (i.e., the
tenant is in breach of the lease, such as non-payment of rent or allowing criminal activity to take
place on the premises). The notice to vacate may either be conditional (i.e., the tenant may remain
in the premises if certain actions are taken prior to the specified date, such as payment of rent and
late fees due; this is sometimes known as cure or quit) or unconditional (i.e., the tenant can not do
anything to avoid the eviction and must leave by a specified date, an example would be due to a
tenant engaged in criminal activity). If the termination is without cause, the tenant is generally
given a longer period of time (generally 30 days) to vacate than if the termination is for cause, in
which case the tenant may have a short amount of time (perhaps as few as three days) in which to
correct the violation. In some jurisdictions, landlords may not be able to terminate a lease without
cause (such as in rent control jurisdictions). Where the law permits, a landlord and tenant may agree
to a different period of time for notice requirements than specified in the law.</p>
      <p>The issue of land-grabbing is another important category of evictions and displacements
worldwide. The issue of agricultural development is a significant driving factor, within the larger
umbrella of development, in target governments' agreement to investment by outsiders. The
Ethiopian government's acceptance of cash crop-based land acquisitions reflects its belief that
switching to cash crop production would be even more beneficial for food security than having
local farmers produce crops by themselves. Implicit in the characterization of African agriculture as
"underdeveloped" is the rejection of local communities' traditional methods of harvesting as an
inadequate form of food production. Foreign investors, through large-scale agriculture, increase the
effectiveness of underused resources of land, labor, and water, while further providing additional
market connections, large-scale infrastructure development, and provision of seeds, fertilizers, and
technology. Proposed increases in production quantity, as touted by investors and hosts, are
exemplified by Ethiopia’s Abera Deressa, who claims that “foreign investors should help boost
agricultural output by as much as 40%” throughout Ethiopia. In a joint research project between the
FAO, IIED, and IFAD, Cotula et al. found that the majority of host countries lacked basic data on
the size, nature, and location of land acquisitions through land registries or other public sources, and
that “researchers needed to make multiple contacts…to access even superficial and incomplete
information.”. The World Bank’s own lack of land size information on over half of the reported land
grabs that it researched points to the difficulties inherent in gaining access to and researching
individual land acquisitions. We can also mention some notable cases of land grabbing as a specific
category of internal displacement. In Madagascar, the anger among the population about land sales
led to violent protests. The South Korean corporation Daewoo was in the process of negotiations
with the Malagasy government for the purchase of 1.3 million hectares, half of all agricultural land,
to produce corn and palm oil. This investment, while one of many pursued in Madagascar, attracted
considerable attention there and led to protests against the government. In South Sudan, numerous
large-scale land acquisitions have taken place in spite of the country's unresolved political and
security situation. One of the most prominent, involving a former AIG partner named Philippe
Heilberg, garnered attention in Rolling Stone for his provocative pursuit of land in conflict-ridden
regions. Heilberg, who is planning to invest in 800,000 ha of land in partnership with many of
South Sudan's top generals and civilian officials, attracted criticism with his remarks (regarding
Africa and land grabbing) that "the whole place is like one big mafia — and I'm like a mafia head."</p>
      <p>Development-induced displacement and resettlement (DIDR) is the forcing of communities
and individuals out of their homes, often also their homelands, for the purposes of economic
development. According to Bogumil Terminski (2012) approximately fifteen million people each
year are forced to leave their homes following big development projects (dams, irrigation projects,
highways, urbanization, mining, conservation of nature, etc.). Anthony Oliver-Smith (2009) and
Michael M. Cernea (2006) are also estimating that current scale of DIDR amounts to 15 million
people per year. An increase in alcoholism due to displacement has led to a marked rise in domestic
violence in India. In the Lincoln Park Community of Chicago, Illinois, where Jose (Cha-Cha)
Jimenez founded the human rights Latino organization: Young Lords, Mayor Richard J. Daley
displaced tens of thousands Puerto Ricans and the poor. This displacement helped to proliferate
growing street gangs. Today these gangs enterprises with murder for hire, arson for profit and drug
sales as its prime motivation. Displacement has made men feel helpless or insecure and turned
women and children into scapegoats. Displacement also leads to deterioration in health and high
mortality rates as services in those selected areas are the first to be cut. The nutrition and health of
women, which is worse than that of men even under normal circumstances, is bound to go down in
the event of an overall worsening in health caused by displacement. According to Michael M.
Cernea the main causes of development-induced displacement include: water supply (construction
of dams, artificial reservoirs, irrigation projects), urban infrastructure, transportation (roads,
highways, canals); energy (mining, power plants, oil exploration and extraction, pipelines),
expansion of agriculture, parks and forest reserves and population redistribution schemes.
According to Bogumil Terminski the principal causes of DIDR include: 1. the construction of dams,
hydroplants, and large irrigation projects, 2. the building of highways, roads and railroad networks,
3. urbanization and social services (expansion of cities, urban transport, water supply), 4. expansion
of agriculture (especially monoculture plantations), 5. mining (oil exploitation, gold, copper, coal
mining), 6. conservation of nature, 7. population redistribution schemes, 8. other causes.</p>
      <p>International Human Rights Law Aspects of Evictions, Forced Migrations and Internal</p>
      <p>Displacement</p>
      <p>Legal aspects of forced mobility, internal displacement and evictions is an issue
welldiscussed in existing scientific literature. Guiding Principles of Internal Displacement (1998) ant the
Kampala Convention (2009) are the only international instruments devoted to this issues he
Kampala Convention (formally, the African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of
Internally Displaced Persons in Africa) is a treaty of the AU that addresses internal displacement
caused by and large-scale development projects in Africa. The Convention was adopted in October
2009. As of 2015 it has been signed by 40 and ratified by 24 of the 54 member states of the African
Union. The Convention entered into force on 6 December 2012, 30 days after its ratification by the
15th state. Article 5(4) specifically establishes state responsibilities for the protection and assistance
of internally displaced persons, whose displacement is the result of "natural or human made
disasters, including cvlimate change. Centre of Housing Rights and Evictions (COHRE) is
important NGO actor in the field of evictions worldwide. COHRE’s work was based on the
assumption that the role of the affected communities is of crucial importance in addressing housing
rights violations. The poor themselves should be directly involved in formulating and implementing
solutions and alternatives. Communities have a vital contribution to make, without which most
housing-related projects simply will not succeed. In housing rights or eviction cases where COHRE
became directly involved, COHRE therefore strived to build alliances and partnerships and to
embark on joint campaigns with groups and support organisations working at community level.
Working at community level is often not sufficient in itself. As national, regional and international
action can be very effective in cases of major housing rights violations, COHRE also formed
partnerships with organisations working at these broader levels. Another tool is the collection of
relevant, accurate information. COHRE regularly sends multi-disciplinary fact-finding teams to key
focus countries. They typically conduct in-loco investigations, conduct interviews with the main
role players, study relevant laws, policies and programmes and do any additional research required
for an assessment of the nature and scope of land and housing rights violations in a particular
situation. This would provide the basis for drawing up recommendations and alternatives. These
missions are usually conducted at the request of, and in collaboration with, local partners. COHRE
used the draft fact-finding reports as tools for consultation and negotiations with key role-players,
including governments. This strategy has proven effective in convincing government to grapple
with the extent of the violations and the implications of proceeding with current policies and
practice. Once finalised, COHRE fact-finding reports are used as information resources for local
human rights organisations and the affected communities; for lobbying the relevant government to
introduce new policies, laws and programmes. Fact-finding reports are also useful tools at regional
and international level to place pressure on the relevant governments; and to form the basis of
shadow reports for submission before UN human rights mechanisms and other regional and
international bodies. COHRE promotes policy and legislative reform at national, regional and
international level, to ensure that housing rights and delivery frameworks and legal instruments are
improved where it is possible.</p>
