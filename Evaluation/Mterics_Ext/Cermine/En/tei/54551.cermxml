      <p>Presently, Zimbabwe is very much out of the news. The 2013 elections
have come and gone; the Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic
Front (ZANU-PF) has reasserted its hold on state power; the economy
is getting worse and worse; and the world continues to await the
displacement or death of the country’s nonagenarian president, Robert
Mugabe. In a word, it’s pretty much business as usual, except in so far as
the climaxing of competing tragedies in such countries as South Sudan
and Burundi now render Zimbabwe an African sideshow. True, there is
considerable interest in the intra–ZANU-PF power struggles around the
presidential succession, but generally the global perspective on
Zimbabwe is one of resignation. In essence, this contribution argues that
external interventions to change Zimbabwe’s course have been miserably
ineffective. Accordingly, a democratic solution to the country’s travails is
pretty much a non-starter, and the best that can be hoped for is a
nottoo-violent political transition to a post-Mugabe order. If Zimbabweans
want a democracy, they must be left to create it for themselves.</p>
      <p>The two books reviewed here throw much light on why this policy
position – which I take to be that of the Western and even some African
elites – has come about. They are very different books. David Coltart’s
volume uses autobiography to explore the bitter disappointments of
Zimbabwean history. In contrast, Michael Bratton’s book explains the
Zimbabwean impasse by drawing upon the literature on power sharing
and institutional change. They will almost certainly be able to engage
rather different audiences. Coltart’s account will have more popular
appeal, while Bratton’s will draw more academic attention. Furthermore,
whilst Coltart – sustained by his Christian faith – remains (perversely?)
optimistic about the future of Zimbabwe, Bratton’s realist approach is
considerably gloomier. Even so, despite their differences, these
contributions complement each other nicely. Both are consumed by key
questions: How can Zimbabwe grapple with its history and resolve its
apparently intractable conflicts? What prospect is there for some sort of
transitional justice? Is there any realistic chance of transitioning to
democracy? There is no originality in these questions. They are of concern to all
those who have an abiding interest in Zimbabwe. However, both books
add considerably to the richness of debate. After a brief review of their
content, I will discuss how they address these issues.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-2">
      <title>Bratton: The Dynamics of Power Politics</title>
      <p>Bratton “analyzes the resilience of authoritarian rule in Zimbabwe through
the lenses of power politics and elite political settlements” (10). By
capturing the state, leaders have been able to entrench lasting arrangements to
exercise power, never hesitating to use violence and defy the rule of law.
“Power politics” he borrows from the realist tradition of international
relations, “which views states as locked in blunt competition to achieve
self-defined national interests in the absence of overarching external
authority” (7), choosing to apply it to the domestic rather than the
international arena. While Thomas Hobbes might well protest that Mugabe’s
particular conceit is that he embodies the sovereign, Bratton eschews any
such emphasis upon a “big man,” providing an alternative emphasis on the
broader civilian–military elite coalition which surrounds the president
(235). So even when, at critical junctures, such sovereign elites feel
compelled by circumstance to enter into more inclusive pacts with rivals, they
do their best to undermine these pacts and to return to the status quo ante.</p>
      <p>Beyond his explanation of power politics, Bratton organises the
book into four parts. First, distinguishing between “power capture,”
“power sharing,” and “power division,” he provides overviews of the
different political settlements which have defined Zimbabwean politics.
The colonial political settlement, which favoured a small white minority,
went through different iterations: rule by the British South Africa
Company; settler rule under authority delegated from Westminster; settler
rebellion; and, finally, the Lancaster House independence settlement,
whereby Britain brokered a compromise between the settler regime and
African liberation movements, granting majority rule in return for
guarantees of property and economic continuity. However, under this
settlement (1980), ZANU-PF’s drive for exclusive power saw it waging
ethnocidal war against its internal rival, Joshua Nkomo’s Zimbabwe African
People’s Union (ZAPU), and violently cajoling the latter into collapsing
itself into the ruling party in 1987. Subsequently, in the wake of
escalating economic and political crises, ZANU-PF was to be bundled into a
power-sharing arrangement with a new rival, the Movement for
Democratic Change (MDC), in 2008. Bratton characterises these settlements as
“elite pacts” rather than “social contracts,” with elite interests
continuously predominating. All of them have been built upon “manipulation of
the law, economic exclusion, political intimidation, covert operations,
and […] physical violence” (7).</p>
      <p>In Part 2, Bratton goes beyond other accounts of the post-2008
period by placing the MDC–ZANU-PF coalition in a cross-national, African
context. Power sharing between rival elites was implemented relatively
successfully to end settler rule in South Africa and civil war in Sierra
Leone. However, it was far less successful in Kenya. Although it brought a
momentary halt to violence following the disputed presidential elections of
2007, it enabled a president (Kibaki) to retain power despite having
possibly lost the election. Indeed, the coalition period failed to address the
deep structural domination long enjoyed by the Kikuyu elite (118). Bratton
concludes that whereas in South Africa and Sierra Leone political
adversaries saw advantages in resolving differences by talking rather than
fighting, in Kenya, and as he goes on to detail, in Zimbabwe, power
sharing was used by incumbent elites to regroup and recapture the state.</p>
      <p>In Part 3, Bratton turns to fundamental reforms that he considers
necessary for countries to resolve intractable domestic conflicts. In the
Zimbabwean case, he refers to constitution making, election
management, security sector reform, and transitional justice. The first three of
these have already received considerable attention, there being wide
consensus that for Zimbabwe to make progress towards democracy, it
needs a fully inclusive constitutional settlement, it needs elections to be
independently managed, and it needs civilian control to be asserted over
the military. How to achieve these worthy ends is a more difficult matter,
and Bratton’s commentaries (for instance, that the best hope for
professionalisation of the military lies simply in the passing of the generation
which fought the liberation war) are as sensible as any. Most valuable,
however, is his discussion of the need and prospects for transitional
justice, to which I turn in more detail below.</p>
      <p>His concluding Part 4 attempts to reflect upon the implications of
the Zimbabwean case for theory about power sharing and institutional
change for policymakers, and not least, the Zimbabwean people. He had
the advantage of writing after the 2013 election, when although
ZANUPF undoubtedly engaged in its customary chicanery, it nonetheless won a
renewed mandate, despite popular awareness of its past oppressions. In
the 2013 election, Bratton suggests, many people voted for ZANU-PF
simply because they feared that its rejection would result in a renewal of
political violence and conflict (244). In turn, he holds out little hope that
leadership succession within the ruling party will lead to a more liberal
social compact. Until that time, “the people of Zimbabwe will likely opt
for social peace and stability, rather than transitional justice or even
democratic liberty” (245).</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-3">
      <title>Coltart: The Struggle against Tyranny</title>
      <p>Coltart’s volume is prefaced by an impressive number of endorsements by
the great and the good. The one I like the most was penned by David
Blair, chief foreign correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, who describes
Coltart’s book as “an extended love letter to Zimbabwe,” citing the
author’s introductory comments, where he writes of Zimbabwe’s
“mountains, rivers, savannah plains, teak forests, rich soils, abundant water,” and
so on, along with “some of the most literate, hardworking, and kindest
people on the planet.” Although he acknowledges that Zimbabwe’s history
has been tumultuous, he is nonetheless “more than ever enthralled by this
great nation.” What Zimbabwe needs, he argues, is democracy – “a new
birth of freedom in which government of the people, by the people, and
for the people is cherished” (xiv). This is obviously endearing stuff. Yet it
also embodies an acute contradiction: How did “the kindest people on the
planet” give rise to such a brutally authoritarian post-independence
regime? It is this contradiction that Coltart seeks to unravel, albeit in a
manner more personal and less analytical than Bratton.</p>
      <p>
        Coltart’s outline of Zimbabwe’s historical trajectory, tracing the
country’s movement from racial to liberation-movement
authoritarianism is not original in itself. It has been traced many times before.
However, what is original is the extensive detail and insider knowledge of
many events and processes. For a start, Coltart’s account is utterly
compelling, even for those already soaked in Zimbabwean history. In
particular, he has rendered a major service by providing details of
disappearances, arrests, incarcerations, cases of torture, persecutions, prosecutions
– and, too often, murders – of numerous victims of the regime. Such
evils are of course valuably aggregated by civil society organisations such
as Amnesty International, but Coltart refers to the individuals involved,
for many of whom he served as a lawyer. For the families of such victims
as much as the victims themselves, it is important to have their names
inscribed into history. Further, in telling these individual stories, Coltart
weaves a fascinating account of how a relatively small number of
individuals – lawyers, activists, pastors, liberal whites and Africans alike, and
so on – worked to expose and counter regime oppression. Lawyers will
be gratified that even in situations where the law, judges, and the courts
had been largely suborned by the state, legal processes could sometimes
result in unexpectedly favourable outcomes. They will be less impressed,
however, by the need for even distinguished lawyers like Coltart and
other opponents of the regime who defend individuals in the courts to
take extreme measures to preserve their personal safety, ranging from
the wearing of bulletproof jackets to the necessity of packed suitcases in
case of arrest, along with the importance of “safe houses” for the
protection of their families. This account joins others
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(e.g. Todd 2007)</xref>
        in
reminding us very forcibly of the immense courage it has taken to
oppose vicious repression in Zimbabwe. In Coltart’s case, he could easily
have emigrated – but rather than take the easy route out, he deliberately
gave up his British citizenship, thereby making it more difficult for the
regime to expel him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any attempt to summarise Coltart’s account would be foolhardy, so
I will simply focus upon three aspects of it which I feel are of particular
value. The first is that it contributes to the growing literature
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">(such as
Godwin 1996)</xref>
        on “white Rhodesia.” Coltart is searingly honest in his
account of how, as a politically callow youth, he opted to do his national
service rather than flee. Ian Smith’s government had decreed that, upon
turning 18, all boys should do their service immediately after school
(previously they had been allowed to attend university first). Despite the
strong reservations of his parents, who opposed Smith and wanted their
son to avoid the draft, Coltart took the view of the white majority that it
was cowardly not to defend the country in the face of a “communist”
threat. For Coltart, therefore, “national service was a necessary evil to
secure a smooth, gradual transition to majority rule rather than a
revolution” (53).
      </p>
      <p>Coltart signed up for the police for three years, and he describes his
involvement in anti-guerrilla activities in detail. Yet it was while he was
with the police that he began to change. As a totally inexperienced
officer, he found himself heavily dependent upon black subordinates, who
were more competent than he was. Over time, too, he was to become
increasingly disillusioned by the methods used to combat “terrorists,”
(although he equally deplored the brutalities of the other side).
Ultimately, this led to his leaving the police early and heading for
undergraduate studies in law at the University of Cape Town (UCT). There he
mixed initially with other conservative “Rhodies” before a Damascene
conversion to active (as opposed to nominal) Christianity and
community work in the Crossroads squatter camp, along with exposure to UCT
liberalism, brought about a transformation in his views. Following the
1980 election, Coltart committed to returning to a new, more inclusive
Zimbabwe. It was there, as a fully fledged lawyer, that he was to become
drawn into the networks of activists, including that of former prime
minister Garfield Todd and his daughter Judith, which emerged in
defence of human rights as the Mugabe regime cranked up its assaults
upon its opponents.</p>
      <p>Fast-forward to the early 2000s, and there is valuable material on
the early development of the MDC, which Coltart joined only after he
had been invited to become its secretary for legal affairs. Soon he was
heavily involved in both the MDC’s call for a “no” vote in the 2000
referendum on ZANU-PF’s proposed new constitution and the MDC’s
subsequent campaign in the 2000 elections, the latter conducted amidst a
reign of terror by ZANU-PF. Standing as the MDC candidate in his
home town of Bulawayo, Coltart was elected to parliament by a
sweeping majority. Overall, however, with many of its supporters (notably in
rural areas) subjected to extreme violence, the MDC was denied victory.
So it was that Coltart became caught up in the maelstrom of opposition
politics, much of it concerning how parliamentary, media, and legal
campaigning should relate to mass action. This was to involve him in all sorts
of legal tangles with ZANU-PF. It also brought him and the MDC up
against unwelcome regional realities, such as South Africa’s and the
SADC’s backing of the result of the 2005 election, in which once again
ZANU-PF had trashed virtually all of the SADC’s own electoral
guidelines. “History had come full circle. Just as the Nationalists had allowed
the RF to frustrate the democratic will of the people, the ANC was
doing the same for ZANU-PF” (419).</p>
      <p>Of particular interest is Coltart’s account of how the MDC began to
unravel into rival factions in the wake of that election. Increasingly, there
were youth members of the MDC who wanted to return fire with fire,
and were impatient that the party’s involvement in parliamentary
processes had changed nothing. While Coltart insisted that it was the MDC’s
commitment to non-violence which had consistently distinguished it
from ZANU-PF, party leader Morgan Tsvangirai was more equivocal.
Subsequently, latent tensions became overt when the party split around
whether to participate in the 2005 Senate elections (the Senate having
been arbitrarily reinvented after prior abolition in 1989). Despite
vigorous efforts by Coltart to broker a peace, the breach was confirmed in
January 2006, when the MDC broke into two factions, one (the majority)
led by Tsvangirai (MDC-T), the other by Gibson Sibanda, who was soon
replaced by Arthur Mutambara (MDC-M). Initially undecided on which
faction to join, Coltart’s mind was made up by revelations made to him
that MDC operatives were being trained in South Africa. Although it was
not clear whether the training was defensive or offensive, weapons were
clearly involved. Apart from his own personal commitment to
non-violence, he regarded this as likely to invite an even harder crackdown by
ZANU-PF on its opponents (440–441).</p>
      <p>The division of the MDC was to chronically weaken the opposition
starting in the 2008 parliamentary elections. Although together the two
MDCs won a majority (MDC-T [99] + MDC-M [10] v. ZANU-PF [97]),
the divide caused them to lose the Senate and denied them a larger
majority in the Assembly. Nor did it help them in the presidential election
when the MDC-M opted to back ZANU-PF rebel Simba Makoni (8.3
per cent) rather than Tsvangirai (47.9 per cent), this – if the official
results are to be believed (which actually they are not!) – depriving the
latter of an absolute majority over Mugabe, forcing him under the
electoral rules into a run-off election. Coltart confirms that security
personnel thereupon resorted to extreme levels of violence to keep Mugabe in
power, which ultimately forced Tsvangirai to pull out of the campaign to
protect the safety of his supporters (476–477).</p>
      <p>There is much detail provided about the formation of the
powersharing coalition, although little that is new. However, what is fascinating
is Coltart’s description of his time in office as the MDC-M’s nominee to
head the Ministry of Education. His account of how he managed to
restore the schools system to something resembling functionality has its
own interest, but for most, the real value will lie in his description of the
workings of the coalition. How ZANU-PF ministers were clearly in awe
of Mugabe; how senior civil servants undermined MDC ministers; how
too many MDC ministers became seduced by the spoils of office; and
how Coltart perceived distinctions between hardline ZANU-PF
ministers, who were cynically exploiting the Government of National Unity
(GNU), and “moderates” (led by Vice President Joice Mujuru), with
whom he could work. Ultimately, of course, this was to no avail, for as
the 2013 election was looming, it became clear that ZANU-PF was
intent on manipulating the electoral process – something it achieved with
resounding success.</p>
      <p>
        Two further points: First, Coltart’s account gives copious detail of
his continuous travels overseas, his easy access to high foreign quarters,
and the numerous linkages that existed between civil society
organisations and with foreign funders. Although this exposed ZANU-PF’s
opponents to accusations of imperialism, it speaks to the importance of
external support for civil society where political space is being closed
down. Second, a cruel criticism which may be made of Coltart is that he
paints himself as Tarzan in Africa. Let us concede that he is not
immodest! However, the more important point is that we need far more, not
fewer, memoirs by holders of high offices in Africa. Penning
autobiographies is the staple activity of retired politicians in the West. In Africa,
too few retire, and even fewer write, leaving gaping holes in African
history

      <title>Zimbabwean History: Have Opportunities</title>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-5">
      <title>Been Missed?</title>
      <p>There is a case for counter-factual history if it points to how, at critical
junctures, choices were made which altered a country’s long term
historical trajectory. In the case of Zimbabwe, these two books pose the
question of whether things might have been different had the liberal
openings under Garfield Todd in the 1950s not occurred and had the
coalition government after 2008 not been displaced.</p>
      <p>Coltart admits to Garfield Todd, prime minister from 1953 to 1958,
being one of his heroes. His vision had been one of “a moderate,
tolerant, and democratic Zimbabwe” (359). As prime minister he had
introduced major reforms aimed at improving the education of the black
majority and made progress towards extending political rights to blacks.
However, such moves lost him the confidence of his cabinet, and he was
forced out of office. Todd was “hardly a liberal in the Western sense,”
yet nonetheless, “he was also a visionary and a man way ahead of his
time” (13).</p>
      <p>There can be no quarrel with the view that Todd – who was to play
an honourable role in protesting human rights abuses under both Smith
and Mugabe – deserves all the plaudits he gets. But did his ousting in
1958 really change the course of history? To be fair, Coltart does not
explicitly say so, but his yearning that history might have worked out
differently if Todd’s rule had been allowed to run its course is very
evident: “greater liberty and economic development might have been
achieved had war been avoided” (597). Along those lines, he sees strong
continuities between settler and liberation-movement rule: “Rhodes
begat Smith and Smith begat Mugabe” (599). Ultimately, therefore,
Coltart’s regrets about missed opportunities give way to realism, and an
appreciation of the racially polarising dynamics of settler rule (14–19).1</p>
      <p>Bratton gives short shrift to any idea of a lost liberal moment in
settler politics. Indeed, he quotes Colin Leys’ 1959 assessment that the
dependence of the settler community upon its control of the state for its
presence in the country “precluded the possibility that the power would
be voluntarily shared with the rest of the population” (41). Colonial
domination, Bratton insists, started and ended with political violence, the
short-lived “internal settlement,” headed by Abel Muzorewa (1978–
1980), constituting nothing more than a last ditch attempt by settlers to
rule through conservative black agents (34). Subsequently, although the
Lancaster House settlement was politically inclusive, it was externally
driven, lacked local buy-in, and failed to overcome the racial divide.
Furthermore, ZANU-PF was to establish its hegemony and hence
readily appropriate the authoritarian legacy of the colonial state.</p>
      <p>Coltart has no doubts that the decision by the two MDCs to enter
the coalition government with ZANU-PF following the 2008 elections
was the right thing to do. Given a collapsed economy, hyperinflation and
the alarming breakout of a cholera epidemic, Zimbabwe was “in more
danger than ever of becoming a failed state” (485). Although heavy
political wrangling left ZANU-PF in control of all the coercive ministries
1</p>
      <p>
        The argument that white Rhodesia’s “last chance” was lost in 1958 is pursued
at length by
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">Holderness (1985)</xref>
        , one of Todd’s MPs. His account offers a
valuable reminder that some Rhodesian whites were genuinely liberally inclined.
However, it is ultimately unconvincing, if only because Todd would never have
become prime minister to kick-start the liberal moment had not his
predecessor, Roy Welensky, moved “upstairs” to become prime minister of the new
Central African Federation.
(Defence, Security, and Justice), Bratton contends that no option
remained but to execute the Global Political Agreement (GPA) that had
been agreed upon in September 2008, despite Mugabe having unilaterally
breached many of its key provisions. Coltart was wary of working with
ZANU-PF ministers when they had been responsible for so much
suffering, but there were no other “peaceful, non-violent” alternatives at
hand. The constructive work which he was subsequently enabled to do at
the Ministry of Education leaves him convinced that participation in the
GNU was “the right thing to do” (485). Yet when he subsequently lost
his seat at the next election, his dominant emotion was relief (577).
IntraMDC squabbling and brazen trampling over the coalition agreement by
ZANU-PF had allowed disillusion to set in. When, subsequently (after
the 2013 election), Mugabe dismissed Joice Mujuru, “any hope that the
moderates would prevail within ZANU-PF was dashed” (585), and
Zimbabwe’s prospects looked as grim as ever.
      </p>
      <p>Bratton concurs that the MDCs had little option unless they were
prepared to return to the wilderness of opposition politics. Offering a
careful analysis of the intense pressures placed upon both the MDCs and
ZANU-PF by the SADC and the AU, he points out the very different
incentives on offer. To the MDCs, second prize though it was, the
coalition offered a foot in the door to state power and the possibility of
further political reform. For ZANU-PF, it promised an easing of diplomatic
isolation and an inflow of resources to arrest the country’s economic free
fall. Above all, however, “the GNU bought time to circle the wagons,
restock the treasury (and the armory), and prepare to recapture state
power” (138). He also notes the critical fact that the settlement was a
political deal which failed to assert civilian control over the military.
Consequently, ZANU-PF entered the coalition period with a reserved
domain of power: the security complex, impenetrable to reformers, which
was “dead set against any transition to democracy or the rule of law”
(139). They would prove “military spoilers” who, enjoying direct access
to plentiful diamond revenues, exerted a veto over political reform.
Consequently, whereas the colonial political settlement had been “durable
but illegitimate,” the GNU was, in the mind of its most powerful
participants, only an interim arrangement (141).</p>
      <p>
        It may be argued that Bratton is a beneficiary of hindsight while
Coltart and his MDC colleagues had to grapple with what actions to take
when confronted by hugely circumscribed options. In essence, as argued
elsewhere
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(for example, Southall 2013)</xref>
        , the MDC was between a rock
and a hard place, and would probably have drawn extensive retrospective
criticism if it had not entered the coalition. Nonetheless, for all that
Coltart remains convinced that the MDCs were correct to join the coalition,
he also provides ample evidence that they failed to maximise even their
limited opportunities. Rivalry between leading personalities allowed
ZANU-PF to stoke division between the two MDCs, blunting their
effectiveness. This led ultimately to their competing against each other in the
2013 election (always particularly damaging to minority parties under
firstpast-the-post electoral systems). Coltart suggests that had the two MDCs
been able to come to some agreement, then the logical option – given
ZANU-PF’s blatant manipulation of the electoral regulations – would
have been to withdraw from the election, thereby compelling the SADC to
hold ZANU-PF to account. As it was, their failure to agree meant that
neither could withdraw from the election for fear of giving the other
credibility (571). In short, if this was a lost opportunity, the MDCs were
significantly to blame.

      <title>Tackling Tyranny: Dealing with the Past for a Better Future</title>
      <p>
        There is surprisingly little literature on transitional justice in Zimbabwe,
despite the fact that, under the terms of the GPA, the GNU established
the Organ for National Healing, Reconciliation, and Integration
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1 ref4 ref5">(see
Benyera 2014; Ndlovu-Gatsheni and Benyera 2015; Ngwenya and Harris
2015)</xref>
        . Perhaps this is because, however great the need for a serious
national conversation about such issues, there is simultaneously a
recognition that the time is not ripe for any such debate to lead to meaningful
measures. In essence, there is popular as well as academic recognition
that power politics has always prevailed in Zimbabwe and continues to
do so. Bratton labels this “A History of Impunity,” with both colonial
and postcolonial regimes granting sweeping amnesties to human rights
abusers (218). Yet this does not mean that the need to have such a
conversation goes away; for this reason, the contributions of both Coltart
and Bratton are to be warmly welcomed.
      </p>
      <p>Coltart identifies the cult of war pursued by both colonial and
postcolonial regimes as having poisoned Zimbabwe’s entire society. In
Zimbabwe, he argues, many political protagonists are continuing to fight the
liberation war, as if independence never happened. The wounds of that
struggle have continued to fester, and while this does not justify the
gross abuses of human rights which have taken place since 1980, it may
help to explain them. “Until we have some process to enable us all to
come to terms with our past, our past will continue to haunt us” (596).</p>
      <p>While there will be those who contest his view that the war of the 1970s
was avoidable, there will be much wider agreement that the tragedy of
contemporary Zimbabwe violence “has become an acceptable means of
resolving domestic political problems” (597). Unfortunately, however,
having highlighted the problem, save for asserting the need for the
nation to come to terms with its past if democracy and development are to
be achieved, he offers little indication of how it might be tackled.</p>
      <p>By contrast, Bratton provides us with chapter and verse of how
sweeping amnesties have been provided to those who have committed
atrocities by both the colonial and postcolonial regimes. This approach
was confirmed by the Lancaster House settlement, which pardoned
combatants from both sides of the independence war, effectively pre-empting
prosecutions or any official process to document the truth. Although
justified as a means to achieve national reconciliation, this allowed for no
moral reckoning, and denied justice to victims and survivors of human
rights abuses. With many perpetrators of violence in the war taking up
positions in the new government, including the security forces, the cycle
of impunity was reinforced. Most notoriously, a Commission of Inquiry
into the Matabeleland Disturbances (the “Gukurahundi”) – which was
established under international pressure – issued a report that was never
published, and the government never made any acknowledgement of its
culpability, not to mention offering any redress. This is the way it has
been, with political violence becoming systematically deployed as an
instrument of government, notably during elections, while perpetrators
have no fear of prosecution but every expectation of impunity.</p>
      <p>Is there any way out of this cycle? Bratton provides us with an
exemplary overview of the dilemmas of transitional justice (the trade-offs
between morality and politics) and the mechanisms which have been used
internationally and in Africa to achieve it (prosecutions, truth
commissions, amnesty, and mixed models). However, he comes to the
conclusion – citing how the institutions established under the GNU to promote
national reconciliation and human rights were stymied by lack of
resources and clear mandates – that there is little immediate prospect of
securing prosecutions or establishing a functional truth commission.
Although he hails the important work done by Zimbabwean NGOs in
providing relief to victims and gathering evidence against perpetrators of
violence for further use, he asserts that “the political reality of militarized
authoritarianism in Zimbabwe means some measure of transitional
justice may have to be denied or at least deferred” (227). Interestingly, he
cites survey data demonstrating that while consistent majorities of
respondents wanted violators to be punished, and supporters of the
country’s democratic movement vigorously oppose any suggestion of a
further blanket amnesty, generally Zimbabweans are realists. While the old
guard of power politicians remains in place, they opt for peace over
justice (226–227). Transitional justice must therefore await democracy.
But, realistically, what are the prospects for democracy?</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="sec-7">
      <title>Democracy: Damned or Delayed?</title>
      <p>Coltart agrees with Bratton that Zimbabweans, having borne the brunt
of war and violence, have pragmatically opted for peace rather than
confrontation. Support for war and violence has “never gained traction
among the vast majority of Zimbabweans” (notwithstanding, apparently,
those in the MDC whose desire to return ZANU-PF fire with fire so
dismayed Coltart during the mid-2000s). For Coltart, therefore,
nonviolent struggle would seem to represent not just a moral imperative but
politically and pragmatically the only viable way to challenge ZANU-PF.
Furthermore, rather than awaiting another messiah (whether a Tsvangirai
or a Mujuru), Zimbabweans will need to place policy and principle ahead
of personality if they wish to see a democratic dawn (600–601).</p>
      <p>We should concede that some hope of utopia is necessary if
political activism is to be sustained in seemingly impossible situations. But
what are the realistic prospects of making progress towards democracy?
Bratton provides some concluding thoughts that are simultaneously trite,
in that they are so obvious, and profound, in that Zimbabwean
democrats will only ignore them at their cost. (We may add that they are easier
said than done). Reflecting on the “decisive defeat” of the opposition in
2013, Bratton urges the MDC or successor political parties to realise that
political cohabitation with an entrenched incumbent will only undermine
opposition leaderships; there is need for ongoing party organisation,
especially in rural areas; opposition parties cannot afford factionalism,
and smaller parties should coalesce; even if external parties initiate a
power-sharing agreement, they will not push hard for political reform if
they do not feel the opposition is able to provide political order and
stability. For their part, civil society organisations need to put down
further roots into society, especially outside urban areas if they are to
offer education and hope that counters ZANU-PF hegemony. Finally, he
says, “the future of the country lies in the hands of the long-suffering
people of Zimbabwe” (244).</p>
      <p>If the bad news is that the 2013 election indicated the Zimbabwean
people felt the opposition parties had failed them, the good news is that
they have given ample indication in the past – above all, at the time of
the 2008 election – that they are prepared to mobilise behind popular
movements for change when they believe the moment is opportune.</p>
      <p>Coltart’s valedictory call (601) is that the struggle for democracy
continues. Bratton concurs, but convincingly argues that victory is far from
certain, and that even if attainable, is likely to be much delayed.</p>
