New Developments and RecentResearch Questions in the Project“Value of Children andIntergenerational Relations”Jeanette Ziehm, Isabelle Albert1Overview of the Research ProjectKurzbeitragJeanette ZiehmThe “Value of Children and Intergenerational Relations” projectis an interdisciplinary cross-cultural study on values, fertility,and intergenerational relationships. The VOC study focuses onreasons for having or not having children and investigates the in-terplay of values and parent-child relationships in three genera-tions and across cultures (cf. Trommsdorff/Kim/Nauck 2005;Trommsdorff/Nauck 2005, 2006, 2010). By now, a large data setwith N = 16.461 participants (adolescents, their mothers and ma- Isabelle Albertternal grandmothers and a sample of mothers with small chil-dren) is available from nineteen different countries in four continents.This report focuses on recent innovative research questions that are currently tackledby international researchers involved in the project. These topics refer to three thematicareas: value of children, intergenerational relations, and value transmission from a cross-cultural perspective. These research questions have been raised in the framework of a re-cent international workshop on “Value of Children and Intergenerational Relations”, or-ganized by Gisela Trommsdorff and Bernhard Nauck, principle investigators of the pro-ject, at the University of Konstanz (March 29th to 30th, 2012), and financially supportedby the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG). Some of the studies briefly summarizedbelow will be submitted for publication.2Value of Children – Cross-Cultural ComparisonsThe first part of this report concentrates on cross-cultural comparisons concerning “Valueof Children”.Gender preference. Daniela Klaus and Arun Tipandjan ask in their current work for rea-sons for higher son preference in North compared to South India (e.g., Pande/Astone2007). They assume that the higher preference for sons in North India can be explained bythe rigid patrilineal rules, higher religiosity, and dry agriculture. On the other hand, theyDiskurs Kindheits- und Jugendforschung Heft 1-2013, S. 113-118114 J. Ziehm, I. Albert: “Value of Children and Intergenerational Relations”assume that the lower son preference in South India can be explained by higher economicpositions and higher educational attainment. Initial analyses indicate that the investigatedsocio-economic factors and the cultural context can only partly explain the different re-gional son preferences. They offer the preliminary conclusion that “sex-specific costs andbenefits contribute to the explanation but they do not mediate between the consideredbackground variables and the son preference”.Cultural differences in negative VOC. Isabelle Albert, Gisela Trommsdorff, andKatarzyna Lubiewska argue that perceived negative aspects of parenthood may be im-portant for the decision not to have children and may have a special explicative value re-garding the current low fertility rates in many European countries (cf. Eurostat 2012). Inorder to take into account different levels of socio-economic change, the researchers havecompared three different cohorts living in Western and Eastern Germany as well as in Po-land in their preliminary analyses. Results show that the same negative aspects of havingchildren seem to be most prominent in all subsamples: e.g., worries about job, financialsituation, children’s future. Overall, mothers from East Germany and older mothers fromWest Germany were less concerned about having children than mothers from Poland,young mothers from West Germany and adolescents from all subsamples. In all countriesadolescents’ intentions about having children in the future were associated to their levelof negative VOC. Negative VOC was further related to actual negative experiences in thefamily and low satisfaction with the actual living situation in all subsamples and cohorts.3 Intergenerational Relations: Inter- and IntraculturalComparisonsCross-cultural variations in intergenerational relations. In his recent work, BernhardNauck argues that research on intergenerational solidarity and ambivalence suggests thatintergenerational relationships in wealthy societies are composed of both emotionalcloseness and conflicts (e.g., Silverstein et al. 2010). The aim of his work is to extend thisapproach to culturally and economically diverse areas with different kinship systems.Nauck has identified four latent classes of intergenerational relationships (‘ambivalent’,‘amicable’, ‘disharmonious’, and ‘detached’) which were valid for matrilineal, patrilineal,and bilineal kinship systems but varied in a systematic way. Results based on the VOCdata show that affection and conflict in intergenerational relationships are (apart from op-portunities, individual choices, and internalized norms) also structured by institutional set-tings. Nauck concludes that “intergenerational ambivalence is not restricted to Westernindividualism, but depends on how ‘exit’ and ‘voice’ in intergenerational relationships areinstitutionally structured in relation to emotional and functional interdependence”.Adolescents’ motivation to support parents. Kairi Kasearu and Dagmar Kutsar note thatresearch on intergenerational solidarity is mostly limited to parents and grown-up chil-dren. Hence, a current aim of the researchers is to investigate adolescents’ motives forhelping their parents in a cross-cultural comparison. Their initial analyses indicate lowerlevels of adolescents’ agreement with helping motives in Germany compared to Estoniaand Russia. In Russia, the rule-oriented and reciprocal help-giving motives were morehighly valued than in the other countries, which might indicate higher collectivism andDiskurs Kindheits- und Jugendforschung Heft 1-2013, S. 113-118 115traditional family values (which is in line with Mayer/Kuramschew/Trommsdorff 2009).In Estonia the relation-oriented motivation to help was relatively highly valued. Interest-ingly, in Estonia and to a lesser extent in Russia, the relations-oriented motive was highlypositive correlated with the rule-oriented motive. According to the researchers, both mo-tives refer to different aspects of normative solidarity: whereas external rule-oriented mo-tives refer to meeting expectations of others, the relations-oriented motive might be inter-preted as internal normative solidarity, assuming that readiness to help a parent is initiatedby the wish to sustain stability in the parent-child dyad.Intergenerational solidarity and life satisfaction. The goal of an ongoing work by Wolf-gang Friedlmeier and Katarzyna Lubiewska is to detect different dyadic structures ofintergenerational solidarity based on relevant components (affectual, consensual, asso-ciational, functional, and normative) of the intergenerational solidarity model (e.g.,Bengtson/Roberts 1991). The researchers have identified four major types of solidarity,two of which occurred more often (harmonious and amicable) while the other two oc-curred more rarely (ambivalent and distant). No cultural differences in the distributionsof patterns were found; however, dyads of daughters and mothers who did not have apartner were more often characterized by distant solidarity in Poland and by ambivalentsolidarity in the USA. Results also showed that US daughters of “distant solidarity” dyadsscored higher on life satisfaction than US daughters of “ambivalent solidarity” dyads.Polish mothers with “amicable” and “harmonious” patterns had higher life satisfactionthan Polish mothers with “distant” and “ambivalent” patterns of intergenerational soli-darity.Parenting and attachment. Katarzyna Lubiewska notes that past research has shown thattransmission of attachment is mainly associated with the quality of parenting (e.g., vanIJzendoorn/Bakermans-Kranenburg 1997). As past research included often only two gen-erations, Lubiewska is now interested in the role of grandmothers and fathers in thetransmission process (e.g., Takahashi 2005). One of her expectations is that grandmothersand fathers differ in their influence on attachment transmission among different regions ofPoland due to historical divisions and current socio-political and economical change with-in Poland. Results of first analyses indicate that a prediction of adolescents’ attachmentanxiety can only be made by parents’ attachment and parenting as “transmission belt”. In-terestingly, fathers’ anxiety was related to adolescents’ anxiety only in Southern regions,whereas paternal avoidance influenced adolescents’ anxiety only in Western regions andpaternal rejection was predictive for adolescents’ anxiety in East Poland. Further, it wasfound that culture functioned as a moderator between paternal attachment, rejection, andadolescent anxiety.4 Intergenerational Transmission of Values in Cross-CulturalComparisonThe intergenerational transmission of Value of Children. Chin-Chun Yi and Yu-Hua Chenclaim that one reason for the decreasing fertility rate in East Asia is the changing VOC(e.g., Yu 2009). Therefore, the aim of their study is to figure out the transmission of VOCin three generations in two Chinese societies, with a focus on identifying identical factor116 J. Ziehm, I. Albert: “Value of Children and Intergenerational Relations”structures for cultural contexts for positive as well as for negative VOC. Analyses haverevealed for both China and Taiwan two factors for positive (physical/social and emotion-al) as well as for negative VOC (physical/psychological constraint and familial/socialdemand). Also, as hypothesized, the intergenerational transmission was more evident forgrandmother-mother and for mother-adolescent dyads than for grandmother-adolescentdyads, especially for positive VOC. It was found that urban context and exposure to mo-dernity functioned as significant predictors for positive and negative VOC.Parent-child value similarities within and across cultures. Daniela Barni, Ariel Knafo,Asher Ben-Arieh, and Muhammed M. Haj-Yahia want to address shortcomings of earlierresearch that has typically measured intergenerational transmission of values by focusingon parent-child value similarity, thereby neglecting the role of a shared background – the“cultural stereotype” (Kenny/Acitelli 1994). In order to deal with this desideratum, the re-searchers have compared samples from two different cultural contexts, focusing on valuesimilarity between parents and adolescent children. In general, the endorsement of cultur-al stereotypes was higher for Italian than for Israeli participants, and was higher for moth-ers than for adolescents. Regarding intergenerational transmission of values it was foundthat collectivistic values were more strongly transmitted from parent to child, whereassimilarities in individualistic values could be partly explained by the effect of a culturalstereotype. The researchers conclude that the transmission of socially-supported valuesneeds little investment from the family in a value homogenous context (family as a“source of socio-cultural stability”). In a more value heterogeneous context the transmis-sion of family specific values may be more successful (family as “source of socio-culturalchange”).Adolescents’ relationship with maternal grandmothers. Mihaela Friedlmeier, Isabelle Al-bert, Gisela Trommsdorff, and Cigdem Kagitcibasi investigate at present the relationshipquality between grandmothers and grandchildren by taking into account the role of themother as a mediator. It is presumed that mothers might influence the grandchild-grandparent relation (e.g., Chan/Elder 2000). Most research on the mediating role of themiddle generation has been carried out in Western, individualistic contexts. Therefore, theauthors have chosen Germany and USA to represent individualistic cultures, and Chinaand Turkey to represent collectivist cultures. First results show that the middle generationis an important mediator between non-adjacent generations, and this may point to an in-tergenerational transmission of relationship quality. Interestingly, the quality of the ado-lescent-mother relationship was more strongly linked to the adolescent-grandmother rela-tionship than to the mother-grandmother relationship.Value of Children and intergenerational relationships in adjacent generations. The studyby Boris Mayer, Beate Schwarz, and Gisela Trommsdorff includes ten cultures and fo-cuses on country-level macro variables (social development and overall cultural orienta-tion) as well as family-related value orientations regarding intergenerational (adult daugh-ters and their mothers) relationship quality and social support. For example, it was foundthat cultural wealth was related to lower hierarchical values and lower material interde-pendence values of the family and children (which is in line with Kagitcibasi 2007). Theresearchers reason that “cultural syndromes of independence and interdependence existregarding value orientations”, and they are associated with cultural wealth. However,there was no evidence for such cultural syndromes with regard to relationship quality andDiskurs Kindheits- und Jugendforschung Heft 1-2013, S. 113-118 117support. Differences between collectivistic and individualistic cultures regarding intimatefamily relations are rather a matter of “type rather than amount of relatedness”.5 Conclusions and OutlookIn the light of ongoing demographic changes all over the world and the related socio-economic and cultural change, it has become more than ever necessary to relate context,socio-economic change, family, and individual development. The currently ongoing stud-ies within the VOC-framework take this claim into consideration by focusing and com-bining different levels of analysis in line with the culture-informed model of intergenera-tional relationships across the lifespan (see also Trommsdorff/Albert in press).For more information see: http://www.psychologie.uni-konstanz.de/en/trommsdorff/research/value-of-children-in-six-cultures/.References<ref>Bengtson, V.
