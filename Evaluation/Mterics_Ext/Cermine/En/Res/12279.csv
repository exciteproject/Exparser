Data includeddescriptions of the vaccinated children by pediatricians anddescriptions of the parents’ attitudes using a self-administeredquestionnaire. The next five successive children, under15 years old, vaccinated against varicella were included inthe study.Results Six hundred ninety-five pediatricians (F: 186; G:509) and 2,593 parents (F: 664; G: 1,929) were included inthe study. Initially, 7.1% of the German parents and 15.3%of the French parents were reluctant to have their childreninoculated with the varicella vaccine (p < 0.0001). Themain reason for their reluctance was the ‘fear ofcomplications due to the vaccination’ in both countries(G: 60.0% vs 55.5%; p: ns).

In both countries, the most convincing argumentsfor parents who were initially reluctant were ‘information onthe potential seriousness of the disease,’ which was reportedby three-quarters of the parents (G: 70.0% vs F: 74.3%;p: ns), and ‘availability of an effective, well-toleratedvaccine’ (G: 59.4% vs F: 64.0%; p: ns).Conclusion Even in the absence of an official recommen-dation, French parents will accept varicella vaccine to thesame extent as German parents where it is advisable if theyreceive appropriate information about the potential severityof the disease and the efficacy and safety of the vaccine.Keywords Varicella vaccination . General practice .Parents’ attitudeIntroductionMany studies have shown that vaccines can protect childrenand adults from bacterial and viral infections. Vaccinationhas led to important reductions in the incidences of severaldiseases and even eradication in same instances, forexample, small pox. Despite their proven effectiveness,many children do not receive vaccines because of theirparents’ philosophy or religious beliefs, their concernsabout costs, or doubts about the usefulness, safety, orefficacy of vaccines (Poland and Jacobson 2001; Taylor etal. 2002; Alfredsson et al. 2004; Fredrickson et al. 2004;Freed et al. 2004). Reluctance to use vaccines has beenfueled by reports of alleged adverse events from vaccinesspread by anti-vaccination web sites, as well as by recentvaccine recalls and modifications (Freed et al. 1996; Wolfeet al. 2002; Flanagan-Klygis et al. 2005). The situation isDO00218; No of Pages72worse when the vaccine is not universally recommended,and even when a vaccine is recommended, not allphysicians immediately adopt it in routine use.Varicella vaccine is one example for which these issueshave slowed uptake. In the US, varicella vaccination hasbeen recommended since 1996, but it took nearly 5 years toreach satisfactory coverage of more than 80% of children(Sengupta et al. 2007). This vaccination has led to areduction in the incidence of varicella of about 75% (CDC2003). Doctors must be ready to answer parents’ questionsand address misconceptions since parental beliefs may be amajor factor influencing whether a child receives thevaricella vaccine (Taylor and Newman 2000).The varicella vaccine is being increasingly used through-out Europe, although with different administrative andregulatory modalities. For example, in France, the varicellavaccine has been registered since December 2003, but thereare no national recommendations for its routine use inchildren. Recommendations exist for health-care and child-care workers, those who have close contacts with immu-nocompromised people, and children requiring a solidorgan transplant, and for people, at least 18 years old,within 3 days of contact with an infected person. Inaddition, this vaccine is not reimbursed by the health-careinsurance system. In contrast, in Germany, routine admin-istration to healthy children has been officially recommen-ded since July 2004, and it is reimbursed in mostadministrative areas (Rasch and Hellenbrand 2004). Thus,Germany and France provide an interesting comparison forstudying the effect of recommendations and funding on theattitudes of parents concerning varicella vaccination. Forthis we surveyed parents of children that were vaccinatedagainst varicella by private pediatricians or general practi-tioners in Germany and France between March 2005 andMarch 2006.Materials and methodsThe purpose of this cross-sectional study conductedbetween March 2005 and March 2006 was to ascertainphysicians’ and parents’ attitudes towards varicella vacci-nation acceptance and to compare them between Germany(G), where routine varicella vaccination is recommended inchildren, and France (F), where it is not. Two samples of600 pediatricians (or GPs with essentially child-orientedpractices) selected at random in France and Germany wereinvolved. They were asked to include the next fivesuccessive children they vaccinated against varicella duringthe next month. These recruitment conditions led in eachcountry to a sample of 3,000 cases providing a confidenceinterval of under 2% in case of an observed percentageunder 5%. This choice was made due to the fact that weJ Public Health (2009) 17:71–76expected a low value for some questions, in particular forthe spontaneous request for varicella vaccination, especiallyin France, where it is not reimbursed. These children had tobe under 15 years of age and had to have no contra-indications to the vaccine. Information on the maindemographic and clinical characteristics of the vaccinatedchildren as well as why the parents accepted the vaccinationwas recorded by the physician on the physician’s question-naire. Information on the parents’ attitudes concerning thevaricella vaccination was recorded on a self-administeredquestionnaire that the pediatrician gave them after havingexplained how to fill it in. This questionnaire was returneddirectly to the data analysis center in a prepaid envelope toprotect anonymity. A common number included in the twodocuments allowed matching the pediatrician form with theself-administered questionnaire for the purposes of thestatistical analysis.Results are expressed as means with their standarddeviations for quantitative variables and by numbers andfrequency distributions for qualitative variables. Chi-squareanalysis and analysis of variance were respectively per-formed to compare qualitative and quantitative valuesbetween France and Germany. A P-value of less than 0.05was considered to indicate statistical significance.ResultsPopulation and context of the vaccinationBetween March 2005 and March 2006, 509 Germanpediatricians participated in the study and only 186 Frenchpediatricians because of some recruitment difficulties inrelation to the absence of varicella vaccination recommen-dations in France. This point will be discussed. Thequestionnaire was given to the parents of 3,033 vaccinatedchildren. A total of 2,593 questionnaires was returned(85.6% response rate; 1,929 from Germany and 664 fromFrance). The mean age, percentage of girls, family size, andrank of the vaccinated children were similar for the twocountries (Table 1). The only variable that was significantlydifferent was the parent’s education level: 36.1% of parentsin Germany vs. 55.3% of parents in France were universityor advanced technical college graduates (P< 0.0001).The rate of spontaneously requested varicella vaccina-tion was significantly higher for German parents than forFrench parents (20.9% vs 12.6%; P< 0.0001). As shown inFig. 1, except for ‘avoid illness’ and ‘child living in closecontact with other children,’ which are the two mainreasons for spontaneous requests for vaccination, nearlyall the other reasons given by parents were significantlydifferent between the two countries: ‘Prevent complica-tions’ was mentioned more often in Germany than inJ Public Health (2009) 17:71–76Table 1 Family characteristics of vaccinated childrenVariableChilds’ age (years ± SD)Girls (%)Parents’ education: university or technical college graduate (%)Number of children in the family (mean ± SD)Rank of the vaccinated child (mean ± SD)SD: standard deviation; NS: not statistically significantComparison between Germany and FranceFrance (51.4% vs 41.5%; P < 0.01), and the difference waseven larger for ‘information on the varicella vaccine in themedia’ (42.3% vs 19.2%; P < 0.0001). The reasons for aspontaneous request for varicella vaccination were lessoften in Germany than in France ‘avoid social andprofessional impact of child’s illness’ (29.1% vs 47.7%;P < 0.0001), ‘child’s relative currently has varicella’ (5.6%and 21.5%; P < 0.0001), and ‘avoid scarring’ (20.5% vs29.6%; p < 0.05).Parents’ opinions concerning varicella vaccinationThe analysis of the parents’ questionnaire (Fig. 2) revealsthat 7.1% of the German and 15.3% of the French parentswere initially reluctant to allow their children to receive thevaricella vaccine (P < 0.0001). The two main reasons fortheir reluctance were similar in the two countries, and bothconcerned the vaccination itself: ‘Complications followingvaccination’ (G: 60.0% vs F: 55.5%; p: ns) and ‘too manyvaccinations’ (G: 43.0% vs F: 40.6%; p: ns).

The other reasons, indecreasing order of importance, were information that‘varicella is frequent and contagious’ and ‘prevention ofvaricella scars’ and ‘impact on the family of the disease.’Finally, the fact that vaccination is free of charge inGermany was indicated as an advantage by 23.4% of theGerman parents.74Fig. 2 Reasons for parents’initial reluctance to acceptvaricella vaccination.Comparison between Germanyand FranceJ Public Health (2009) 17:71–76DiscussionIn the current study, we investigated parents’ attitudes toaccepting varicella vaccination between France and Germanyand the best way to convince them to have their childrenvaccinated.The comparison with Germany was chosen because itwas the first country in Europe that added varicellavaccination to the national routine vaccination schedulefor all children; it was the first country in the EuropeanUnion to do this. The Ständige Impfkommission (StandingCommittee on Vaccination, STIKO) at the Robert KochInstitute in Germany announced the change in theirpublished update to the national vaccine schedule (RobertKoch-Institut 2004a, b). According to these officialrecommendations, varicella vaccination is scheduled forinfants aged between 11 and 14 months (given preferablyat the same time as the MMR vaccine). Catch-upvaccination for children and adults is recommended, inparticular for persons aged 9–17 years who have not hadvaricella infection. In France, no such recommendationexists, and the comparison with Germany was done inorder to evaluate the impact of this recommendation and,moreover, to analyze if the existence a such recommen-dations was a sine qua non condition to the spreading ofthe varicella vaccine.Potential biases should be considered before generalizingthe results to all parents of young children.Fig. 3 Most convincingarguments in favor of varicellavaccination. Comparisonbetween Germany and FranceJ Public Health (2009) 17:71–76The most important possible bias is that the physicianswho agreed to participate in the study may be those who aremost in favor of varicella vaccination and therefore themost inclined to convince the parents. This bias isunavoidable, but its influence would be the same in bothcountries. This potential bias may also have had someimpact on the parents’ opinion, but the effect would havebeen minimal because the parents completed a strictlyanonymous self-administered questionnaire that they sentdirectly to the data analysis center.One other bias could be linked to the fact that the rate ofpediatricians participating to the study in France was muchlower than in Germany. The lack of a recommendation in favorof varicella vaccination in France (and consequently theabsence of reimbursement) explains why many practitionersare still reluctant to propose it to parents and thus the difficultieswe met recruiting regular varicella vaccine prescribers. Theserecruitment difficulties have an unavoidable effect on theprecision of the results, providing an average confidenceinterval of 2% for the German data and of 4% for the Frenchdata rather than the initially expected <2%. However,taking into account that the lowest percentage described forthe French sample is 12.6% of spontaneously requestedvaricella vaccination, this precision of 4% still appearssatisfactory.Another limit of our study is also due to the fact that weonly considered vaccinated children, while it could havebeen interesting to describe the attitude and intentions fromthe parents who refused the vaccination of their child. Thischoice to focus our study on vaccination acceptance andeventual previous reluctance and not on refusal wasdictated by the lack of recommendation for varicellavaccination in France. Also, a written inquiry about thepatient’s refusal could have been interpreted by the healthauthority as an unacceptable attempt to strongly influencethem, and the rate of spontaneous answer would have beenvery low.Despite potential biases and limits, our results revealedthat the presence of a recommendation for the vaccinationin Germany and its absence in France have a major impacton the parents’ knowledge about the disease and itscomplications as well as on health-care promotion of thevaccine.A first remark concerns the educational level of theparents of the vaccinated children, which was higher inFrance than in Germany. This reflects that in France, due tothe lack of official recommendation and of reimbursement,the educational level and the level of income of parents hasa strong influence on the acceptance of varicella.Due to the availability of an official recommendation,more German parents were aware of the varicella vaccineand spontaneously requested vaccination. In addition, theirreasons for requesting vaccination were different. German75parents identified the main purpose of the vaccine aspreventing complications and were convinced by informationfrom the media, whereas the French parents’ motivations werelinked to the social and professional consequences of thedisease, the prevention of infection of others, or the fear ofscars. These findings suggest that even the French parents whospontaneously requested the vaccine were not aware of theseriousness of the complications of varicella. In Germany, theparents’ attitudes are similar to those described for parents inthe US (Taylor and Newman 2000). In particular, when arecommendation exists, parents are more convinced about theadvantages of the vaccine to prevent serious complicationsthan its ability to reduce time lost from work.The percentage of parents reluctant to accept varicellavaccination in the current study does not reflect thepercentage in the global population; it reflects the initialrate of reluctance of parents who finally agreed to havetheir children vaccinated. Thus, the percentages reportedhere cannot be used as the basis for making conclusionsabout the reluctance for vaccination in the overall popula-tion. The parents’ reluctance is mostly due to the fact thatthey consider varicella to be a harmless disease and, aboveall, fear of complications from the vaccine. The percentagesof parents who were reluctant due to fear of complicationsof the vaccine (55.5% in France and 60.0% in Germany)are similar to that reported in the US (69%) (Salmon et al.2005). The high proportion of French parents who said theywere reluctant because the varicella vaccine is too recent(45.5%) is surprising, but is probably due to the fact thatsince varicella vaccine is not officially recommended inFrance, little information on varicella vaccination istargeted to the general population. This is illustrated bythe fact that nearly half the French parents in our studywere unaware that a varicella vaccine has been available formore than 10 years in the US, compared with 5.9% inGermany.Differences in reluctance to have children vaccinated dueto cost were not as big as expected. However, this findingmay be biased by the socioeconomic profile of the Frenchparticipants; on average, they have a higher educationallevel and therefore a higher income than their Germancounterparts. We cannot, therefore, conclude that Frenchparents are probably more willing to pay than Germanparents. This finding could suggest that, in the absence ofreimbursement, the use of the vaccine will be dependent onthe parents’ incomes.Our results show that in both countries the mostconvincing argument in favor of the varicella vaccine isthe information given by the practitioner regarding theseriousness of the disease and the availability of a well-tolerated vaccine. The results from a study in the US, wherethe varicella vaccine has been recommended for more than10 years, were similar; the most frequent factor influencing76parents’ decision was their doctor’s advice (Freeman andFreed 1999).In summary, our results show that both German andFrench parents readily accepted varicella vaccination whenthe practitioner recommended it and/or when they wereappropriately informed about the potential severity ofvaricella disease and the safety of the vaccine, irrespectiveof an official recommendation and reimbursement for thevaccine. However, the absence of reimbursement mayaffect some parents’ decision, due to the cost, and therefore,this may lead to social inequality.Conflict of Interest The authors Antoine Blanc, Yves Megard, andIsabelle Bertand are full-time employees of Sanofi Pasteur MSD.
