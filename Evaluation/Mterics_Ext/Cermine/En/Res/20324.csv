Thisarticle differs from previous studies by examining the bilateral trade among alltrading partners within a set of partners. Using a panel data approach, we ﬁnd thatdifferences in factor endowments seem not to be important as a driving force behindvertical intra-industry trade for European countries over the chosen period. Moreimportant driving forces are production size, geographical proximity, averageincome per capita and income distribution overlap.KeywordsVertical intra-industry tradeEuropean tradePanel dataJEL ClassiﬁcationF10F14F151 IntroductionTrade between two countries within a product category is characterized as intra-industry trade (IIT) if both export and import exist, and IIT is characterized ashorizontal (HIIT) if trade consists of varieties of the same quality, and as vertical(VIIT) if the varieties are of a different quality. Empirical research1 points out thatVIIT is the dominant type of total IIT.A common feature of the above mentioned investigations is the analysis of tradebetween a given reference country and a set of partners. The empirical results are1 See e.g. Greenaway et al. (1995), Aturupane et al.

Lüthjenot unambiguous with regard to the relationship between differences in factorendowments between trade partners on the one side and the two types of IIT on theother. It is possible that the estimated relationships depend on the reference country.Therefore, it is relevant to examine the bilateral trade among all partners within a setof partners. Such an analysis has not yet been conducted in the internationalliterature. We conduct an econometric analysis of European VIIT in manufacturedgoods from 1996 to 2005. The countries are the EU-15 countries and four EastEuropean countries: Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic. The choiceof countries is determined by two considerations: (1) the availability of data for bothtrade ﬂows and explanatory variables and (2) the countries should operate on acommon market so that problems of trade barriers etc. can be left out ofconsideration. We also analyze the implications of geographical proximity. Thisdeterminant captures such factors as similarities in language and culture and therebysimilarity of consumer patterns. Finally, we investigate the role of incomedistribution overlap between countries and the effect of production size.In Sect. 2, theoretical foundations and empirical applications are discussed. Themeasurement of IIT is worked through in Sect. 3, and after some preliminaryinvestigations in Sect. 4, explanatory variables and hypotheses are listed in Sect. 5.The results of the econometric estimations are shown in Sects. 6, and 7 concludesthe article.2 Theoretical foundationsIn this section, we discuss theoretical foundations of determinants that may explainVIIT. We discuss the effect of income distribution overlap, difference in factorendowment, production size and geographical proximity. By capital endowment wemean physical capital, technological capital as well as human capital. In theanalysis, we discuss both the demand side and the production side.The theoretical framework of VIIT is rooted in the work of Linder (1961)although he did not use the term VIIT explicitly. Linder assumes that the individualdemand for quality of a given variety is increasing with income. Considering twocountries, an overlap in income distribution determines whether the demand for agiven good will exist in both countries. Within this overlap, consumers with lowincomes demand low-quality varieties, whereas high-income consumers demandhigh-quality varieties. However, the overlap in income distribution can be so smallthat low quality goods demanded in the low-income country are not demanded inthe high-income country. The same applies to high-quality goods. Therefore, avariety on a given quality level is not demanded in both countries, and then VIIT inthis good cannot exist2. Falvey and Kierzkowski (1987), Flam and Helpman (1987),Stokey (1991) and Copeland and Kotwal (1996) also assign a central role to incomedistributions. Moreover, the level of income per capita is determined by the capitalintensity, thus the capital-abundant countries have a relatively high income per2 Linder (1961), Falvey and Kierzkowski (1987), Stokey (1991), Copeland and Kotwal (1996) andMurphy and Shleifer (1997).123Driving forces of vertical intra-industry trade in Europe 1996–2005471capita, and the labor-abundant countries have a relatively low income per capita.Our ﬁrst hypothesis isH1: We expect VIIT to be more prominent among countries with a high degree ofincome distribution overlap.Turning to the production side, the quality level of a product variety increaseswith capital intensity. If a given good is produced in two countries, one of which iscapital-abundant and the other is labor-abundant (or less capital-abundant), we mayassume that the capital-abundant country produces high-quality varieties, whereasthe labor-abundant (or the less capital-abundant) country produces low-qualityvarieties. Depending on the demand in the two countries, as discussed above, VIITwill arise3. Many authors in empirical analysis expect a positive relationshipbetween VIIT and differences in factor endowments, see e.g. Durkin and Krygier(2000), Mart´ın-Montaner and R´ıos (2002), Mora (2002), Crespo and Fontoura(2004) and Zhang et al. (2005). However, it is not sufﬁcient to look at theproduction side; the demand side needs to be included too as discussed above. Sincea large difference in factor endowments between two countries also indicates a largedifference in income per capita, we may even expect VIIT to be small in case of atoo large difference in factor endowments.When we turn to the empirical evidence of the effect of differences in factorendowments on VIIT, Mart´ın-Montaner and R´ıos (2002) and Mora (2002) use thethree above mentioned variables as a proxy of capital: physical capital, technolog-ical capital and human capital.4 Mart´ın-Montaner and R´ıos (2002) ﬁnd a positiverelationship between VIIT and the three variables, whereas Mora (2002) ﬁnds anegative relationship between VIIT and physical capital. The two other capitalvariables show a positive relationship, although not signiﬁcant, as regards humancapital. Durkin and Krygier (2000) investigate HIIT and VIIT in relation to physicalcapital and use as a proxy of the latter, GDP per capita. They ﬁnd a positiverelationship with VIIT. One the one hand, some of the estimated relationships areinsigniﬁcant, depending on how IIT is separated into HIIT and VIIT. Crespo andFontoura (2004) also use GDP per capita as a proxy of physical capital and ﬁnd apositive relationship with VIIT. On the other hand, Gullstrand (2002b), who alsouses GDP per capita as a proxy of physical capital, expects a negative relationshipwith VIIT. However, his empirical results do not support any explanatory power ofdifferences in factor endowments. Finally, it cannot be ruled out that differences infactor endowments at industry level have a different impact on VIIT. Mora (2002:pp 308–310) ﬁnds that at industry level for some industries the relationship ispositive and for other industries negative with regard to differences in factorendowments. Since we chose VIIT as an aggregated index over industries, theheterogeneity of industries in relation to a trading partner country has implicationsfor the direction of the relationship between the absolute difference in factorendowments and VIIT. In other words the effect of differences in factor3 Falvey (1981), Falvey and Kierzkowski (1987), Flam and Helpman (1987), Stokey (1991), Davis(1995), Copeland and Kotwal (1996) and Murphy and Shleifer (1997).4 More precisely, Mora (2002) investigates high-quality VIIT.123472L. Jensen, T. Lüthjeendowments is not equal for all countries. Therefore, country-speciﬁc effects ofdifferences in factor endowments have to be investigated too. It appears that theempirical results are not unambiguous as regards the relationship betweendifferences in factor endowments and VIIT. This is also conﬁrmed in an analysisby Jensen and Lüthje (2008). Hence we can introduce our second hypothesisH2: The effect of differences in factor endowments on VIIT depends on tradepartners.The size of an economy matters too. The greater the size of an economy is, themore industries will exist due to economies of scale. In order for VIIT to exist in agiven good, both trading partners have to produce the good. A given good will morelikely be produced in a large economy than in a small economy due to diversity ofindustries. Our third hypothesis isH3: The larger the production size of the trading partners is, the larger VIIT willbe.A pair of countries with very different industry structures and/or demand patternswill necessarily have a lower VIIT than a pair of countries with coincident industrystructures and/or demand patterns. Since countries that are close to each othergeographically will tend to have relatively similar industry structures and demandpatterns due to e.g. linguistic and cultural similarities, VIIT may be larger amongsuch pairs of countries (see also Linder 1961). Furthermore, the information costsincrease with geographical distance thereby hampering VIIT. Finally, geographicalproximity also reﬂects transportation costs. The smaller the transportation costs are,the larger is VIIT. In fact, a robust empirical ﬁnding is that IIT and accordinglyVIIT decline with distance between trading partners (for further details seeVenables and Rice 2003). Accordingly, we can formulate our fourth hypothesisH4: A. The more similar industry structures between the pair of trading countriesare, the larger is VIIT.B. The more similar demand patterns are between the pair of tradingcountries are, the larger is VIIT.C. The smaller the information and transportation costs between the pair oftrading countries are, the larger is VIIT.3 Measurement of intra-industry tradeIIT between two countries of a product category j is measured by the Grubel andLloyd (1975) index:IITj ¼ 1jXjXj þ MjMjjð1Þwhere Xj and Mj are the value of export respectively import inside product categoryj, |Xj - Mj| the net trade, (Xj ? Mj) is the value of the total trade. Accordingly, the123473ð2Þð3Þð4ÞDriving forces of vertical intra-industry trade in Europe 1996–2005part of foreign trade characterized by being inter-industry is 1 - IITj. An aggregateindex of total IIT between two countries can be attained as a weighted sum of IITindices:IIT ¼Xj1jXjXj þ MjMjjXj þ MjPk Xk þ Mk¼ 1Pj jXjPj Xj þ MjMjjIn order to split the IIT index into a horizontally and a vertically differentiatedpart Greenaway et al.

IIT is considered to consist ofhorizontally differentiated products if unit values satisfy the condition11 þ dUVjxUVjm1 þ dwhere UVjx and UVjm are the unit values of imports and exports of product category j,and d a chosen dispersion factor. Otherwise, IIT is considered to consist of verticallydifferentiated products.Fontagnéand Freudenberg (1997) and Greenaway et al. (1995) separatevertically differentiated products from horizontally differentiated products by theuse of a dispersion factor of 15 or 25%. In order to evaluate the robustness of theresults, Greenaway et al. (1995), Aturupane et al. (1999), Durkin and Krygier(2000), Gullstrand (2002a), Mora (2002) and Crespo and Fontoura (2004) conduct aregression analysis for both dispersion factors and ﬁnd that the results are notparticularly sensitive as regards the chosen dispersion factor. See Nielsen and Lüthje(2002) and Lüthje (2003) for a further discussion of this method.The index of IIT is calculated from data from OECD’s CD-ROM databaseInternational Trade by Commodities Statistics HS, 1996–2005 for manufacturedgoods at a 6-digit product level of the harmonized system (HS) nomenclature (seeTable 5 in the Appendix).4 Preliminary investigationsAn IIT index measuring intra-industry trade between two countries should remaininvariant if it is calculated from trade data reported by a certain country or by datareported from its trade partner due to the symmetry of the formulas. To see whetherthis is the case, correlations between IIT indices based on trade data reported by acountry and data reported by its partner are shown in Table 1.123autdeudnkespﬁnfragbrgrcirlitanldprtswebelczehunpolsvk1661661661651661661661661651621651661671191651641661520.880.900.910.870.920.910.910.830.770.930.850.890.930.900.900.860.880.870.770.730.570.780.680.830.690.420.320.850.770.740.720.770.680.490.700.690.940.970.940.970.950.980.960.840.820.970.950.950.970.950.950.910.940.92474Table 1 Correlations of indicesbased on a report country andpartner countries as reportcountry (d = 15%)L. Jensen, T. LüthjeCountryNCorrelations Correlations Correlationsof VIIT indices of HIIT indices of IIT indicesWith respect to Ireland, Greece and Hungary, the reported trade data are not inaccordance with the ﬁgures reported by the partners as regards HIIT. The problemmay be caused by erroneously reported trade quantities. These are used to calculateunit values that serve as a basis to separate horizontal trade from vertical. As regardsIIT, only trade amounts are used and the two sets of reported indices seem to bereasonably in accordance for all countries. Since correlations of VIIT indices basedon report country and partner countries are high, it is reasonable to use an average ofthe VIIT index of a report country and the partner country as the report country asour measure of VIIT. According to our data, VIIT is the more dominant type of IITwithin European trade. Calculating the fraction of VIIT of total IIT, we found anaverage of 81%.In Table 2, the average bilateral VIIT from 1996 to 2005 is shown. On theone hand, countries such as Germany, France and Great Britain have a relativelyhigh VIIT with the European countries as a whole. These countries arecharacterized by being at the same economic and cultural level and by beinglarge economies. The bilateral VIIT between these countries is at a higher levelthan with other countries. On the other hand, countries such as Greece, Portugal,Finland, Ireland, Poland and Slovakia have a relatively low bilateral VIIT.Furthermore, it appears from Table 2 that geographical proximity matters.Countries far from each other have lower VIIT than countries close to eachother.123Driving forces of vertical intra-industry trade in Europe 1996–2005475g 9 0 8 8 8 8 1 4 5 6 5 2 0 1 3 0 2 8 7v .1 .2 .1 .2 .1 .1 .1 .2 .2 .0 .1 .1 .2 .2 .1 .1 .1 .1 .1A 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0E-4e 0 2 3 7 6 6 0 1 6 3 4 0 0 1 7 6 1 8w .2 .2 .1 .2 .3 .1 .3 .2 .2 .0 .1 .1 .2 .2 .1 .0 .1 .1s 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0E-49 2 4 1 7 3 3 6 1 2 4 7 1 4 1 5 1 2E-5vk .1 .1 .2 .2 .0 .1 .0 .1 .1 .0 .1 .0 .1 .1 .1 .0 .1 .1s 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0E-49 4 8 1 8 6 3 2 4 3 5 4 3 2 4 5 6 0E-5tr .0 .1 .0 .2 .0 .2 .0 .2 .1 .0 .0 .0 .1 .1 .0 .0 .0 .1p 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0E-4l 3 2 9 5 7 5 9 6 4 4 4 5 5 5 4 1 7 3o .1 .1 .1 .2 .1 .1 .0 .1 .1 .0 .1 .0 .1 .1 .0 .1 .1 .1p 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0E-51 5 0 5 4 2 1 1 1 9 6 9 3 5 2 4 1 1E-5ld .2 .3 .2 .3 .2 .2 .1 .3 .4 .0 .1 .1 .2 .1 .1 .1 .2 .2n 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0E-53 4 8 2 0 4 0 2 1 8 9 2 3 5 3 1 0 0E-5ta .2 .2 .1 .3 .2 .2 .1 .3 .3 .0 .1 .1 .2 .1 .1 .1 .2 .2i 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0E-52 9 3 5 0 6 9 8 3 3 9 2 9 5 4 7 0 2E-5lr .1 .0 .1 .1 .1 .0 .0 .1 .3 .0 .0 .1 .1 .0 .0 .0 .1 .1i 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0E-5un .30 .11 .51 .82 .21 .0 3 9 6 39 9 6 4 5 4 4 51 .1 .1 .1 .0 .0 .1 .1 .1 .0 .1 .1 .1h 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0E-58 5 2 0 2 6 1 9 5 3 3 8 9 4 3 2 3 6E-5rc .0 .0 .0 .1 .1 .0 .0 .0 .1 .0 .0 .0 .0 .0 .0 .0 .0 .0g 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0E-5rb .32 .29 .02 .83 .82 .29 .16 .39 .1 .1 .3 .3 .4 .1 .1 .1 .2 .25 6 3 1 1 4 4 1 6 5g 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0E-51 4 7 0 2 2 2 9 9 9 8 2 1 6 2 6 1 4E-5.2 .3 .2 .4 .2 .3 .1 .3 .0 .1 .1 .3 .3 .1 .2 .1 .2 .20 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0E-51 2 8 1 6 6 2 6 1 3 9 0 1 9 3 3 0 11 n .1 .1 .0 .2 .1 .0 .1 .1 .0 .1 .0 .1 .1 .0 .0 .0 .3 .1, ﬁ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0seirtn 5 4 0 2 8 6 2 9 6 0 6 4 2 5 6 3 6 8u p .1 .2 .2 .3 .1 .0 .3 .2 .0 .1 .0 .2 .2 .1 .2 .1 .1 .1co se 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 06 1 2 0 8 6 2 8 2 2 0 0 4 7 8 7 6 8E-5.1 .2 .1 .3 .1 .1 .2 .2 .1 .1 .1 .2 .2 .1 .0 .0 .3 .10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 05 6 9 0 2 1 0 8 0 8 5 2 5 5 1 1 7 8E-5th ui e .3 .3 .3 .3 .3 .2 .4 .3 .1 .2 .1 .3 .3 .2 .2 .2 .2 .2w d 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 08 6 9 2 0 8 7 0 2 5 3 8 0 9 8 4 3 8lV ze .2 .1 .3 .1 .2 .0 .2 .2 .0 .1 .1 .1 .2 .1 .0 .2 .1 .1a c 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0retali 9 6 6 1 4 2 4 9 5 1 9 4 5 2 4 2 2 0b le .1 .1 .3 .2 .2 .1 .3 .2 .0 .1 .0 .2 .3 .1 .1 .1 .2 .2e b 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0garev9 8 5 6 5 1 1 3 8 0 2 3 1 3 9 9 0 9tA u .1 .2 .3 .1 .1 .1 .2 .2 .0 .3 .1 .2 .2 .1 .0 .1 .2 .1a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0500 fra2–699naep kruo dnEniTII2elbaTau eb zc ed dn se ﬁn fra gb rg uh ilr ita ld lo tr kv e gt l e u k p r c nw vn p p s s A1234765 Explanatory variables and hypothesisL. Jensen, T. LüthjeIn this section, we operationalize the following explanatory variables: factorendowment, production size, proximity, income distribution overlap and averageGDP.5.1 Explanatory variables5.1.1 Income distribution overlapA measure of the income distribution overlap between two countries is calculatedas follows: Let p1 denote the proportion of the population in the poorer countrythat has an income below the 20% quintile of the income distribution of the richercountry. Furthermore, let p2 denote the proportion of the population in the richercountry that has an income above the 80% quintile of the income distribution inthe poorer country. If the income distribution overlap is small, then both p1 and p2will be large. If income distributions are identical, i.e. with full overlap, then bothp1 and p2 will be 20%. As a measure of income distribution overlap, INCO, wecalculatep1þp220:2INCO ¼ 10:7The factor 0.7 in the denominator is due to the calculation of p1 and p2 fromincome distribution data that are in the form of deciles. Then the maximum of p1and p2 is 0.9. In practice, the minimum value of INCO is 0 indicating virtuallyno overlap in income distributions. If income distributions are identical, thenINCO is 1.Income distribution data for the European countries are calculated partly fromincome share data (household disposal income earned within each decile) in WorldIncome Inequality Database (WIID 2C) for a single year (around 1999 for mostcountries) and partly from GDP per capita data from OECD in 2000 dollars andpurchasing power parties (PPP). From the two sources deciles of incomedistribution can be interpolated. A similar calculation is used by Durkin andKrygier (2000).5.1.2 Factor endowmentAs in Mart´ın-Montaner and R´ıos (2002) and Mora (2002), we decompose capitalinto three variables: physical capital, technological capital and human capital.We measure the endowment of human capital by the fraction of the population,25–64 years of age that has attained at least upper secondary education. This is acommonly used measure of human capital; see e.g. Barro and Lee (1993), Mora(2002) and Gullstrand (2002a, b). Data is from Eurostat’s Internet database for theperiod from 1996 to 2005. Accordingly, the difference in the endowment of humancapital, DHKL, is measured by the absolute difference between the fraction of thepopulation that has attained at least upper secondary education.123Driving forces of vertical intra-industry trade in Europe 1996–2005477Technological capital, TK, is measured by the cumulated value of R&Dexpenditures, see e.g. Coe and Helpman (1995) and Mora (2002), and is calculatedby the use of the perpetual inventory method as followsTKt ¼ ð1dÞTKt 1 þ RDEt 1TKt is the technological capital for the year t, and d is the depreciation rate whichis assumed to be 15%.5 RDE is R&D expenditure estimated in 2000 US$ and PPPand is based on data from the OECD. The initial technological capital stock, TK0, iscalculated asTK0 ¼ RDE0=ð1 þ dÞwhere RDE0 is R&D expenditure in the ﬁrst year, and l is the average annuallogarithmic growth rate of R&D expenditures over the analyzed period. Thetechnological capital for each year is divided by the level of employment to obtainthe technological capital stock per worker, TKL. Thereby, the difference in theendowment of technological capital can be measured by the absolute difference intechnological capital per worker, DTKL.The physical capital per worker, PKL, is in 2000 US$ and PPP. As in Leamer(1984) the physical capital is measured by the depreciated sum of cumulated grossdomestic investment using the perpetual inventory method. We use data from 1970to 2007 from the OECD, and the depreciation rate is 7%.6 Thereby, the difference inthe endowment of physical capital can be measured by the absolute difference inphysical capital per worker, DPKL.5.1.3 Production sizeThe production size of a country is normally measured by the country’s GDP, seee.g. Crespo and Fontoura (2004), but, as the focus of the analysis is on the industrialproduction, GDP is too broad a measure. A more suitable measure of a country’sproduction size in relation to its trading partners seems to be the country’s share ofthe total industrial production of all the analyzed countries, p. Accordingly, wemeasure the production size of a country by the country’s share of the totalindustrial production of the analyzed European countries. We use OECD data forthe year 2001.The logarithm of the average share of production between partnercountries is denoted ASP.ASP ¼ logp1 þ p22where pi is country i’s share of production.5 See Coe and Helpman (1995). Alternative measures of technological capital were also calculatedassuming d to be 5 and 10% with similar results (Coe and Helpman 1995: pp 883–886). Mora (2002)assumes 15% too.6 See Benhabib and Spiegel (1994). Depreciation rates of 4 and 10% give very similar results (Benhabiband Spiegel 1994: p 167). Mora (2002) and Crespo and Fontoura (2004) assume 7% too.1234785.1.4 Geographical proximityL. Jensen, T. LüthjeIn a European context, geographical proximity captures similarities in partlylanguage and culture, and thereby similarity of consumer patterns, and partlyindustry structures. Furthermore, geographical proximity also reﬂects informationand transportation costs. The more similar countries are and the smaller thetransportation costs are, the larger is VIIT. We measure geographical proximity byDISTANCE: distance between capitals.75.1.5 Average GDPIn the analysis, we also include the average GDP per capita between two countries,AGDPC, i.e. between country a and country b asAGDPC ¼GDP GDPCAPITAa þ CAPITAb2A higher standard of living will lead to a higher demand for differentiatedproducts and thereby a higher VIIT (see Gullstrand 2002a: pp 328–331).Furthermore, since Gullstrand (2002b) and Crespo and Fontoura (2004) ﬁnd aninteraction between difference in income distribution within countries (measured asdifference in GINI coefﬁcients) and difference in GDP per capita, we may suspectthe effect of AGDPC to depend on INCO. The sign of the interaction will bedetermined empirically.5.2 ModelSome of the explanatory variables from the present panel data set are time-dependent (DPKL, AGDPC, INCO, DHKL and DTKL) while others are time-invariant (ASP and DISTANCE). Since VIIT is bounded between 0 and 100%, alinear model will not guarantee expected values between these limits. Consequently,a logistic transformation of VIIT is employed. The data are analyzed by means of(mixed) linear models of the form (see e.g. Frees 2004):lnVIITit1VIITit¼ yit ¼ X1itb1i þ X2ib2 þ ai þ eitð5Þin which i is an index of country pair and t is an index of time. X1 is a rowvector of the time dependent variables, and X2 is a row vector of the timeindependent variables (including a constant to capture an intercept). ai capturescountry pair-speciﬁc effects (omitted time-invariant explanatory variables), and eis a stochastic residual. The models cannot handle the extreme values 0 and 100%,but such values do not occur in the data set. According to the model, theregression coefﬁcients in b1i may eventually depend on the variable country pair.Hence, the model permits interaction between country pair and the time-dependentexplanatory variables.7 In the case of Germany, we use Frankfurt am Main.123Driving forces of vertical intra-industry trade in Europe 1996–20054796 Econometric estimationsA problem with panel data models, as speciﬁed in model (5), is the possiblecorrelation between a and the explanatory variables (see e.g. Hausman and Taylor1981). Treating a as a random variable (a variance component), generalized leastsquares (GLS), in the case of correlation between a and the explanatory variables,results in biased and inconsistent estimates of regression coefﬁcients (Hausman andTaylor 1981). A possible solution to overcome such a problem is to use so-called‘‘within’’ estimates of regression coefﬁcients where the ai’s are treated as ﬁxedconstants that enter the model in the form of dummy variables. These ‘‘within’’estimates are unbiased and consistent even in the presence of correlation between aand the explanatory variables. However, by this procedure it is not possible toestimate effects of the time-invariant explanatory variables. Then if the analysisindicates correlation between a and the explanatory variables, a robust estimationprocedure has to be sought out. Yet another problem with panel data models of type(5) is the possibility of heteroscedasticity of the residual e as well as correlations ofsome form among country pair residuals. We address this problem by using robuststandard errors (White 1980; Liang and Zeger 1986) in the estimation of standarderrors. In some of the models, we allow for serial correlation. All the models areestimated by maximum likelihood.The results of the econometric estimations are shown in Table 3 with a dispersionfactor d = 15%, and in Table 4 with a dispersion factor d = 25%. In column (1) inTable 3, a model neglecting the variance component a is estimated by OLS. In caseof no correlation between a and the explanatory variables, OLS will result inunbiased and consistent estimates of regression coefﬁcients, although standarderrors of the estimates are upward biased and thus not reliable. In case of correlationbetween a and the explanatory variables, the estimates are biased and inconsistent(Hausman and Taylor 1981). In column (2) ‘‘within’’ estimates are displayed. Thelarge discrepancies between the two sets of estimates indicate a problem withcorrelation between a and the explanatory variables. In column (3) GLS estimatesare shown. A Hausman speciﬁcation test (Hausman 1978) based on a model (ﬁxedeffect and random component) with homoscedacity and no serial correlation has av2-value of 15.29. With 6 degrees of freedom the p-value is 0.018 thus indicating aproblem with correlation between a and the explanatory variables. Accordingly, themodels (1) and (3) can not serve as reference for inference concerning effects of theexplanatory variables.Since model (2) does not permit time-invariant explanatory variables, weestimate an ‘‘augmented’’ regression model (4)yit ¼ X1itb1 þ X2ib2 þ mi þ X1ic þ eitwhere X1i is a row vector of averages with respect to time of the time-dependentexplanatory variables (Frees 2001, 2004, see also Arellano 1993). One may interpretthis model as a model that speciﬁes the dependency of a on the time-dependentvariables as ai ¼ X1ic þ mi. (See also Hsiao 2003). Using GLS estimation in thismodel results in estimators that are robust to time constant omitted variables bias(Frees 2004). Testing the hypothesis c = 0 is an alternative to the Hausman123480L.

Jensen, T. Lüthjespeciﬁcation test. Furthermore, since we use robust standard errors in the estimationof c, this test is more robust to violation of model assumptions (homoscedasticityand no serial correlation). Clearly, from Table 3 the c-vector can not be assumed tobe the zero vector. We further note that the ‘‘within’’ estimate and the ‘‘augmented’’estimate of the vector b1 are equal (Frees 2001, 2004). Some minor discrepancies inTable 3 are due to the estimation routine.Judged from model (4) in Table 3, DISTANCE has a negative effect on VIIT.Thus hypothesis H4 is supported by the data. As regards the effect of ASP andINCO on VIIT, the signs of the coefﬁcients are as expected and also signiﬁcant inthese models and thereby offering support for hypothesis H1 and H3. The effect ofAGDPC on VIIT is also signiﬁcant and positive. On the one hand, AGDPC interactssigniﬁcantly with our measure of income distribution overlap, INCO. The negativeinteraction implies that the positive effect on VIIT of a larger income distributionoverlap between a country pair levels off when average income of the country pairincreases. On the other hand, the positive effect of AGDPC decreases with largerincome distribution overlap. In fact, since the regression coefﬁcients for AGDPCand the interaction between INCO and AGDPC are of the same size but of adifferent sign, a maximum value of INCO (=1) implies no effect of AGDPC. Asregards the effects of differences in factor endowments these are positive except theeffect of DPKL but not signiﬁcant. The results of models (2) and (4) indicate thatdifferences in factor endowments have a minor inﬂuence on VIIT.In order to further investigate the effects of differences in factor endowments weset up a model allowing for serial correlation (AR (1)) and variable slopes (randomcoefﬁcients) as regards DTKL and DPKL. The random slopes can be expressed asb ? di with b as the ﬁxed part and di as a random component with mean zero. Thusb is the average slope and di is the difference between the average slope andthe slope for country pair i. None of the variance components are signiﬁcant (resultsnot shown). Hence we do not ﬁnd support for hypothesis H2, i.e. the effect ofdifferences in factor endowments on VIIT does not depend on trade partners.Model (5) takes account of serial correlation and reveals practical identical resultsas model (4).In Table 3, some ﬁt-measures are supplied in order to choose the ‘‘best’’ modelfor inference. R2 is a pseudo coefﬁcient of determination, calculated as the squaredcorrelation between the dependent variable y and the estimated values of y based onﬁxed (non-random) effects. Since the country pair level in model (2) is included, thevalue of R2 is very high but at the expense of many parameters. Without the countrypair level the value is 0.026. This shows that the included time-dependentexplanatory variables have only a small effect on VIIT. As a ﬁt measure that alsotakes into account the number of parameters of the ﬁtted model is Baysianinformation criterion (BIC), calculated asBIC ¼2 log likelihood þ number of parameters logðN*Þwhere N* is the number of subjects or country pairs (=153). A smaller valueindicates a better and more parsimonious model. In this sense, model (5) in Table 3is the best model among the relevant models (2), (4) and (5) indicating thatinference concerning effects should be performed in model (5).123Driving forces of vertical intra-industry trade in Europe 1996–2005483In order to investigate the robustness of the conclusions to different choices ofdispersion factor, results for d = 25% are shown in Table 4. The conclusionsregarding the effect of the explanatory variables are the same as with d = 15%.7 ConclusionsUsing panel data methods, we conducted an econometric analysis of intra-industrytrade with vertically differentiated products among the EU-15 countries and fourEast European countries: Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic. Weinvestigated the effect of differences in factor endowments and other determinantsthat emerge from theory: income distribution overlap, average income, share of thetotal industrial production and geographical proximity.We ﬁnd that differences in factor endowments seem not to be important as adriving force behind VIIT for European countries in the period 1996–2005. Moreimportant driving forces are production size, geographical proximity, averageincome per capita and income distribution overlap. Countries characterized by beingon a high economic level and by being large economies have a higher bilateral VIITwith each other than with other countries. Furthermore, countries with large incomedistribution overlap tend to have a large VIIT. Finally, countries far from each otherhave lower VIIT than countries close to each other.AcknowledgmentsWe acknowledge helpful suggestions and comments by the anonymous reviewer.AppendixSee Tables 5 and 6.29 Organic chemicals30 Pharmaceutical products31 FertilizersTable 5 Manufactured goods at a 2-digit product level28 Inorgn chem; compds of prec met, radioact elements etc32 Tanning/dyeing extract; tannins and derivs; pigm etc33 Essential oils and resinoids; perf, cosmetic/toilet prep34 Soap, organic surface-active agents, washing prep, etc35 Albuminoidal subs; modiﬁed starches; glues; enzymes36 Explosives; pyrotechnic prod; matches; pyrop alloy; etc37 Photographic or cinematographic goods63 Other made up textile articles;sets; worn clothing etc64 Footwear, gaiters and the like;parts of such articles65 Headgear and parts thereof66 Umbrellas, walking-sticks, seat-sticks, whips, etc67 Prepr feathers and down; artiﬂower; articles human hair68 Art of stone, plaster, cement,asbestos, mica/sim mat69 Ceramic products70 Glass and glassware71 Natural/cultured pearls, precstones and metals, coin etc72 Iron and steel123484Table 5 continued38 Miscellaneous chemical products39 Plastics and articles thereof40 Rubber and articles thereof41 Raw hides and skins (other than furskins) andleather42 Articles of leather; saddlery/harness; travelgoods etc43 Furskins and artiﬁcial fur; manufactures thereof 79 Zinc and articles thereof44 Wood and articles of wood; wood charcoal80 Tin and articles thereof45 Cork and articles of cork46 Manufactures of straw, esparto/other plaitingmat; etc47 Pulp of wood/of other ﬁbrous cellulosic mat;waste etc81 Other base metals; cermets; articles thereof82 Tool, implement, cutlery, spoon and fork, ofbase met etc83 Miscellaneous articles of base metal48 Paper and paperboard; art of paper pulp, paper/ 84 Nuclear reactors, boilers, mchy and mechpaperboard appliance; parts49 Printed books, newspapers, pictures and otherproduct etc85 Electrical mchy equip parts thereof; soundrecorder etcL.
