Social Compensation: Factor Social-ComparisonArtifact?Andrew R. ToddNorthwestern UniversityDong-Heon Seok, Norbert L. Kerr and Lawrence A. MesséMichigan State UniversityGroup Processes &Intergroup Relations2006 Vol 9(3) 431–442GPIRThe use of coactors as non-group controls in prior social compensation research has left openthe possibility that the effect might artifactually have resulted from a confound between workcondition (Coaction vs. Collective) and the opportunity to make performance comparisons. Adirect empirical test of this alternative, artifactual explanation is reported. Its results contradictthat explanation and suggest that the use of coactors as controls has, if anything, resulted in anunderestimation of the magnitude of the social compensation effect. It is argued that multiplealternative non-group performance baselines can be informative for analyzing group motivationeffects.keywords group performance, motivation gains, social compensation, socialloaﬁngOVER the past 25 years there have been manyempirical demonstrations of motivation lossesor social loaﬁng in small performance groups(see Karau & Williams, 1993; Shepperd, 1993,for reviews). However, in the last decade or so,a handful of studies (e.g. Erev, Bornstein, &Galili, 1993; Hertel, Kerr, & Messè, 2000;Kerr & MacCoun, 1984; Stroebe, Diehl, &Abakoumkin, 1996) have documented groupmotivation gain phenomena—that is, higher taskmotivation within a group performance contextthan within a comparable individual perform-ance context. While empirical demonstrationsof motivation gains are rather rare (Hertelet al., 2000), the social compensation effect is anoteworthy example of one of the earliest andmost thoroughly studied of such phenomena(e.g. Williams & Karau, 1991; Karau & Williams,1997; Hart, Bridgett, & Karau, 2001).Social compensation occurs when ‘. . . indi-viduals increase their efforts on collective tasksto compensate for the anticipated poor per-formance of other group members’ (Karau &Williams, 1997, p. 158). In the generic socialcompensation study, subjects work at a simple,effort-sensitive task1 (e.g. writing down as manyuses for a common object as possible) either ina coacting pair (who are not interdependentAuthor’s noteAddress correspondence to Andrew R.

The group task is (a) additive(i.e. the group score is the simple sum of thegroup members’ individual—but supposedlyunidentiﬁable—scores; Steiner, 1972) and (b)information reducing (i.e. it is not possible toidentify the individual group members’ contri-butions from the group performance; Davis,1969). These are precisely the conditions underwhich early social loaﬁng research (e.g. Latané,Williams, & Harkins, 1979) had found andwould predict less effort in the collective con-dition. And indeed, when one receives pre-performance information suggesting that one’spartner is quite capable at the task (e.g. willexert a high level of effort (Williams & Karau,1991, Experiment 2), or has high task ability(Williams & Karau, 1991, Experiment 3)), thisis exactly what is observed (see the left sides ofFigure 1a and 1b, which reproduce the resultsof two of Williams & Karau’s early social com-pensation studies). However, when feedbacksuggests that one’s partner is very incapable, arather different pattern obtains (see the rightsides of Figure 1a and 1b). In the collective con-dition, a good group performance can only beachieved if one works extra hard to compensatefor the anticipated poor performance by one’steammate; it is under these conditions that thesocial loaﬁng effect is reversed and the socialcompensation effect is observed.This basic pattern has been replicated severaltimes (e.g. Karau & Williams, 1997; Hart et al.,2001) and appears to be robust. However, thedesign of these studies introduced a potentialconfound that raises an alternative, artifactualexplanation for this social compensation effect.The collective versus coactive contrast isintended to—and indeed does—compare aparticular type of group performance (viz. per-formers are interdependent and the nature ofthat interdependence permits one groupmember to compensate through his/her effortsfor an expected incapacity of a teammate) witha corresponding individual performance (viz.performers are independent and cannot affectone another’s score or outcome through their432own level of performance). A coaction controlcondition has typically been used (rather thana lone individual performer) to control fornuisance factors like modeling, distraction, andmere presence of another performer. Unfortu-nately, the coaction control condition alsoallows the possibility of a direct, immediate, andpublic comparison of scores with another per-former, whereas the information-reducingaspect of the group task makes such an inter-personal comparison unfeasible. In fact, notonly is such comparison possible in the coactivecondition, instructions that are delivered to thetwo coactors prior to the task suggest that suchcomparison is certain (‘The experimenter alsotold the participants that he would count uptheir individual scores . . . at the end of thesession and tell them how many uses they hadproduced’, p. 574, Williams & Karau, 1991).Such opportunities for a direct and immediatecomparison could well lead to one using theanticipated output of the coactor as a basis forchoosing one’s own level of effort—a type of‘production matching’ with an implicit per-formance standard (cf. Stroebe et al., 1996).In sum, the social compensation effect couldbe due: (a) to the imperative of compensatingfor an incapable partner in the collective con-dition (the usual interpretation); and/or (b) todemotivating effects of public comparison withan incapable other in the coaction condition(an alternative, artifactual interpretation, whichwe will term the social-comparison explanation).The latter possibility is not theoretically far-fetched; if one believes that the one person withwhom s/he will soon be publicly compared isnot very capable, one may feel that less effort isrequired to insure a favorable comparison. Inaddition, the expectation that one’s own per-formance will probably surpass that of readilyavailable comparison others could well bedemotivating by reducing opportunities forboth meaningful self-evaluation and favorableexternal evaluation (cf. Harkins, 2001). Consist-ent with such speculation, empirical demon-strations of the social compensation effect havenot been characterized by a dramatic rise ineffort when social compensation is needed (i.e.in the incapable partner/collective condition),(a) Experiment 2(b) Experiment 33530saedIfo25rebmuN20153530fo25saedIrebmuN2015Todd et al. social compensationCoactiveCollectiveHigh EffortLow EffortPartner EffortCoactiveCollectiveHigh AbilityLow AbilityPartner AbilityFigure 1. Results of Williams & Karau (1991), Experiments 2 & 3.433Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 9(3)but as the social-comparison explanationimplies, rather by a dramatic drop in effort inthe coaction control condition (see Figure 1).2One counterargument to the artifactualexplanation is that a similar pattern of resultshas been found (Williams & Karau, 1991,Experiment 1) when the subject received nodirect feedback indicating that his/her partnerwas incapable, but instead was chronically mis-trustful of others (and thus, to ‘. . . expectothers to loaf’). Speciﬁcally, those medium andhigh in level of trust showed a social loaﬁngeffect (i.e. coactive > collective), whereas thoselow in trust showed the opposite, social com-pensation effect (i.e. collective > coactive). Itmight be argued that absent direct feedbackthat one’s partner was incapable, the purporteddemotivating effect of being compared withhim/her should not occur. But these data areinconclusive. First, mistrustfulness could breedlowered expectation of the other’s likely per-formance not just when the other is a teammatebut also when s/he is a coactor. Expectations ofthe other’s performance were collected, butanalyzed in such a way that it is unclear whetheror not expectations were equally low for mis-trustful participants in both the collective andcoaction conditions. Second, unlike the othersocial compensation studies, the key moderatorhere is a personality (rather than a situational)factor, and thus, other relevant individualdifferences could have been confounds (e.g. iflow trusters are also relatively more concernedabout a possibly invidious comparison). Thus,although these data are not irrelevant to theartifactual explanation, they do not rule it out.The purpose of this brief paper is to report anempirical examination of the artifactual social-comparison explanation. We sought to (a) repli-cate the usual social compensation effect (i.e.with a coaction control), and then (b) includeanother isolated-individual-performer controlcondition in which direct and immediate socialcomparison with an incapable coactor was notpossible. The various nuisance effects thatcoaction has been designed to control (e.g. dis-traction, modeling, mere presence) were con-trolled in all conditions here by preventingparticipants from seeing one another or their434work products during the experiment.3 Ofspecial interest are two possibilities: (1) that thepattern of results is the same with an individualcontrol as with coactor controls, which wouldcontradict the artifactual explanation; and (2)that the social compensation effect is eliminatedwhen one uses an individual control, ﬁndingsthat would suggest the effect is entirely due tothe artifactual explanation. Of course, otherpatterns are also possible and of interest (e.g.the social compensation effect is attenuated butnot eliminated with the individual control, sug-gesting that the artifact contributes to but doesnot wholly account for the effect; the social com-pensation effect is even stronger with individualcontrols, suggesting that the opportunity forsocial comparison—even with a very incapablepartner—is motivating and hence, that the useof coactor controls actually underestimates themagnitude of the social compensation effect).To the degree that the artifactual social-com-parison explanation is supported, the attribu-tion veracity of the observed effect being due toa motivation gain would be undermined. As aresult, we would be forced to conclude thatgroup motivation gain effects are even rarerthan previously thought.MethodParticipants and designThe participants (Ps) were 167 female under-graduate students from introductory psychol-ogy courses who received course credit for theirparticipation. (Note that previous studies, e.g.Williams & Karau, 1991 and Hart et al., 2001,report no moderation of the social compen-sation effect by sex of participant.) The designwas a 2 (Partner capability: High vs. Low) 3(Work condition: Collective vs. Coactive vs.Individual) between-Ps factorial.Task and procedureThe task was the same idea generation exercisethat most previous social compensationresearch has used. Ps were asked to generate asmany uses for a common object (viz. knife) asthey could in a 12-minute period. Instructions(taken nearly verbatim from Williams et al.,1991) stressed quantity, not quality or creativityof uses. In order to maximize the importance ormeaningfulness of the task, participants weretold that research suggested that performanceon the use-generating task is highly correlatedwith intelligence and achievement; it has beenshown (Williams & Karau, 1991, Experiment 3)that social compensation requires a task forwhich good performance is important (other-wise, why bother to compensate for anincapable partner?). As they performed, Ps satopposite each other at computer tables with asight-blocking partition between them. In theCoaction and Individual conditions, there was abox on each table into which the uses wereplaced (one per slip of paper). In the Collectivecondition, there was a single, common boxinside the double-walled partition which caughtthe slips of paper that both dyad memberspushed through slits in the partition walls.These slits were so located that neither dyadmember could see when a slip was beingpushed through by her teammate or how manyslips there were in the box. To further eliminatepotential distraction, modeling, or merepresence effects, Ps wore headphones playingmusic as they performed the task.Most Ps were scheduled in pairs and whenboth showed up, either a Collective or Coactivecondition—randomly determined—was run.When only one P signed or showed up, a femaleconfederate took on the partner role. Thus, allsessions began with two partners present—either two actual Ps or one P plus a confeder-ate. As will become clear below, Ps in theIndividual condition always had the confeder-ate as a partner.The procedure used in this experiment was avariation on the procedures used by Karau &Williams (Experiment 2, 1997) and Hart et al.(2001). Upon arrival, both the participants (orthe actual P and the confederate, if applicable)were led to one of two computer tables in thelaboratory. Each of the computer tables wasequipped with a computer, a stack of exactlyﬁfty blank slips of paper, a pen, and a pair ofheadphones.After signing a consent form, Ps received adescription of the uses-generation task. In theTodd et al. social compensationCoaction and Individual conditions, the exper-imenter explained that she was interested intheir individual performances, not their collec-tive performance. In the Collective condition,the Ps were told that they comprised a two-person group and that the experimenter wasonly interested in the total number of usesgenerated collectively by the group and not inindividual performances. The experimenteralso demonstrated how the single collectionbox worked and, in doing so, stressed theanonymity of individual contributions (e.g.noted that the dyad members would use penswith the same color ink).Participants were then told that one purposeof the experiment was to examine the effects ofstandardized communication strategies on indi-vidual and group task performance. Purport-edly employees in large corporations had beenusing banks of prewritten messages in order tosimplify email communication, and we wereinterested in investigating the effect of thisform of standardized communication onemployee performance and satisfaction. Pswere to choose one message from each ofthree banks of standardized messages (threemessages total) that would be sent to theircoworker via computer. The first bankexpressed Ps’ interest in the task (seven alterna-tive messages whose content communicateddiffering levels of task interest, ranging fromvery high to very low). The second bankexpressed Ps’ expected level of effort on thecoming task. The third bank expressed Ps’ self-perceived ability at the coming task. Afterchoosing one message from each bank, Psclicked a button to send their message set totheir partner (in fact, these messages werenever sent). Ps then shortly after received threemessages, allegedly from their partner. In allconditions, the partner’s first messageexpressed a high interest in the task. Theremaining two messages manipulated thepartner’s task capability. In the High capabilitycondition, the messages were ‘My effort on thistask will be extremely high’ and ‘My ability onthis task is extremely high’. In the Low capabil-ity condition, the messages were ‘My effort onthis task will be extremely low’ and ‘My ability435Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 9(3)on this task is extremely low’.4 While themessage-exchanging portion of the experimentwas taking place, the experimenter left theroom; moreover, after reading the messagesreceived, Ps clicked a button that allegedly per-manently erased the messages. This was done toensure that Ps believed that the experimenterwould not be able to ascertain either a P’s pro-fessed level of motivation or their ability toperform the task.5After a short interval which gave Ps theopportunity to read the messages sent by theirpartner, the experimenter re-entered the lab.In the Individual condition only, the experi-menter asked the confederate whether she was,as she had indicated on her consent form,under 18 years of age. The confederate said shewas. The experimenter explained that shecould not participate without parental consentand that she would have to obtain such consentbefore she could be rescheduled. For thisreason, she was excused from the experimentand left the lab. Note that this procedureinsured that the true P in the Individual con-dition always had the knowledge that anotherostensibly random participant was either veryhigh or very low in task capability (as in theother two work conditions), but it removed theopportunity for a direct, immediate, and publicperformance comparison with that participantat the conclusion of the task. (Of course, intheory, the experimenter could later comparean Individual P’s performance with that ofother participants, but there was no possibilityin this condition of immanent comparisonwhich we assume to be the P’s concern in oursocial-comparison alternative to the usual socialcompensation explanation.)At this point the participant(s) were directedto put on their headphones and to follow therest of the instructions contained on the tape.The experimenter again left the room. Theinstructions on the tape, which described thespeciﬁc object (i.e. a knife) for which they wereto generate as many uses as they could, werefollowed by 12 minutes of music, during whichthe participants worked at the task—thinking ofuses for the target object, writing their answeron slips of paper, folding the slips and placing436them in their collection box(es). The experi-menter monitored the time using a stopwatch.At the end of the work period, Ps were given apost-experimental questionnaire that con-tained manipulation checks and checks ofsuspicion. Finally, Ps were debriefed, thanked,and dismissed.ResultsManipulation checksP’s were asked to assess on 7-point rating scaleshow much effort the partner was willing to exertat the task and how much ability she had. As onewould expect, the partner in the Low capabilityconditions was seen both as willing to exert lesseffort (M = 3.92) and having less ability (M =4.22) than the partner in the High capabilitycondition (effort M = 6.31, t(152) = 8.36, p <.001, d = 1.36; ability M = 5.65, t(152) = 5.79, p <.001, d = .94); reduced degrees of freedomreﬂect missing data due to failures to completethe questionnaire). Hence, the manipulation ofpartner capability was successful.Analyses of performanceReplication of the social compensation effect?The ﬁrst question we examined was whether wereplicated the basic social compensation effectunder the typical conditions (viz. with coactorsas controls). In all conditions, the ideas gener-ated were counted by subtracting the numberof unused slips from 50 (all Ps were given 50slips of paper before beginning the idea-generation task). The key contrast tests aninteraction effect—is the usual social loaﬁngeffect observed when one believes that one hasa very capable partner (i.e. Collective <Coactive) reversed when one believes that onehas a very incapable partner (i.e. Coactive <Collective)? A test of this contrast was statisti-cally signiﬁcant (F(1,161) = 4.02, p < .05, d =.32), and as one can see in Figure 2 (white andblack bars), the same pattern is observed as inthe usual social compensation study (see Figure1). In the present study, the social loaﬁng effect(High capability partner) was significant(t(161) = 1.96, p = .05, d = .31), whereas thesocial compensation contrast (Low capabilityTodd et al. social compensationCoactiveCollectiveIndividual3530.saedIfo25rebmuN2015High CapabilityLow CapabilityOthers’ CapabilityFigure 2.

It is atleast possible, though, that ceiling effects mayhave prevented such an effect from emerginghere.DiscussionThe use of coaction controls in prior social com-pensation research has left open the possibilitythat the effect might artifactually have resultedfrom a confound between work condition(Coaction vs. Collective) and the opportunity tomake performance comparisons. If makingsuch a comparison with a very incapable otherwere demotivating, then it could have been thecase that the social compensation effect hadlittle or nothing to do with the need to compen-sate for an incapable partner, but stemmedinstead from such a social comparison process.In the present study, we directly tested thisalternative, artifactual explanation for the socialcompensation effect. Our data strongly contra-dict it. Removing the opportunity for immediatepublic comparison with an incapable other didnot, as this explanation would predict, increaseeffort, but actually tended (nonsigniﬁcantly) todecrease effort. It appears that the opportunityfor comparison is (if anything) motivating, evenwhen the person with whom one will compare isvery likely to perform poorly. Thus, far frombeing the source of an artifactual explanation,the use of the coaction control in prior socialcompensation has tended to work againstdemonstrating the effect, and to underestimat-ing its strength.These findings have several useful impli-cations. First, and most obviously, they bolsterthe validity of the original interpretation of thebest documented of the few extant group moti-vation gain effects, the social compensationeffect. That interpretation suggested that theobserved motivation gain was attributable to aparticular pattern of outcome interpendence—where one’s prospects of obtaining a highly438valued outcome (e.g. a group success)depended upon compensating for the per-ceived incapacities of other group members byworking extra hard. However, quite apart fromthe alternative social-comparison explanationexamined here, there were theoretical andempirical reasons to doubt that interpretation.For example, when the rewards of groupsuccess are shared equally by all groupmembers (as they were here and in prior socialcompensation research), socially compensatingfor others can result in doing more than anequal or fair share of the group’s work. Such aninequitable arrangement has been shown tolead to motivation losses under some con-ditions—at times, group members will reducetheir own efforts (and consequently, thechances of group success) rather than do morethan what they see as a fair share of the group’swork. Williams and Karau (1991) suggest thatthis aversion to ‘playing the sucker’ can beovercome if one places a sufﬁciently high valueon group success; they even demonstrate (intheir Experiment 3) that the social compen-sation effect is eliminated if the group’s task isseen as unimportant to its members. By discon-ﬁrming a plausible alternative to the social com-pensation explanation, our results lendcredibility to their suggestion. Apparently,group members who are exerting supernormallevels of effort will put up with doing aninequitable share of the group’s work if groupsuccess is sufﬁciently valued.Our study also touches on a fundamentalissue in the study of group motivation—what isthe proper non-group baseline against which todetect group motivation gains or losses? Some(e.g. Karau & Williams, 1993; Williams & Karau,1991) have argued that coactors provide themost appropriate baseline. Others (e.g. Kerr,1983; Markus, 2001) have argued that isolatedindividuals represent better baselines. As thepresent paper suggests, this controversy is par-tially a matter of how best to avoid uninterest-ing confounds (e.g. to control for ‘merepresence’ effects when probing for group moti-vation gains or losses). But it is also a matter ofa fundamental conceptual issue—viz. ‘what isand is not a group’? There is no universallyagreed upon answer to this question; however,many if not most scholars include shared goalsand some degree of mutual interdependence asnecessary properties of a group, especially aperformance group (cf. Forsyth, 1999). Ourown preference for isolated individuals as thebest non-group baseline stems from the factthat many typical elements of the coactionsetting (such as the mere presence of others,the possibility of distraction, the possibility ofattentional conﬂict, the opportunity to observeothers perform, the opportunity to comparelevels of performance), while commonelements of performance groups, are notdefining necessary conditions. Thus, motiva-tional gains or losses which ultimately stemfrom such elements could well be viewed as notbeing essentially group phenomena, butinstead being phenomena that can arise incertain group settings but not others. On theother hand, one could argue (as Latané et al.,1979, did implicitly in their seminal socialloafing paper) that if certain elements (e.g.individual member contributions beingunidentifiable from a group product) areroutine features of many performance groups,then the motivational effects of those elementscould fairly be classiﬁed as group effects (evenif those same elements are not necessary for allor even most performance groups).Clearly, this is partially a semantic issue, but itis more than that. The answer to many import-ant questions—e.g. is a particular effect agenuine group motivation loss or gain? whereshould one look for such effects? when it comesto application, are groups or teams superior orinferior to individuals as performers?—ulti-mately depends on just what processes weclassify as group processes. And whenever indi-vidual performance differs in individual andcoactive performance settings, the answers wecome up with depend on just which baseline wechoose. Consider, for example, the following:• Another recently documented (purported)group motivation gain is the Köhler motiva-tion gain effect (Hertel et al., 2000). Here, itis the least capable group member who mustwork extra hard because the task demandsTodd et al. social compensationare conjunctive (Steiner, 1972)—i.e. thegroup’s performance depends on the leastcapable member’s performance. Theoriginal (Köhler, 1926) and subsequent(Hertel et al., 2000; Messé, Hertel, Kerr,Lount, & Park, 2002; Stroebe et al., 1996)empirical demonstrations of the effect haveall used isolated individual performers astheir non-group baselines. But some of theproposed explanations of this effect do notrequire what we have advanced as conditionsnecessary for groups. For example, Stroebeet al.’s (1996) goal setting explanation onlyrequires the availability of a more capableperformer, not the existence of a morecapable group member working toward acommon goal with some interdependence(e.g. a conjunctive group task). If suchexplanations are valid, then we might expectthe Köhler effect to occur in a number ofcoaction settings. Although an initial attemptto test this possibility offered little support tothe goal setting explanation (see Hertelet al., 2000, Experiment 2), subsequent testssuggest that it does provide a partial expla-nation of the effect (Kerr, Seok, Poulsen,Harris, & Messé, 2006). The important pointis that we could have come to different con-clusions about whether the Köhler effect wasa genuine group motivation gain, how largeit was, and why it occurred had we chosenisolated individuals or coactors as ourbaseline of non-group performance.• Members of mixed-sex dyads have beenshown to work harder than either membersof same-sex dyads or isolated individualcontrols, an effect that has been interpretedas a group motivation gain (Kerr & Sullaway,1983; Kerr & MacCoun, 1984). But if thiseffect is the result of concerns about violat-ing traditional sex role expectations, then itmay not require collaborative groupaction—mixed-sex sets of coactors couldshow a similar effect.• Other work has shown that members ofgroups who can engage in intra- (Stroebeet al., 1996) or intergroup (Erev et al., 1993;Worchel, Rothgerber, Day, Hart, & Bute-meyer, 1998) competition work harder than439Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 9(3)•individual controls. But certain explanationsof this effect suggest that coaction settingswhich offer similar opportunities for compe-tition might produce quite similar effects.Markus (2001) has shown that some socialloaﬁng effects might be attributable to thedifferential effects of individual vs. coactionwork conditions on intrinsic task motivation.We suspect that such issues cannot andshould not be resolved by fiat—by simplydeclaring one particular non-group baseline asthe ‘gold standard’ for group motivationeffects. Rather, we would like to suggest that thetwo most popular non-group baselines—isolated individuals and coacting individuals—both provide informative baselines foranalyzing psychological processes of relevanceto how hard people work in groups. In thepresent study we were able to narrow the rangeof plausible explanations for the social compen-sation effect by including both baselines.Future work on group motivation could andshould be likewise enriched by includingmultiple baselines. And even when this is notpossible, scholars would be well advised toconsider the theoretical implications of exam-ining alternatives to the baselines they doemploy.Notes1. By effort-sensitive, we mean a task for whichperformance is entirely or almost entirely afunction of effort (rather than other factors, likeability, insight, luck, etc.) and for which there is amonotonic relationship between performanceand effort.2. It must be conceded that the pattern in thesedata—a relatively low level of performance of thecoactor-low capability partner, compared tocoactor-high capability partner—could resultfrom processes other than the social comparisonexplanation proposed here. For example, it isconceivable that one tends to match a coworker’sexpected level of performance, regardless ofwhether performance levels will subsequently becompared. This would result in generally lowerperformance in the low partner capabilityconditions (which could then be further440moderated by a social compensation effect,resulting in a relatively higher level ofperformance in the collective-incapable partnercondition). Thus, we agree with Williams andKarau’s suggestion that the result of primaryinterest is a particular interaction effect, viz. thereversal—when one has an incapable partner—ofthe usual social loaﬁng effect (observed herewhen one has a capable partner, or as in thetypical social loaﬁng study, when one knowsnothing about others’ capabilities).3. It should also be noted that the use of a coactioncontrol condition is not always simply a matter ofcontrolling nuisance variables. A number of testsof substantive theories of social facilitation andsocial loaﬁng have suggested that working aloneis psychologically different than workingalongside others (e.g. Cottrell, 1972; Harkins,1987, 2001; Sanna, 1992).4. Note that we jointly varied ability and motivationfeedback to create the High and Lowpartner-capability conditions. In an experimentwhich orthogonally manipulated ability andmotivation feedback, Hart et al., (2001) foundthat the standard social compensation effect onlyoccurred when both were low. This suggests thatin earlier studies (e.g. Williams & Karau, 1991)where only one of these two bases for capabilityhad been manipulated, Ps presumed that theother varied in kind (e.g. a poorly motivatedpartner was also likely to have low ability).5. Another possible boundary condition on socialcompensation is that those who evaluate grouptask performance (e.g. a supervisor; theexperimenter) should not know that there is anincapable member in the group. Otherwise, suchan evaluator might attribute a poor groupperformance not to the team as a whole(including the more capable member) but just tothe incapable member’s probable poorperformance. The more capable member shouldnot be as likely to try to compensate under suchconditions.6. We have also argued (see Note 2) that neither thesigniﬁcance of the simple partner-capability maineffects nor or their relative (absolute) magnitudesare of special interest here. However, for theinterested reader, the simple partner-capabilitymain effect under coactive conditions was notsigniﬁcant (t(161) = .73, ns), while thecorresponding simple main effect undercollective conditions was (t(161) = –2.01, p < .05,d = .32).AcknowledgmentsLawrence A.
