DEBATE279Notes1 The argument also seems to be counter-intuitive on ‘contextualist’ grounds them-selves. The appeal to maximizing overall outcomes complicates any justiﬁcationfor the special protection of minorities, because, presumably, minority interestsare (quantitatively) outweighed by those of the majority on any given issue.ReferencesCarens, J.

My article was a step towards addressing this complex issue. I amgrateful therefore to my discussants for their thoughtful comments on myarticle.Before I respond to what I take to be their major criticisms, let mecorrect a factual misunderstanding. The Netherlands does not have, asMiriam Ticktin thinks, a policy of free access to pre-natal diagnostics(PND), nor am I arguing that it should have.Ticktin claims that I am taking a culturalistic perspective that wouldprevent me from seeing what is really at stake. SSA is a practice that,according to her, is shaped by state violence against and discrimination of280ETHNICITIES 5(2)immigrant minority groups. I have no problem in acknowledging that theNetherlands’ policy towards immigrant groups is harsh and that the racistprejudice the Dutch display against immigrants is alarming. Yet they do notconstitute the cause of SSA. At the root of the problem is a cultural sonpreference and we should be prepared to acknowledge this.This sex preference is linked to the tradition of providing a daughter witha dowry when she marries. In my article, I explained that, due to a processof commodiﬁcation of the tradition, some families now demand very expen-sive consumer goods for a dowry gift and therefore a daughter’s marriagemay economically ruin a family. This is an important background to this sexpreference. I think, therefore, that I deploy a more materialist notion ofculture than Ticktin thinks.Monica Mookherjee believes that I leave women in the cold who arepressurized into ‘choosing’ SSA, because I do not pay enough attention to thesocial conditions under which these women make their choice. According toher I herewith display a non-relational view on autonomy that sees all of usas equally free to determine our lives, while Ticktin suggests that I see westernwomen as fully autonomous and the rest of us as non-autonomous victims ofour culture. I agree that I did not discuss at length how Asian women’sautonomy can be enhanced, as my focus was on whether measures to banSSA should include restricting access to abortion. I consider both Dutch andAsian women as capable of autonomy, yet both as also constrained inexercising their autonomy, albeit by different social and cultural conditions.Making the abortion law more restrictive does not lift these constraints.Social policy may, however, and therefore this is what I see as a better wayto offer protection to women who are pressurized to undergo a SSA.Anne Phillips’s main worry, which she shares with Monica Mookherjee,is that my contextualism will end in pure pragmatism. Phillips expresses theclassical philosophical preference: ﬁrst we determine whether a practice ismorally right or wrong (the philosopher’s job), and once we know whatjustice requires, the policymaker decides on the implementation of actualpolicy. The actual policy-outcome may be co-determined by pragmaticconcerns, but these fall outside the philosophical analysis. I do not believein this neat job delineation, moreover, I think that what to do as a matterof policy is a question that normally also involves moral considerations.To illustrate my point let me bring forward Stephen Macedo’s discussionof the Mozert and the Yoder cases. In Mozert v. Hawkins, a conﬂict overpublic education and religious diversity, orthodox Christian parentsobjected to the school’s mandatory basic reading program that exposedtheir children to a variety of worldviews. The parents claimed a right toexempt their children from the reading program, while remaining in thepublic schools (Macedo, 1995: 472). Macedo decided that on principledgrounds the Mozert families should not be accommodated. He added to thisthat there are also prudential reasons that might be considered – schoolDEBATE281administrators might anticipate that the families would otherwise withdrawtheir children altogether from the public school system and for that reasonaccommodate them – but these come secondary, and he even doubtedwhether courts should at all examine these ‘additional grounds’, as he calledthem (1995: 487, 488). Hence, Macedo distinguished between principle-based and pragmatic arguments while arguing that we should take intoaccount the former only. Yet, note that Macedo, whilst against accommo-dating the Mozert parents, thought it right to accommodate the moreradical claim of Amish’ parents (the Yoder case) to altogether withdrawtheir school-aged children from high school, since the Amish, because oftheir small number, pose no threat to public order (1995: 472, 489). Hence,it was ultimately a pragmatic argument about numbers (sic!) that settled forMacedo whether to accommodate or not. Contextual arguments inter-penetrate with principled arguments. In a contextual approach, this isacknowledged and considered as inescapable. Principles are generic and assuch underdetermined. To make sense of them and to be able to make ajudgement in speciﬁc cases we need contexts.This being said, I do share Phillips’s worry that there is the risk to Carens’s– and as I follow his approach (Carens, 2000), also my – contextualism thatwe end up with a kind of ‘moral casuistry’, as Seyla Benhabib so aptly phrasesit (2002: 125). By this she means the risk that we confuse ‘the normativelyright’ with ‘the institutionally feasible’ (2002: 125). The problem withCarens’s contextual approach is that pragmatic arguments may co-determineour moral deliberation, yet it remains unclear to what extent. I thinkBenhabib touches the sore spot in Carens’s approach, yet I do not see a readysolution. New rules of lexical priority? Which ones? Besides, they seem togo against the grain of the approach. In the meantime, unsatisfactory as itmay seem, we have no choice but to contextually argue it out.References<ref>Benhabib, S.
