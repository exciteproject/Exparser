Three factors were derived from malestudent scores on the Mirels–Garrett Protestant Work Ethic Scale, Ho’s Australian Work EthicScale and a scale designed to assess preferences for reward distributions: instrumental value ofwork, ethical value of work and normative value of equity. The study assessed motivation loss intwo situations; one designed to promote free-rider effects and another designed to promotesucker effects. Results showed that the sucker effect was moderated by all three factors but inqualitatively different ways whereas the free rider effect was not strongly moderated by any ofthe PWE factors.keywordsgroup productivity, motivation losses, Protestant Work EthicMany important tasks cannot be completed bysingle individuals, but can only be accomplishedby groups. Many tasks in organizations requiremembers of teams to pool their individual con-tributions in order to reach the group goal (e.g.Antoni, 1994). However, teamwork does notalways work out as intended. In some instances,the group product is satisfying; in other instances,the group is far from achieving their productivepotential.The failure of groups to realize their poten-tial group productivity has been thoroughlyinvestigated and is a well established ﬁnding.Decreased productivity can be the result of co-ordination losses, but it is also a result of effortreduction stemming from motivation lossesAuthor’s noteAddress correspondence to Susanne Abele,Miami University, Department of Psychology,100 Psychology Building, 90 N PattersonAve, Oxford, Ohio, 45056, USA [email:abeles@muohio.edu]Copyright © 2008 SAGE Publications(Los Angeles, London, New Delhi and Singapore)11:1; 39–54; DOI: 10.1177/1368430207084845Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 11(1)(Latane, Williams, & Harkins, 1979; Steiner,1972). One proposed reason for motivation lossesis that individuals might realize that their con-tribution cannot be identiﬁed and thus evaluated(Harkins & Jackson, 1985). Furthermore, groupmembers may perceive their contributions asdispensable and hence reduce their effort whilefree-riding on the contributions of the others(Kerr & Bruun, 1983). These explanations assumethat the basic motivation of each individualcannot be intrinsic to working per se or to maxi-mize the group’s utility. It is rather assumed thatthe basic motivation of each individual consists inmaximizing individual utility, hence maximizingthe individual input–output ratio, an assumptionunderlying neoclassical economics.Group work can be viewed as a social dilemma(Kerr, 1983) inasmuch as the strategy ‘not to con-tribute to the group product’ dominates thestrategy ‘to contribute’, no matter what the othergroup members are doing. However if no onecontributes, the collective is worse off as thegroup does not produce. In other words, groupmembers have an incentive to defect as long astheir contributions are additive and the mem-bers’ main aim is to achieve a maximal individualoutcome. But pursuing that strategy is notconducive to group productivity, and hence inconﬂict with the collective interest.The products of groups have an enormoussignificance in our lives. In the past, whenmanufacturing was the predominant industry,the pooling of physical effort was important.More recently, as more jobs are generated in theknowledge industry, joint effort in cognitive taskshas gained in importance. Examples of collect-ive effort on cognitive tasks include writinga joint report, developing a commercial com-puter program, or operating an air trafﬁc controlsystem. In addition, globalization is leading tofaster moving societies and changing traditionalvalues. Values like modesty, diligence and honestyhave the taste of being old-fashioned, whileself-actualization, pursuing a career and cultivat-ing a healthy narcissism are on the agenda(e.g. Hogan & Blake, 1996). If the spirit of the21st century is dominated by pursuing one’s ownindividual goals, and on the other hand, team40work is important, then an issue arises as to whattypes of people can work effectively in teams.In the current research, we address the issueof whether all individuals are equally inclinedto loaf in collective work, or whether there is away to differentiate systematically team workersfrom team loafers. After all, when team work isso important, a way to identify those who stillexert effort in groups would seem importantfor all concerned. Before we turn to the speciﬁcquestion of what motivates people to contributeto a group product, we will brieﬂy summarize thesocial psychological explanations for reducedgroup productivity.Motivation losses in group workSince the discovery and analysis of the Ringelmanneffect (see Ingham, Levinger, Graves, & Peckham,1974; Kravitz & Martin, 1986; Moede, 1927),we know that group work compared to indi-vidual work often results in productivity losses.Latane et al. (1979) showed that the decreasedproductivity is caused both by coordinationloss and by effort reduction. They interpretedthe effort reduction as a result of motivationlosses and called it ‘social loaﬁng’. With emerg-ing research the phenomenon of motivationlosses in groups has been given different labelsdepending on the circumstantial conditions.Social loaﬁng stems from the realization thatthe individual contribution cannot be iden-tiﬁed and thus evaluated (Harkins & Jackson,1985). The potential for evaluation can comefrom other group members, external sources (e.g.the experimenter), or from the possibility forself-evaluation, and any of these can eliminate theeffect (Harkins & Szymanski, 1989; Szymanski &Harkins, 1987). Free-riding stems from theperception that the individual’s contribution isdispensable, even if it is identiﬁable and apprais-able (Kerr & Brunn, 1983; for a detailed analysisof task type and possible motivation losses inthe framework of social dilemmas, see alsoArnscheid, Diehl & Stroebe, 1997). The sucker-effect results from the perception that othersare free-riding on one’s contributions or efforts(Orbell & Dawes, 1981). In this case it is theAbele and Diehl the protestant work ethic and group performancepotential of the averseness of this role, whichmakes the individual reduce his/her effort.Kerr (1983) argues that the violation of certainsocial norms like the equity norm, the norm ofreciprocity and the norm of social responsibil-ity make the sucker role uncomfortable. In thelast decade motivation losses in group perform-ance have been linked to general theories ofmotivation (Karau & Williams, 1993; Shepperd,1993; Shepperd & Taylor, 1999).The proposed underlying mechanism for thefree-rider effect and social loaﬁng are based onthe assumption that individuals’ main drivingforce is to maximize individual outcomes whileminimizing input. The proposed underlyingmechanism for the sucker-effect is, in a sense,distinct from the other two, as it is based on theassumption that behavior can also be driven byother motives and needs like feeling sociallyequal and accepted. An obvious question iswhether other motives, as for instance seeingwork as something valuable per se, may playimportant roles in group work also.What moderates motivation losses ingroup workKarau and Williams’ (1993) meta-analytic re-view concludes that motivation losses in groupwork is a robust phenomenon which generalizesacross tasks and populations. Above we havebrieﬂy mentioned variables that play a role inthe underlying processes of motivation lossesin groups. Among those, evaluation potential,expectations of coworker performance, taskmeaningfulness and culture were found to havea consistent impact (Karau & Williams, 1993).Moreover, individual differences have alsobeen shown to moderate motivation losses ingroups. Need for cognition refers to the tend-ency to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitiveendeavors (Cacioppo & Petty, 1982). Smith, Kerr,Markus, and Stasson (2001) demonstrated thatthe need for cognition can moderate motivationlosses in group work: individuals high in needfor cognition worked equally hard on a vigilancetask, regardless of whether they were workingcollectively or coactively. Individuals low in needfor cognition, however, exerted considerably lesseffort when working collectively compared toworking coactively.Hart, Karau, Stasson, and Kerr (2004) showedthat people high in achievement motivationexerted equal effort whether they were work-ing coactively or collectively and whether theyexpected the other person to exert high or loweffort. However, people low in achievementmotivation reduced their effort most whenworking collectively with somebody from whomthey expected high effort. Hence, apparently theyreduced their effort when they perceived theircontribution as dispensable and not identiﬁable.However, what is not clear in their study is howparticipants interpreted the allegedly predictedeffort of their team member. When induced toexpect low effort, participants received the mes-sage that their team partner found the taskvery interesting but was not going to exertmuch effort on it. This message is ambiguous.Participants could have attributed the reducedeffort of their partner to their lack of willingnessor of capability. Neither of these attributions iscompelling. On the one hand, why would some-body reduce effort on a task that she/he ﬁndsinteresting? On the other hand, why would lackof ability lead to a reduction of effort? More-over, the source of attribution for the reducedeffort plays an important role in social loaﬁng.Reduced input from a team member due tolack of ability evokes quite different reactionsthan reduced effort due to a lack of willingness(Kerr, 1983).As noted above, previous research has shownthat need for cognition and achievement motiv-ation moderate reduction of effort in collectivework. However, effects of these moderators wouldnot differ depending on whether a partner’sreduced effort stemmed from unwillingnessor inability. People high in need for cognitionor achievement motivation would sustain theireffort regardless of the reason for the partner’sreduced effort. In these cases, the enjoyment ofthe task (need for cognition) or the desire toachieve are not dampened by a partner’s lack ofmotivation or ability. However, beliefs regardingthe value of work and the importance of equityshould moderate one’s reactions to a partnerand her/his reasons for reducing effort.41Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 11(1)The Protestant Work EthicIn 1905 Max Weber published ‘The Protestantethic and the spirit of capitalism’. The basic ideawas that the Protestant ethic was an importantfactor in the economic success of Protestantgroups in the early stages of capitalism. Worldlysuccess was interpreted as a sign of righteousnessand therefore vigorously pursued. Since Weber,anthropologists, economists, sociologists, his-torians and psychologists have been interestedin the issue of the Protestant Work Ethic (PWE).Psychologists were not concerned with whetherWeber was right or wrong but translated the con-cept into an individual difference construct.McClelland (1961) was the ﬁrst to use the con-cept of PWE within psychology. His explanationfor the association between Protestantismand capitalism was the following. Parents, whohave internalized Protestant values, reared theirchildren in ways that foster independence,rationality and delay of gratiﬁcation. Instillingthese values produces children with a highachievement motivation, and people with ahigh achievement motivation are very likelyto contribute to the expansion of business. Hesubsumed the concept of PWE under need forachievement. Placing PWE in this conceptualcontext has been criticized because it emphasizesonly the ‘hard work-aspect’ of the work ethic andleaves out other aspects. Nonetheless, the ideathat high achievement motivation is a relativelystable disposition which has its roots in earlysocialization led others to construe PWE be-liefs as an individual difference of conceptualinterest. The research focus shifted from theetiology of the PWE to the measurement of theconstruct and to its relationships to behaviorpatterns and other belief systems. Several self-report measures were developed (e.g. Blood,1969; Buchholz, 1976; Goldstein & Eichhorn,1961; Hammond & Williams, 1976; Ho, 1984;Mirels & Garrett, 1971; Ray, 1982). Using thesemeasures, PWE has been shown to correlate withbehaviors and other constructs. Persons witha high PWE are industrious, ambitious, hardworking and intrinsically motivated (Furnham,1990a), stemming from the attitude that workwill and should pay off. They tend to have an42internal locus of control in matters that arelinked to work (Lied & Pritchard, 1976) andare not easily affected by external factors. Theirbehavioral orientation in a free-choice period isto work equally hard on the task regardless of theperformance feedback (Furnham, 1990a). More-over, they are inclined to apply an equity norm,as opposed to an equality norm, in deciding howto distribute a resource (Greenberg, 1978).Equity norm refers to a proportional input–output relation. People perceive a distributionas fair when their own ratio of inputs to outputsequals the input–output ratio of others. Putdifferently, according to equity norm, rewardsshould be distributed in direct proportion tothe effort each group member exerts (Adams,1965; Walster, Berscheid & Walster, 1973).In contrast to that, the equality norm does notfocus on the input–output relation in deter-mining whether justice or injustice is perceived,but merely on an equal size of the output. Hence,the equality norm would suggest an equaldistribution of rewards irrespective of inputs(Homans, 1958, 1961).The relationships among componentsof PWE, free-riding and beingthe suckerThe purpose of the current study is to investigatethe PWE as a moderator of motivation losses ingroup work.

Thus different components mightbe responsible for the behavioral correlates andassociations with other personality constructsand attitudes, which were described above.

Participants worked in dyads on apotentially divisible task.In the free-rider condition, participants wereled to believe that their partner was capable ofthe task by the initial feedback on the task perfor-mance. In the free-rider control condition,participants performed the task individually.In the sucker effect condition, hereafter referredto as the sucker condition, the partner of the par-ticipant is portrayed as capable by the initialfeedback on task performance. The feedbackafter the ﬁrst three trials revealed that the teamdid quite well on the task, but that the par-ticipant’s contribution consistently exceeded the‘partner’s’ contribution. The ‘partner’ of the par-ticipant was a confederate of the experimenter. Inorder to have the participants really attribute the‘partner’s’ smaller contribution to his reducedeffort and not to lower ability, the confederatedisplayed boredom by scripted behavior. Inthe sucker effect control condition, hereafterreferred to as the sucker control condition, theparticipant’s contribution exceeded the ‘part-ner’s’ contribution. But here the participant wasled to believe by the initial task performancefeedback that their partner’s task ability waslow. During the initial trials, the confederatecommented on the difﬁculty of the task.Participants and designEighty male students from University Col-lege London participated in the experiment.Because of the sex difference in the sucker-effect (Kerr, 1983) only males were included.44Participants were randomly assigned to oneof the four experimental conditions (free-rider,free-rider control, sucker or sucker control).Thus, the design was a four independent groupdesign.Measurement of PWEThe endorsement of the PWE was assessed withthe Protestant Work Ethic Scale from Mirels &Garrett (1971) and the Australian Work EthicScale from Ho (1984). Despite the theoreticalinclusion of the equity/equality norm in theconcept of PWE as a variable of individual dif-ferences, these scales do not include items thatmeasure directly a preference for equity orequality. Therefore, nine additional items werecreated to assess the degree to which participantsendorse the equity norm. Examples of suchitems are: ‘The trouble with giving people equalrewards for work is that they very rarely workequally hard’ or ‘When a task is completed by ateam there is nothing wrong with distributing thereward equally regardless of unequal input’.TaskThe task that the participants performed inthree trials was the ‘d2’ concentration test(Brickenkamp, 1994). In this test, participantsare confronted with a sheet full of the letters‘d’ and ‘p’ which have one to four lines aboveor beneath them. The task is to work throughthe lines of letters and cross out every ‘d’ thathas two lines with it. To provide a rationale forparticipants to complete this task in teams andto deﬂect their attention from our interest inindividual performance in collective endeavors,the following cover story was presented:This study is about how to design the task of manuallychecking transfer slips most efﬁciently.

People are instructedhow to ﬁll in these forms, so that the computer canread them, but still a given percentage cannot beread by the computers. When the computers readthe forms, the information is translated into a code.This code then appears on a screen, and consistsAbele and Diehl the protestant work ethic and group performanceof signs and abnormalities. The signs representinformation from the transfer slip that could beread properly, whereas the abnormalities stemfrom information that could not be read properly.Somebody has to detect the abnormalities, whichdemands a continuously high concentration and isa boring task. A short period of inattention will leadto a greater amount of undetected abnormalities,which will be noticed in the succeeding processing.The study tests whether sharing the task so that thecode would come up on two screens has an im-pact. Another feature that the study addresses iswhether and how much feedback and feedbackfrequencies have an impact on performance. Hence,participants will be working on a task, where theyhave to detect abnormal signs in a list of abnormaland normal signs (they were doing this either withanother person or alone) and will be given feedbackin regular frequencies.ProcedureAfter arrival participants were asked to com-plete the PWE questionnaires, which were saidto be part of a different research project. Theywere then told the alleged purpose of the studybefore they were randomly assigned to one ofthe four conditions. With the exception ofthe free-rider control condition, participantswere told that they would work at the task as acooperative team and that their performanceswould be summed and they would be rewardedfor their combined performance regardlessof their individual contributions. Participantswere guaranteed £2 as a reward and they weretold that they could earn up to £3 dependingon their combined performance. £3 was worthapproximately US$5. Eventually everybody waspaid £3. Participants were then made familiarwith the requirements of the task by practicing ona line of letters. During the actual experimentaltrials participants were wearing headphones.The command to start was given via these head-phones. Furthermore, during the trials therewas ofﬁce noise in the room in order to preventthe participants from overhearing each other’sspeed.The ﬁrst trial lasted for one minute and par-ticipants were told that this trial was meant toassess their initial ability. The second to thefourth trials lasted for two and a half minuteseach. The experimenter left the room while the‘teams’ were actually working on the task. Be-havior in the room could be monitored througha glass window in the door. After each trial theexperimenter returned, took the sheets fromthe participants and allegedly scored them inthe same room.Participants were told that their feedbackwould compare their performance to the aver-age performance by other participants. In allexperimental conditions participants were giventhe feedback after the ﬁrst trial in which theirown performance, which was supposedly theinitial ability, was 20% above average. In the suckercondition and the free-rider condition they were toldthat their partner’s performance was 20% aboveaverage as well, whereas in the control conditionto the sucker-effect the performance feedback forthe partner was 5% below average.After the ﬁrst trial in the sucker condition, theconfederate yawned and stretched and startedto lean back with his chair while the sheets werecorrected. After the second trial he again leanedbackwards and began to drum with his ﬁngerson the table. The performance feedback thenrevealed a combined result around 20% aboveaverage and a contribution of the participant tothe total of about 60%. After the third trial theconfederate mumbled to himself ‘it’s gettingboring’, while the experimenter was still outsidethe room. The performance feedback for thistrial then again revealed a combined result thatwas 20% above average, to which the participanthad again contributed more than 60%.In the sucker control condition the confederatesaid after the ﬁrst trial, ‘I can’t tell them apart’.After the second trial he moaned and said tohimself ‘it is really difﬁcult’. The combined re-sult was said to be 20% above average and thecontribution of the participant about 60%. Afterthe third trial the confederate said ‘not easy’while handing his sheet over to the experimenter.Feedback for this trial then revealed the sameresult as for the second trial.In the free-rider condition participants weretold after the second and third trials that theytogether achieved 20% above average; no infor-mation was given concerning the individual45Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 11(1)contributions to the team performance. In thefree-rider control condition participants were giventhe feedback that they achieved about 20% aboveaverage after each trial.Feedback was never provided after the fourthtrial in any of the four experimental conditions.After the fourth trial, participants were askedto complete a questionnaire that functioned asa manipulation check. Participants were thendebriefed, thanked and paid.ResultsThe PWEIn order to disentangle the components of theglobal construct a principal component factoranalysis with varimax rotation was conductedusing all of the items from the questionnaires.A scree plot indicated the presence of three fac-tors. These three factors accounted for 38.6%of the variance. The ﬁrst factor accounted for13.23% of the variance. Items loading high onthis factor portray the attitude that work has amoral value. It was therefore called the EthicalFactor. The second factor explained 12.9% ofthe variance. Items loading high on this factorcapture the notion that work should and willpay off. It was therefore called the InstrumentalFactor. The third factor explained 12.5% ofthe variance, and items loading high on thisfactor measure the attitude to the equity prin-ciple. This factor was called the Equity Factor.Examples for items loading high on the re-spective factors can be found in the Appendix.Factor scores were computed to be used lateras a measure of individual differences on thethree dimensions.Analysis of the performance dataFour participants had to be excluded from theanalysis; one had suspicions about the con-federate and the other three did not completethe task properly. Table 1 reveals the meanraw performance scores in all four conditionsfor the four trials. Raw performances are thenumber of all correctly marked signs minusall false positives (signs marked which shouldnot have been) and misses (unmarked signsthat should have been marked prior to the lastcorrectly marked sign).The primary dependent variable was perform-ance on the fourth trial. As depicted in Table 1,scores in the fourth trial in the free-ridercondition (M = 282.26) and in the sucker con-dition (M = 279.47) were lower than in thefree-rider control condition (M = 316.8) and inthe control condition sucker-effect (M = 295.8).A one-way analysis of covariance was performed,with the performance in the fourth trial as adependent variable, and the performance onthe ﬁrst trial as a covariate. The ﬁrst trial wasused as a covariate in order to control for indi-vidual differences in performance before theintroduction of the experimental manipulationsand hence reduce error variance. There wasa main effect of the condition (F(3, 71) = 3.2,p < .028). Also the effect of the covariate wassigniﬁcant (F(1, 71) = 58,7, p < .001). Table 2contains the mean performances adjusted forthe covariate.Two contrasts were calculated to test for thefree-rider effect and the sucker-effect, respect-ively. The comparison for the free-rider to thefree-rider control was signiﬁcant (F(1, 67) = 5.67,p < .05). The comparison of the sucker effectTable 1.

The effect of thetrial 1 performance and free rider conditionswere signiﬁcant, conﬁrming the results from thecovariance analysis. The interactions with thePWE score was not signiﬁcant (t(34) < 1, ns).Sucker-effect and PWE factorsFor each of the PWE factors, a regression an-alysis was conducted using only participantsfrom the sucker control condition and thesucker-effect condition. The regression modelused performance on the fourth trial as thedependent variable and trial 1 performance,sucker-effect conditions and factor scores aspredictors. Also included was an interactionterm of condition by respective factor score.All predictors were centered before conductingthe regression. In all the regressions the effectof the trial 1 performance and sucker conditionwere signiﬁcant, conﬁrming the results from thecovariance analysis. The interaction of suckercondition by factor score was signiﬁcant for allcomponents: instrumental factors (t(36) = 2.01,p > .05), ethical factor (t(36) = 2.19, p < .036) andequity factor (t(36) = 2.06, p < .048). Thus thesucker-effect was different for people who scoredhigh and low on all of the PWE factors.To better understand the nature of theinteractions of PWE factors and the sucker-effect, estimated means for people scoring onestandard deviation above and one standarddeviation below the mean on each factor wereobtained using the regression model. Theseestimated means are plotted for participantsin the experimental sucker and sucker controlconditions in Figures 1 to 3.Participants, who endorsed the idea that workshould and will pay off, worked almost as hardin the sucker control condition (M = 285.09) asthey did in the sucker experimental condition(M = 281.69). But participants who did not seework as something that should and will payoff worked harder when working with some-body who was contributing less because ofability (M = 306.44), than when working withsomeone who contributed less due to lack ofeffort (M = 272.05). Thus, people endorsing theinstrumental value of work were not affected bybeing the sucker. They seemed to focus more ontheir part of the work even if the other was notworking hard. People who believed less in thelong-range instrumental value of work workedharder when their partner was incapable thanwhen he was unwilling to exert effort.47Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 11(1)Figure 1. Sucker-effect moderated by individual dif-ferences in the belief in the instrumental value ofwork.Figure 2. Sucker-effect moderated by individualdifferences in the belief in the ethical value of work.Endorsement of the ethical value of workand of equity produced similar patterns inthe sucker conditions. When their partner wasincapable, participants who endorsed the ethicalvalue of work (M = 306.84) and who endorsedthe equity principle (M = 310.32) workedharder than those who did not subscribe to theethical value of work (M = 263.18) and to theprinciple of equity (M = 271.4). In contrast,participants who did not endorse the ethicalvalue of work and participants who subscribedto the equality principle exerted about the sameeffort regardless of whether their partner wasperforming poorly due to inability or due to48Figure 3. Sucker-effect moderated by individualdifferences in the belief in equity.lack of trying. So apparently belief in the ethicalvalue of work and adherence to the equityprinciple led participants to compensate for anincapable partner but to avoid being a sucker.Free-rider effect and PWE factorsFor each of the PWE factors, a regression an-alysis was conducted using only participantsfrom the free rider condition and the freerider control condition. The regression modelused performance on the fourth trial as thedependent variable and trial 1 performance,free rider effect conditions and scale score aspredictors. Also included was an interaction termof condition by scale score. All predictors werecentered before the regression was conducted.In all the regressions the effect of the trial 1performance and free rider conditions weresigniﬁcant, conﬁrming the results from thecovariance analysis. The predicted interaction offree-rider condition by instrumental scale scorewas only marginally signiﬁcant (t(38) = 1.49p < .07, one-tailed). The interactions with theequity and ethical scale were not signiﬁcant.Thus the free-rider effect was marginally dif-ferent only for people who scored high and lowon the instrumental component of PWE. Theestimated means for people scoring one standarddeviation above and one standard deviationbelow the mean on the instrumental factor wereobtained using the regression model. Theseestimated means are plotted for participantsAbele and Diehl the protestant work ethic and group performancein the experimental free-rider and free ridercontrol conditions in Figure 4.Figure 4. Free-rider effect by individual differences inthe belief in the instrumental value of work.Participants who believed in the instrumentalvalue of work showed no difference in perform-ance in the free rider control condition(M = 312.82) and the free-rider experimentalcondition (M = 307.36). But participants whodid not believe in the instrumental value of workwere affected by the situational circumstances intheir effort exertion. When working alone, theyworked harder (M = 309.66) than when workingas a team (M = 262.52) with an allegedly skilledperson and individual contributions were notidentiﬁable.DiscussionThe purpose of this study was to investigate themoderating effects of attitudes toward work, asembodied in the global construct of the PWE,on motivation losses in performance groups. Wedistinguished two types of motivation loss whichwe suggest involve distinctly different psycho-logical processes. More speciﬁcally, the sucker-effect is a reaction to reduced effort by othersin collective work and, as the name implies, tothe potential of one’s own effort being exploitedby others. The free-rider effect is the robusttendency to reduce effort in collective work whenindividual contributions are not identiﬁable.Our experimental setup induced both sucker-and free-rider effects. When participants wereworking with another individual and theirindividual contributions were combined and un-identiﬁable, they produced less than when theythought they were working alone—the classicfree-rider effect. When they were working withanother person whose output was relatively low,they produced less when they thought the otherperson was not trying than when they thoughtthe other person was not capable—the classicsucker-effect.Our purpose was to examine whether com-ponents of PWE moderate the inclinationsto reduce effort in the free-riding and suckerconditions. Based on past work with PWE (e.g.Furnham,1990b; Heaven, 1989), we anticipatedthat the global construct was a combinationof at least three components: belief that workwill be rewarded (instrumental component),belief that hard work is a marker of righteousness(ethical component) and belief that peopleought to be rewarded equitably for their work(equity component). We constructed the gobalmeasure of PWE from items taken from Mirelsand Garrett (1971) and Ho and Lloyd (1984) andadded additional items designed to measuremore preferences for equity in the distribution ofresources. We factor analyzed responses to itemsfrom this global measure and obtained distinctfactors that corresponded to the anticipatedcomponents of belief in the ethical value of work,the instrumental value of work and the equityprinciple.Even though they are distinct, conceptually andempirically, the factors are strongly correlatedwith the traditional measures of PWE. Forexample the instrumental factor correlated.85 with the Ho and Lloyd’s (1984) PWE scaleand .48 with the PWE scale used by Mirels andGarrett (1971). The ethical factor also correlatedstrongly with the Mirels and Garrett scale (r = .74)but modestly with the Ho and Lloyd measure(r = .27). The equity factor, not surprisingly giventhat it consisted largely of items not contained inthese traditional measures, correlated modestlyboth with the Mirels and Garrett scale (r = .38)and with the Ho and Lloyd scale (r = .27).We expected that these components of PWEwould moderate free-riding and sucker- effectsin different ways. Concerning the sucker-effect49Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 11(1)and a potential moderating role of the PWE,we had two contrasting hypotheses. On the onehand, we speculated that people high in theinstrumental value component of PWE wouldnot show the sucker-effect because of their beliefthat hard work pays off in the long run. On theother hand, people who subscribe strongly toan equity norm should show the sucker-effectin that they would react to the violation of theequity norm in a situation where a partner is, bychoice, coasting. Thus, we did not expect thatthe global measure of PWE would moderate thesucker-effect and it did not.Our expectation regarding the moderatinginﬂuence of the instrumental component on thesucker-effect was conﬁrmed. Participants whobelieved in the long-range instrumental value ofwork were not affected by the reasons for theirpartner’s low output. Whether he contributedless than the participant due to lack of abilityor to lack of motivation did not seem to matterto them. In contrast, participants who did notendorse the instrumental value of work exertedmore effort when their partner was incapablerather than lazy. Somewhat surprisingly, theseparticipants who were low on the instrumentalcomponent actually worked harder whenpaired with an incapable partner than did theparticipants who were high on the instrumentalcomponent. Thus, it seems that people whodo not subscribe to the instrumental value ofwork are willing to compensate for a capabilitydeﬁcit, perhaps in order to gain the immedi-ate incentives for high production. That is, forthem, work may not lead invariably to rewardsor be rewarding in itself but, when beneﬁts aredirectly tied to collective production, they willcompensate for less capable coworkers.As predicted, participants who endorsed theequity principle were affected by the suckermanipulations. If their partner provided theimpression that the participant could becomethe sucker, those who reported a preference forequity over equality reduced their effort con-siderably. In comparison, when they thoughttheir team partner was less capable at thetask, they exerted extra effort to compensatefor their partner’s deﬁcits. Apparently it mattersfor people endorsing the equity principle50why a coworker’s contributions are subpar. Ifpoor performance is due to a lack of ability, theyalmost appear to act according to the principlethat input should be proportional to individualresources or ability. If they do not have anyreason to believe that resources or abilities aredisproportionate, they are sensitive to the subparcontributions of their partner and exert lesseffort. People who are more likely to endorsethe equality norm do not seem to be affectedby the reason for their partner’s lesser input.If it appears to be lack of motivation or skill,it does not seem to affect them. They do notendorse the equity norm, and consequently, itseems that they do not experience any dangerof becoming a sucker in the light of a violationof such a norm.People who see hard work as an ethical markeralso react to the apparent reasons that a coworkeris performing poorly. Participants who believedin the ethical value of work were affected by theapparent cause of their partners’ inferior con-tributions to the collective product. They, likeequity endorsers seemed willing to compensatefor lack of ability. However, they reduced theirinput when the partner was loaﬁng. Thus, theethical value that people see in work is not simplyself-focused (i.e. ‘If I work hard, I am good’) butalso other-focused (i.e. ‘Lazy people are bad’).In other words, people who believe in the ethicalvalue of work have a broader moral concern.When they are working with somebody who doesnot seem to spend much effort on the task, theyare not willing to compensate for the other’slack of effort and, in the spirit of defendingtheir moral claim, are prepared to foregopart of their reward. Hence defending theirmoral claim seems more important than theexternal reward. People who do not believe inthe ethical value of work, have less of a missionto defend some ethical principle, and hence donot appear to experience great psychologicalcosts if another person might free-ride on theireffort. Consequently they exerted the sameeffort, no matter whether the other person wasincapable or not motivated.Contrary to our predictions, the global PWEmeasure did not moderate the free-rider effect.Moreover, the free rider effect was only weaklyAbele and Diehl the protestant work ethic and group performancerelated to the belief in the instrumental valueof work. The trends suggest that people whobelieve in the notion that work should and willpay off did not take advantage of the possibil-ity to free-ride on somebody else’s effort. Theyworked equally hard when working alone andwhen working with another when contribu-tions were not identiﬁable. Participants whobelieved to a lesser extent in the instrumentalvalue of work were affected by the social context.When it needed their individual effort to get thereward they worked much harder, compared tothe situation in which they could free-ride onsomebody else’s effort.In sum, neither the sucker effect nor the free-rider effect was moderated by the global con-struct of PWE. However the sucker-effect seemedto be moderated in different ways by the threecomponents of the PWE, namely the beliefin the ethical value of work, the belief in theinstrumental value of work and the endorsementof the equity principle. The free-rider effect,on the other hand, seems to be only marginallymoderated by the belief in the instrumentalvalue of work.Sucker and free-rider effects seem to be quali-tatively different motivation losses in group per-formance. The sucker-effect is moderated bybeliefs about the instrumental and ethical valueof work and preferences for equity, whereas thesecomponents tells us less about who is likely tofree-ride. One potentially contributing differencebetween avoiding being the sucker and free-riding is that avoiding the sucker role is a reactionto the behavior, anticipated or actual, of anotherperson. In the experimental manipulation of thesucker-effect, the other person is giving the im-pression that he is lowering their input becausehe does not feel like working hard. Consequentlythe participant sees the danger that he mightbe exploited, and the psychological cost of ex-ploitation is higher than foregoing part of themonetary reward for high productivity. Butthese psychological costs are not experiencedby everybody alike. More speciﬁcally, it is subjectto individual differences that are bundled in thePWE construct. A high belief in the instrumentalvalue of work makes you immune to the sucker-effect. Thus, instrumental value seems to bea more self-focused belief in the long-rangebeneﬁts of working hard and thus less responsiveto the social context. A strong endorsementof the equity principle makes one particularlyvulnerable to the sucker-effect. Seemingly, thepsychological costs of exploitation are perceivedas high by people who believe in equity, andthus they avoid being the sucker. Interestinglya strong belief in the ethical value of work alsomakes one especially vulnerable to the suckereffect, suggesting that the cost of compensatingfor another’s laziness is too costly.The free-rider effect does not seem to beaffected so strongly by the PWE components.Although it appears that belief in the instrumentalvalue of work may reduce free-riding, thisevidence in our data is statistically weak. More-over, we obtained no evidence that the ethicalvalue and equity preference moderate free-riding. One possible reason is that people maynot be aware of the reduction of effort that welabel free-riding. If they are not aware that theyare working less hard in a collective effort, theirbeliefs about the work and equity may not berelevant. Moreover, it is clear that motivationloss in a free-rider situation is less of an affectivereaction than in a sucker effect condition. Froma certain perspective, free-riding seems rational.That is, reducing effort in team situations aftergetting joint feedback that the team is doingwell could be an adaptive approach to collectiveendeavors. In the long run, it is functional tosave one’s resources when they are apparentlynot needed for future endeavors when theymay be needed. This strategy does not neces-sarily contradict the ethical value of work.In conclusion, we examined individual dif-ferences in free-riding and sucker-effects incollective work. People who believe in equity andthe ethical value of work are particularly sensitiveto being the sucker and, thus, reduce their owneffort rather than compensate for the lazinessof a coworker. By comparison, people who be-lieve that work should and will be rewarded inthe long-run do not seem to react to being thesucker. There is also a tendency for these peoplewho believe in the instrumental value of workto be less likely to free-ride. One implication isthat belief in the instrumental value of work is51Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 11(1)a guide for one’s own behavior: ‘If I work hard,I will be rewarded’. In contrast, both the ethicalcomponent of PWE and the equity norm areprescriptions not only about how one shouldact but also how one should react to others’expenditures of effort in collective work.AcknowledgmentThis work was supported by a Grant from theDAAD (Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst)awarded to the ﬁrst author.We are grateful to Adrian Furnham for givingus every facility to run the experiment at theUniversity College London.
