German participants expected Muslims to be more aggressivethan Christians, and therefore be more supportive of terrorism than Christians. Furthermore,Muslims were assumed to be more intrinsically religious and to hold a stronger identity withtheir religion than Christians (Study 1). However, self-assessment surveys of Muslims andChristians in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS: ex-Soviet Union) revealed thatMuslims were not more aggressive, more intrinsically religious, or more supportive of terrorismthan Christians. In contrast, Muslims reported a stronger religious identiÔ¨Åcation than Christians(Study 2). Correspondingly, threat to religious identity was found to affect only Muslims‚Äô, butnot Christians‚Äô, attitudes toward terrorism conducted by outgroup perpetrators. In contrast toGermans‚Äô implicit theories regarding Muslims, it was the importance of religious identity andnot increased aggression potential that mediated this effect (Study 3).keywords aggression, Christians, Muslims, religious identiÔ¨Åcation, terrorismOver the past 5 years, proliÔ¨Åc and devastatingt e r r o r i s t a t t a c k s c o n d u c t e d b y I s l a m i cfundamentalists in America (mostly notablythe World Trade Center attack of September11, 2001), the European Union (e.g. the trainAuthor‚Äôs noteAddress correspondence to Peter Fischer,Department of Psychology, Social PsychologyUnit, Ludwig-Maximilians-University,Leopoldstrasse 13, 80802 Munich, Germany[e-mail: pÔ¨Åscher@psy.uni-muenchen.de]Copyright ¬© 2007 SAGE Publications(Los Angeles, London, New Delhi and Singapore)10:3; 373‚Äì382; DOI: 10.1177/1368430207078697Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 10(3)bombing in Madrid on March 11, 2004; theLondon underground attack in July, 2005), Asia(e.g. the Bali bombings of October 12, 2002)and the Middle East (e.g. almost daily attacksand suicide bombings in Iraq and Israel) againstWestern interests and rival Islamic groupshave dramatically changed the global politicalclimate and are likely to have heavily impactedon the general perception that Westerners holdregarding Muslims. As a consequence of thesefrequent and recent terrorist attacks conductedby Islamic fundamentalists, in addition to otherfactors such as frequent media reports on ter-rorist attacks or political justiÔ¨Åcations of West-ern counterterrorist activity (e.g. ‚ÄòWar on terror‚Äôin Afghanistan and Iraq; ‚ÄòOperation EnduringFreedom‚Äô), speciÔ¨Åc implicit theories and stereo-types of ‚Äòhow Muslims really are‚Äô relative toChristians may have emerged within westernChristian societies. First of all, Muslims mightbe expected to be more intrinsically religiousthan Christians because many fundamentalistshave died (and are willing to sacriÔ¨Åce them-selves) as suicide bombers in the name of theirreligion. Second, religious identity might bemore important to Muslims than Christians,because many Muslim nations do not distinguishbetween church and state and thus try to preventsecularization. Third, because of frequent suicidebombings in Israel and Iraq, the broadcast exe-cutions of Americans and hostages of othernationalities in Iraq, and public proclamations byMuslim terrorist leaders (e.g. Osama Bin Laden)to Ô¨Åght the enemies of ‚Äòthe true faith‚Äô, Christiansmight expect Muslims to be extraordinarilyaggressive. Fourth, and Ô¨Ånally, because most ofthe recent spate of terrorist attacks were con-ducted by Islamic extremists, and due to otherpowerful media images such as those showingMuslims celebrating the attacks on the WorldTrade Center, Muslims might be expected tobe more supportive of terrorism as a justiÔ¨Åedpolitical instrument than Christians.1Why is it important to know more aboutWesterners‚Äô implicit theories of Muslims?Implicit theories are construction frameworksthat people use in everyday life to interpret andevaluate their social world (Dweck, Chiu, &Hong, 1995; Hong, Levy, & Chiu, 2001), guide374social judgments, and develop social actions(Levy, 1999; Levy, Plaks, Hong, Chiu, & Dweck,2001). If members of Western Christian societiesreally subscribe to the above-mentioned implicittheories on Muslims, it could have far rangingand serious consequences for the understandingof and social interaction with the Islamic world.An assumption by Christians that Muslims areextraordinarily aggressive or inclined towardsterrorism could be expected to lead to a differentattitude toward Muslims than an assumption thatthey are placid people who generally condemnterrorism.Because religiously motivated terrorism isone of the biggest social challenges facingmodern Western societies at the present time,in this study we primarily focused on expectedand actual attitudes of Muslims and Christianstoward terrorism, as well as the underlying psy-chological mechanisms propelling these percep-tions and attitudes. We report on three studiesthat investigated: Germans‚Äô implicit theorieson Muslims and Christians (Study 1); testedtheir validity with self-assessment surveys ofMuslims and Christians in the Commonwealthof Independent States (CIS: ex-Soviet Union)(Study 2); and Ô¨Ånally pointed out the speciÔ¨Åcrole of religious identity in attitudes toward ter-rorism as a political instrument (Study 3).Study 1Germans in Munich, Bavaria‚Äîa predominantlyCatholic and arguably the most conservativeof German states‚Äîwere asked about theirperceptions of Christians and Muslims livingin the CIS (which contains countries likeAzerbaijan, whose population is 95% Muslimand which is located near Iran) in terms oftheir religiousness, importance of religiousidentity, aggression potential, and attitudestoward terrorism. Compared to Christians, weassumed that Germans expected Muslims to be:(a) more intrinsically religious; (b) more stronglyreligiously identiÔ¨Åed; (c) more aggressive; and(d) more accepting of terrorism. We expectedthese perceptions to be independent of whetherGerman participants were of a Christian de-nomination or not. If our assumption wascorrect, then the expected effects should not belikely due to processes of social identity relatedto religious afÔ¨Åliation (Tajfel, 1982). In otherwords, expected effects should not be mainlybased on German Christians stereotyping ofMuslims because they consider the latter to bea religious outgroup.MethodParticipants and design In total, 119 passers-byat a pedestrian zone (67 females and 52 males,ages ranging from 15 to 66 years; M = 32.49,SD = 14.17) participated in Study 1, which wasbased on a 2 (religion of target group: Christianvs. Muslim) √ó 2 (denomination of participants:Christian vs. no denomination) factorial between-subject design.Material and procedure Participants were re-cruited at a pedestrian zone near the Ludwigs-Maximilians-University Munich campus andasked whether they would be willing to partici-pate in a study dealing with attitudes towardsdifferent religions. If they agreed, they were ledto an experimental lab at the nearby Universitycampus and read the following synopsis:Religion is an important part of many societies andmany peoples‚Äô daily life. Therefore, it is important tolearn as much as possible about religion in differentcultures. In the present study, we are interested inyour perception of Muslims (Christians) in the CIS(ex-Soviet Union).Subsequently, participants estimated Muslims‚Äô(Christians‚Äô) aggression potential using a Germantranslation of an aggression questionnaire byBuss and Perry (1992). This translation wasmodiÔ¨Åed from a Ô¨Årst-person to a third-personperspective (Œ± = .93). Next (and in keepingwith single-item measurement of attitudes), par-ticipants were asked on a scale from 0 (not at all )to 10 (extremely) to what extent they supposedthat Muslims (Christians) condone terrorism as ajustiÔ¨Åed political instrument. Lastly, participantsreported to what extent they assumed that religiousidentity is important to Muslims (Christians)(0 = not at all important; 10 = extremely important).The distinction between religiosity and religiousidentity is useful, because religiosity concernsFischer et al. muslims and terrorismthe degree of a person‚Äôs religious participationwhereas, by contrast, religious identity concernsthe afÔ¨Åliation of a person with a certain religiousgroup (see Regnerus, 2003, who also measuredimportance of religious identity using a singleitem). Finally, participants were asked to assessMuslims‚Äô (Christians‚Äô) degree of intrinsicreligiosity (Œ± = .61) in a German translation(Zwingmann, Hellmeister, & Ochsmann, 1994) ofthe religious orientation scale by Feagin (1964).Because intrinsic religiosity is the measure for‚Äòreal‚Äô and lived religiosity (Allport & Ross,1967; Bergin, 1991; Hill & Pargament, 2003),we only used intrinsic religiosity as a measure ofreligiosity (as opposed to extrinsic religiosity).Finally, participants indicated in open-endedquestion format their own religious denomination,were informed about the actual aim of theinvestigation, and were dismissed.Results and DiscussionA 2 √ó 2 √ó 4 factorial multivariate analysis of vari-ance (MANOVA) with ‚Äòreligion of target group‚Äô(Muslims vs. Christians) and ‚Äòdenominationof participants‚Äô (Christian vs. none) as between-participant factors, and intrinsic religiosity,importance of religious identity, aggressionpotential and attitudes toward terrorism asdependent variables, revealed a significantmain effect for ‚Äòreligion of target group‚Äô (multi-variate F(4, 112) = 9.25, p < .001, Œ∑2 = .25). Allmeans and standard deviations are reportedin Table 1. Univariate follow-up analyses revealedthat Muslims (compared to Christians) were ex-pected to be more intrinsically religious (F(1,115) = 20.29, p < .001, Œ∑2 = .15), to have a greaterreligious identiÔ¨Åcation (F(1, 115) = 8.35, p < .01,Œ∑2 = .07), to be more aggressive (F(1, 115) = 5.69,p = .02, Œ∑2 = .05), and to be more supportive ofterrorism as a justiÔ¨Åed political instrument(F(1, 115) = 15.66, p < .001, Œ∑2 = .12). No signiÔ¨Å-cant interaction was observed between ‚Äòreli-gion of target group‚Äô and ‚Äòdenomination ofparticipants‚Äô (multivariate F(4, 112) = 0.60,p > .66, Œ∑2 = .02), indicating that the effectsreported above were probably not mainly dueto processes of social categorization by (ordue to issues of social identity of) GermanChristians (compared to non-Christian German375Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 10(3)Table 1.

Preliminary regressionanalyses revealed that only the assumed aggres-sion potential was a potential mediator fordifferent expectations about Christians‚Äô andMuslims‚Äô attitudes toward terrorism. First ofall, a regression analysis with the experimentalcondition ‚Äòreligion of target group‚Äô as a predictorvariable and the dependent variable ‚Äòattitudestoward terrorism‚Äô as a criterion variable revealeda signiÔ¨Åcant regression weight (Œ≤ = ‚Äì.44; t(117)= ‚Äì5.22, p < .001). Second, a regression analysiswith ‚Äòreligion of target group‚Äô as a predictorand the assumed mediator ‚Äòexpected aggressionpotential‚Äô as a criterion variable also revealed asigniÔ¨Åcant regression weight (Œ≤ = ‚Äì.33; t(117)= ‚Äì3.81, p < .001). Third, a regression analysiswith the assumed mediator ‚Äòexpected aggressionpotential‚Äô as a predictor and the dependent376variable ‚Äòattitudes toward terrorism‚Äô as a criterionvariable revealed a significant regressionweight (Œ≤ = .66; t(117) = 9.44, p < .001). Finally,a regression analysis with the predictors ‚Äòreli-gion of target group‚Äô and ‚Äòexpected aggressionpotential‚Äô that simultaneously predicted thecriterion ‚Äòattitudes toward terrorism‚Äô revealeda signiÔ¨Åcant regression equation (R 2 = .49;F(2, 116) = 54.55, p < .001). Both the expectedaggression potential (Œ≤ = .58; t(117) = 8.16,p < .001) and ‚Äòreligion of target group‚Äô (Œ≤ = ‚Äì.24;t(117) = ‚Äì3.44, p < .01) reached a signiÔ¨Åcantregression weight. A Sobel Test revealed thatthe indirect effect of the independent variable(religion of target group) on the dependentvariable (attitudes toward terrorism) via themediator (expected aggression potential) wassigniÔ¨Åcantly different from zero (Z = ‚Äì3.44,p < .001). Hence, the unmediated Œ≤-coefÔ¨Åcientfor religion of target group on attitudes towardterrorism significantly decreased when theexpected aggression potential was controlledfor. Thus, the expected aggression potentialmediated the effect of religion of target groupon attitudes toward terrorism.In sum, Study 1 conÔ¨Årmed our expectations:German participants assumed Muslims to bemore religious, more aggressive, more stronglyidentiÔ¨Åed with their religion, and more acceptingof terrorism than Christians. Furthermore, amediational analysis revealed that participantsexpected Muslims to be more accepting of ter-rorism because they were expected to be moreaggressive than Christians. By contrast, intrinsicreligiosity and importance of religious identitywere not signiÔ¨Åcant mediators. In the next step,we investigated whether Muslims are indeedmore intrinsically religious, more stronglyidentiÔ¨Åed with their religion, more aggressive,and more supportive of terrorism than Christiansby directly surveying Christians and Muslims viaself-assessment.Study 2Muslims and Christians from the CIS were askedabout their intrinsic religiosity, the importanceof their religious identity, aggression potential,and their attitudes toward terrorism.MethodParticipants and design Participants wererecruited in two nations of the CIS (Ukraineand Azerbaijan). Fifty-one (27 females and24 males, ages ranging from 17 to 84 years;M = 42.43, SD = 15.12) Christians (N = 27; age:M = 40.67, SD = 14.76) and Muslims (N = 24; age:M = 44.00, SD = 15.80) participated in Study 2,which was based on a 2 (religion: Christian vs.Muslim) √ó 4 factorial multivariate design withintrinsic religiosity, importance of religious iden-tity, aggression, and attitudes toward terrorismas dependent variables.Material and procedure Participants readinstructions similar to those of Study 1. Theonly difference was that the present studyfocused on the participants‚Äô own attitudes,rather than on stereotypes and expectationsof Muslims and Christians. After having readthe introduction, participants indicated theirreligious denomination. Subsequently, par-ticipants answered a Russian translation ofthe same questions and scales used in Study 1;that is, a scale of intrinsic religiosity (Œ± = .79;Feagin, 1964), aggression potential (Œ± = .83;Buss & Perry, 1992), importance of religiousidentity, and attitudes toward terrorism. Finally,participants were informed about the aim of theinvestigation, thanked for their participation,and dismissed.Results and discussionA 2 √ó 4 MANOVA with religion of partici-pants (Muslims vs. Christians) as a between-participants factor, and intrinsic religiosity,importance of religious identity, aggression,and attitudes toward terrorism as dependentvariables, revealed a signiÔ¨Åcant main effect fortype of religion (multivariate F(4, 46) = 2.64,p < .05, Œ∑2 = .19). All means and standard de-viations are reported in Table 1. Univariatefollow-up analyses revealed that religiousidentity was more important to Muslims thanChristians (F(1, 49) = 4.51, p < .05, Œ∑2 = .08).In contrast, no differences between religiousgroups were observed regarding intrinsicreligiosity (F(1, 49) = 0.04, p = .85, Œ∑2 = .00),aggression potential (F(1, 49) = 0.12, p = .73,Fischer et al. muslims and terrorismŒ∑2 = .00), and attitudes toward terrorism(F(1, 49) = 3.10, p = .09, Œ∑2 = .06).Study 2 revealed that three of four implicittheories that Germans hold regarding Muslims(as compared to Christians) were without basis:Muslims did not report that they were more in-trinsically religious, more aggressive, or moresupportive of terrorism than Christians. How-ever, Muslims reported that their religiousidentity is more important to them than didChristians. This result might have importantimplications for Muslims‚Äô and Christians‚Äô atti-tudes toward terrorism as a political instrument:if a terrorist attack is conducted by a Christianperpetrator, then Muslims might experiencestrong religious identiÔ¨Åcation because they werethreatened by a perpetrator with a different(Christian) religious afÔ¨Åliation. However, if aterrorist attack is conducted by a Muslim per-petrator, then Muslims‚Äô religious identiÔ¨Åcationmight be less pronounced because the religiousafÔ¨Åliation of the perpetrator matches with theirown religious afÔ¨Åliation. In contrast, becausereligious identiÔ¨Åcation is less important forChristians than it is for Muslims, Christians‚Äôreligious identiÔ¨Åcation might be less affectedby the denomination or religious afÔ¨Åliationof a terrorist. As a consequence, Muslims (be-cause of the stronger religious identiÔ¨Åcation)might regard terrorism as less justiÔ¨Åed if theperpetrators were Christians compared to if theywere Muslims, whereas Christians‚Äô perceptionsof a terrorist attack (because of the less pro-nounced religious identiÔ¨Åcation) might be lessaffected by the religion of the perpetrator. Study 3was designed to test this line of thought.Study 3Muslims and Christians from the CIS read adescription of a religiously motivated terroristattack, which was either conducted by Muslimor Christian aggressors (i.e. threat to religiousidentity). Subsequently, participants indicatedto what extent they were (a) religious, (b) iden-tiÔ¨Åed with their religion, (c) aggressive, and(d) to what extent they perceived the terroristattack as justiÔ¨Åed. Because of the higher im-portance of religious identity, Muslims were377Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 10(3)expected to regard terrorism as less justiÔ¨Åedif the perpetrators were Christians than if theywere Muslims. In contrast, Christians were notexpected to be sensitive to the religious sourceof the attack. Furthermore, we expected thisinteraction effect to be mediated by importanceof religious identity‚Äîand not by a greateraggression potential of Muslims compared toChristians‚Äîas was suggested by the resultsfrom Study 1 on Westerner‚Äôs implicit theoriesabout Muslims.MethodParticipants and design Sixty (25 females and35 males, ages ranging from 18 to 67 years;M = 39.03, SD = 12.22) Christians (N = 30;age: M = 38.93, SD = 11.97) and Muslims(N = 30; age: M = 39.13, SD = 12.67) from the CISparticipated in Study 3. The study was based ona 2 (religion of participants: Christian vs. Muslim) √ó 2(religion of terrorists: Muslim vs. Christian) factorialbetween-subject design.Material and procedure First of all, participantsreceived a description of a terrorist attack, whichwas conducted either by Muslim or Christianextremists. This description was formulated asa Ô¨Åctive newspaper article and contained thefollowing information to be imagined by theparticipants:Religiously motivated aggression and terrorism hasincreased over the last few years, and has becomeone of the most challenging social problems facingthe modern world. In the following study, we wantto investigate the effects of religiously motivatedaggression on individuals‚Äô cognitions and emotions.In order to prevent biasing your assessments, wehave not named the location or date of the followingdescription of a disastrous terrorist attack; needlessto say, it was a tragic example of Muslim (Christian)aggression that was conducted in a major city inthe CIS some months ago by Muslim (Christian)terrorists. Fourteen people lost their lives andmany others were seriously injured. People in thatcity are still shocked and are desperately trying toreclaim a sense of normality in their lives. A letterfrom the terrorists revealed that Muslim (Christian)extremists, who approved of using force to furthertheir religious agenda, were responsible for thatterrorist attack.378Next, participants Ô¨Ålled out the same scales anditems as in the previous two studies: intrinsic reli-giosity (Œ± = .66), importance of religious identity,aggression potential (Œ± = .86), and attitude tothe terrorist attack. Finally, participants indicatedtheir religious denomination, were debriefed,informed about the aim of the investigation, anddismissed. Please note that all participants wereinformed that the described terrorist attack wasonly Ô¨Åctitious and not real. It was also ensuredthat no participant left the study with negativeemotions or mindsets.Results and discussionA 2 √ó 2 √ó 4 MANOVA revealed a signiÔ¨Åcant maineffect for the factor ‚Äòreligion of participants‚Äô(multivariate F(4, 53) = 4.53, p < .01, Œ∑2 = .26).All means and standard deviations are re-ported in Table 2. Univariate follow-up analysesrevealed that religious identity was more im-portant to Muslims (M = 8.10, SD = 3.12) thanChristians (M = 5.57, SD = 3.05), (F(1, 56) = 15.08,p < .01, Œ∑2 = .21). No further signiÔ¨Åcant differ-ences were revealed by the univariate analyses(all Fs < 1.60, all ps > .21).Table 2.

Thus, importance of religious identityMuslim terrorists (F(1, 28) = 7.25, p = .01, mediated the effect of religion of terrorists onŒ∑2 = .21). By contrast, no differences of import- the justiÔ¨Åcation of terrorism.ance of religious identity were recorded forChristian respondents when the terrorist attack General discussionwas conducted by Christian or Muslim terrorists,respectively (F(1, 28) = 0.42, p = .52, Œ∑2 = .02).Mediational analyses Preliminary analysesrevealed that only ‚Äòimportance of religiousidentity‚Äô could be a potential mediator of theinteraction effect of ‚Äòreligion of terrorists‚Äôand ‚Äòreligion of participant‚Äô on ‚ÄòjustiÔ¨Åcationof terrorism‚Äô. The aggression potential anddegree of intrinsic religiosity were not potentialmediators. Because the simple effects analysisrevealed that only Muslims‚Äô attitudes towardterrorism were affected by information aboutthe religious denomination of the terrorists,the following analyses for religious identity asa potential mediator were conducted only forMuslims.A regression analysis with the predictor‚Äòreligion of terrorists‚Äô and the criteria ‚ÄòjustiÔ¨Åca-tion of terrorist attack‚Äô revealed a signiÔ¨ÅcantWe found that Germans in Munich, Bavaria, ex-pected Muslims to be more intrinsically religious,more aggressive, more strongly identiÔ¨Åed withtheir religion, and more supportive of terrorismthan Christians, and that assumed/expected positiveattitudes toward terrorism were mediated by anexpected higher aggression potential of Muslims(Study 1). However, direct surveys of Muslimsand Christians in the CIS showed that thesereligious groups only differed with regard to theimportance of their religious identity: Muslimsreported a stronger identiÔ¨Åcation with theirreligion than did Christians (Study 2). From thisresult, we concluded that Muslims‚Äô (relative toChristians‚Äô) religious identity is more stronglyaffected by the religion of a terrorist perpetrator,which could possibly result in different attitudestoward terrorism (Study 3). As expected, Muslimsassessed a terrorist attack to be less justiÔ¨Åed if379Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 10(3)it was conducted by Christian extremists than if itwas conducted by Muslim extremists. In contrast,Christians‚Äô acceptance of a terrorist attack didnot depend on whether the perpetrators wereChristian or Muslim. Furthermore, this differ-ence between Muslims and Christians wasmediated by differences related to importanceof religious identity: when importance ofreligious identity and the religion of perpetrators(Muslim or Christian) were considered together,only the importance of religious identity affectedMuslims‚Äô attitudes toward terrorism. Note thatthis result clearly contradicted the Germans‚Äôimplicit theory that Muslims favor terrorismbecause they are extraordinarily aggressive.Muslims‚Äô attitudes towards terrorism did notdepend on an increased aggression potential,but on their own religious identity. Please alsonote that increased religious identiÔ¨Åcation ofMuslims did not lead to more justiÔ¨Åcation ofMuslim aggression, but to lowered justiÔ¨Åcationof Christian aggression. This clearly contradictsimplicit theories Westerners hold about Muslims(see Study 1).LimitationsThere were some limitations to our research thatmust be borne in mind. First of all, our sampleswere relatively small and thus not likely to berepresentative of Christians and Muslims else-where, nor of perceptions held by Christians andnonreligious individuals elsewhere. Future re-search should employ larger samples in orderto improve our ability to generalize our presentÔ¨Åndings. Second, although recent researchrevealed that Muslim youth in the USA are sig-niÔ¨Åcantly more religious than comparable non-Muslim youth in the USA (Ahmed, 2004), thereis doubt as to whether increased importance ofreligious identity is unique to Islam: other researchhas also shown that the centrality of religiousbeliefs in one‚Äôs life is a component of intrinsicreligiosity and religious fundamentalism, andneither of these two constructs are particularlyassociated with a speciÔ¨Åc religious content ordifferent religious denomination. For example,Hunsberger, Owusu, and Duck (1999) haveshown that the construct of religious fundamen-talism operates similarly across religious and380cultural contexts. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, for both GhanaianMuslims and Christians as well as for CanadianChristians, religious fundamentalism was posit-ively correlated with right-wing authoritarianismand positively associated with negative attitudestoward homosexuals (see also Hunsberger, 1996).In addition, Burris and Jackson (2000) havedemonstrated that, for a sample of Christians,intrinsic religious orientation was stronglycorrelated with religious group identiÔ¨Åcation.Intrinsically religious participants, whosereligious self-perceptions concerning religiousgroup membership were threatened, showedincreased religious self-stereotyping. For thesereasons, it is important to acknowledge thatthe results of the present studies‚Äîthat illustratestronger religious identiÔ¨Åcation among Muslimthan among Christian participants‚Äîmay bein part due to the context and/or small samplesfrom which the participants were recruited.Hence, future research should further investigatewhether different religious afÔ¨Åliations are asso-ciated with differences in religious identiÔ¨Åcationby employing larger samples and differentcultures.Third, Study 1 revealed that German partici-pants perceived Muslims more negatively thanthey did Christians. This might still be due toevaluative ingroup/outgroup distinctions, be-cause Muslims are considered an outgroup byboth German unafÔ¨Åliated persons and GermanChristians. Given that unfavorable attitudestoward religious outgroups are quite prevalent(Jackson & Hunsberger, 1999), it seems possiblethat social identity processes may still have beenrelevant to both groups. Fourth and Ô¨Ånally, withregard to the Ô¨Åndings of Study 3, that Muslimsviewed a terrorist attack as less justiÔ¨Åed if theperpetrators were Christian rather than Muslim,we want to note the potential relevance of his-torical and current inequalities between somecountries that are predominantly Christianversus Muslim in shaping Muslims‚Äô perceptionsof the justiÔ¨Åability of terrorist attacks. Hence, itwould be a fruitful endeavor for future researchto control potential (perceived) historical differ-ences between Muslim and Christian countries,and their effect on perceived justiÔ¨Åability ofaggressive acts.Theoretical and practical implicationsBecause implicit theories are used to interpretand evaluate the social world (e.g. Hong et al.,2001), guide social judgments, and inform socialactions (e.g. Levy, 1999; Levy et al., 2001), theseresults might have important implications forunderstanding and social interaction betweenthe Islamic and Western Christian world: theWestern Christian world assumes Muslims to bemore aggressive than Christians, and therefore tobe more supportive of terrorism than Christians.As a consequence, Muslims might be regardedas potential aggressors threatening the Westernworld, which would lead to oppressive actionsand preventive decisions such as military inter-ventions (e.g. the war in Iraq, 2003, or the war inAfghanistan, 2001), economic embargoes (e.g.Iraq, 1991 to 2003) or interdictions of Islamicsymbols (e.g. the interdiction of head scarvesof Muslim women in German schools). Conse-quently, Muslims interpret such actions by theWestern Christian sphere to be a threat to theirreligious identity, which results in a differentattitude toward terrorism. This, in turn, conÔ¨Årmsimplicit opinions and stereotypes that Westernpeople hold regarding Muslims, and results infurther encroachments and restrictive actionsagainst Muslims and Islamic countries. Thisline of thought illustrates how (unjustiÔ¨Åed) im-plicit theories about Muslims could lead to a self-fulÔ¨Ålling prophecy (e.g. Madon, Jussim & Eccles,1997; Rosenthal & Jacobson, 1968), maintainingor even intensifying a vicious circle. In order tobreak through this circle, the Western worldshould avoid threatening Muslims‚Äô religiousidentity. For instance, it should be communicatedthat military interventions to Ô¨Ånd terrorists (e.g.the Afghanistan war) are not meant to impairMuslims‚Äô religious or cultural identity. To con-clude, the present results suggest that it is im-portant for Western Christian society to criticallyquestion its own stereotypic beliefs about Muslimsin order to promote a better understanding andharmony between cultures.Note1. Please note also that 15‚Äì20 years ago, Christiansin Ireland were using terrorism on a frequentFischer et al.muslims and terrorismbasis as a political instrument. We investigatedonly perceptions and stereotypes of religiousgroups, and do not propose that attitudes towardterrorism are indeed speciÔ¨Åc to acertain religion or religious orientation.ReferencesAhmed, S.
