Each time the govern-ment took steps to execute the Mabira project, civil society groups or-ganised large-scale protests that pressurised the government into shelvingits plans. The Save Mabira Forest campaign has been widely cited as anexample of how sustained protests by civil society groups serve as acorrective of democratic deficits in decision-making processes pertainingto the commons and as a deterrent to profit-driven business schemeshatched in collusion with carefree or corrupt bureaucrats and politicians.However, an in-depth analysis of the campaign suggests that ecologicaland social justice concerns are mixed up with identity politics and exclu-sionist agendas. Examining the complex web of interactions betweenstate, big business and civil society in Uganda, this paper sheds light onthe multi-layered and often ambiguous role played by non-governmentalorganisations in post-conflict societies of sub-Saharan Africa.Manuscript received 11 November 2013; accepted 21 May 2014Keywords: Uganda, civil society, protest movements, racism, natureconservation, deforestation, commonsPatrick Hönig holds a PhD from the University of Cologne and anLLM from Columbia University School of Law.

However, as Polackand others (2013: 1-7) have noted, large-scale acquisition of land bytransnational companies operating in Africa continues to occur with“minimal consultation and transparency”. There are significant researchgaps in the way long-term effects of land allotment for agro-industrialuse are assessed, which in turn leads to less stringent risk assessment.Authors such as Muna Ndulo (2011) have convincingly shown that theadoption of neoliberal policies in aid-dependent countries of sub-Sa-haran Africa has created a political climate that allows corporations topush through their agendas, sometimes even at the cost of violating legalstandards and human rights. At the same time, there is growing recogni-tion that civil society groups in sub-Saharan Africa have started to assertthemselves at the policy-making level and fill a governance void left bystates prepared to delegate their responsibilities (Opoku-Mensah 2008).Against that background, governance of the commons has become animportant area in which opposing interests play out and clash.Pointing to governance as the core problem of dealing with thecommons, Elinor Ostrom (1990: 8-18) observes that there is a wide spec-trum of opinions. On one side, analysts have argued that effective man-agement of the commons requires long-term strategies that private actorsadapting to ever-changing market conditions are ill-equipped to bring tofruition. Ostrom notes that this school of thought sees no alternative tostate institutions applying coercive force in governing the commons.Meanwhile, those at the other end of the spectrum claim that it is neces-sary to eliminate all public control and establish unconditional propertyrights regimes over divisible common pool resources such as land. Theramifications of the various positions, including Ostrum’s own viewpointthat builds on the notion that “many solutions exist to cope with manydifferent problems”, will need to be discussed elsewhere. For the pur-poses of this paper, it will suffice to note that there has been considera-ble research into developing models of governance in areas of limitedstatehood, centring on the structural and political conditions in whichpower is generated and decisions are formed (Risse 2011). Academicwriting has moved beyond binaries pitting state against non-state actors.Using the Save Mabira Forest (SMF) campaign in Uganda as a casestudy, this paper seeks to make an empirical contribution to the largelytheoretical discussion about the nature of the state and civil society insub-Saharan Africa and the processes of political decision-making. It will(a) present an account of the Mabira Forest project and the rationaleCivil Society and Land Use Policy in Uganda55behind it; (b) describe the components and triggers of the Save MabiraForest campaign; (c) explain the crisis of the state in Uganda; (d) discussthe ramifications of civil society movements; and (e) link the empiricalfindings to the discourse on governing the commons. The engagementwith media reports and scholarly work is balanced by background inter-views on the functioning of civil society that I conducted in Uganda andneighbouring countries during field trips in five consecutive years start-ing in 2008.1The Mabira Forest ProjectIn early 2007, the Ugandan government announced that it would dega-zette and clear one-quarter of Mabira Central Forest Reserve – the larg-est nature reserve in Central Uganda – and give the land to the SugarCorporation of Uganda Ltd (SCOUL), jointly owned by a private in-vestor and the Ugandan state, to cultivate sugarcane. Ugandan PresidentYoweri Museveni justified this decision on the grounds that the countryneeded to expand its agricultural and industrial sectors, create incentivesfor foreign direct investment and boost the economy.2 A letter that thepresident had allegedly written to MPs of his party was leaked to thepress, presumably by his own office. In the letter, the authenticity ofwhich the presidency never confirmed or denied, Museveni gave a three-fold explanation for the proposed leasing out of Mabira land. First, heargued that granting land to SCOUL would create jobs. Second, hemaintained that the success of the country’s economy depended on theUgandan Asian business community, which had been expelled under IdiAmin and the reinstatement of which had been a central concern of hisgovernment from the beginning. Third, he claimed that in order forbusinesses in Uganda to compete with China, India and other developingcountries, they had to lower costs and expand. In the case at hand, forest12As the Mabira Forest issue is considered sensitive and there is increasing appre-hension about a government clamp-down on critical civil society organisationsand media, I have not revealed the identity of my interlocutors in civil societycircles.Listing infrastructure development, agricultural production and employment asnational priorities, the website of the Ugandan presidency cites a number ofmodel projects; however, there is no mention of the government plans for Ma-bira Forest. See State House of Uganda, online: <http://www.statehouse.go.ug/national-priorities> (21 March 2014).56Patrick Hönigland had to be given away, according to the president, as no other landwas available.3Museveni’s line of argument follows a neoliberal logic holding thatwhat is good for business is good for the country. There appears to beno place in his thinking for the concerns of local communities, which areso vital for sustainable development centred on the protection of thecommons. Baden and Stroup (1977: 235) sum up the tension resultingfrom the impossibility of quantifying the value of using the commons fornon-extractive purposes as follows: “We know, for example, how muchpeople are willing to sacrifice for a thousand board feet of lumber, buthow much would they pay for a day’s access to a wilderness area?” TheUgandan government’s path dependency explains why it is unwilling toconsider leaving Mabira Forest alone, for no other reason than preserv-ing an untouched part of nature.Countering such criticism, the Ugandan government has argued thatthe part of Mabira Forest being allocated to private concession eitherdoes not belong to the natural forest or belongs to a degraded part of it.However, the government has not addressed reports indicating thatillegal logging is being carried out alongside the logging for which con-cession has been granted. In 2012, sources on the ground informed thattwenty lorry loads of illegally logged timber were being hauled fromMabira on a weekly basis.4 Even if the extent of illegal logging is hard toverify independently, it is difficult to deny that it is indeed happening.Satellite images of Mabira Forest, taken periodically from 1972 to 2003,show a significant decrease of forest cover in the area (Lung and Schaab2008: 28). Any further deforestation is likely to irreparably damage anecosystem already under stress. Deborah Baranga (2007: 2) claims thatuncontrolled exploitation and illegal timber extraction pose a majorthreat to Mabira Forest, which is why there is a need to investigate thecurrent activities in the reserve and their effect on its conservation status.In this section, we have seen that the Ugandan government advo-cates the handover of Mabira forest land to a private company, a market-oriented tactic. In the next section, we will discuss why civil society or-ganisations (CSOs) are campaigning for a state-driven approach to gov-34Felix Osike and Mary Karugaba, Why I Support Mabira Give-Away: Museveni,in: New Vision, 18 April 2007, online: <www.newvision.co.ug news="" 495386-<br="">why-i-support-mabira-give-away-%C3%A2-museveni.html> (21 March 2014).Gerald Tenywa, Mabira Forest Destruction Continues, in: New Vision, 9 January2012, online: <www.newvision.co.ug news="" 628233-mabira-forest-destruction-co<br="">ntinues.html> (21 March 2014).Civil Society and Land Use Policy in Uganda57erning the commons, namely the retention of government control overforest land.The Save Mabira Forest CampaignThe Save Mabira Forest (SMF) campaign has gained international visi-bility for opposing the Ugandan government and questioning its stanceon governing the commons. The decision to allow SCOUL to take over7,100 hectares of Mabira Forest met with bitter resistance on the part ofa cross-section of public institutions, political actors and CSOs. Moreawkwardly, even the heads of the National Environment ManagementAgency (NEMA) and the National Forestry Authority (NFA) rejectedthe government proposals as ecologically imprudent, arguing that theenvironmental impact of cutting trees in an area more than twenty timesthe size of Central Park in Manhattan was likely going to be significant(Price 2007). The NFA executive director, and later the entire board,resigned over the Mabira issue, citing political interference.The SMF campaign soon turned into a mass mobilisation of unprec-edented scale, pitting the Ugandan government against a range of CSOs,international donors, the political opposition, the Buganda kingdom andsignificant segments of civil society. Museveni eventually shelved his plansfor Mabira Forest but put the issue back on the political agenda in Au-gust 2011, a few months after winning his fourth term in office andcementing his two-and-a-half-decade-long hold on power. As had hap-pened in 2007, a network of civil society groups launched a campaign forthe preservation of Mabira Forest. The campaign gathered momentumwhen young Ugandans started using social networking sites like Face-book and Twitter to organise, among other things, nature walks in theforest, which, at approximately 50 km from Kampala and 20 km fromJinja, is easy to reach, even by public transport. In September 2011, Ma-hendra Mehta, the head of Mehta Group, was quoted as saying that hewas no longer interested in acquiring part of the Mabira Forest for sug-arcane growing.5 Tensions eased, but the calm again proved deceptive.At a party retreat in January 2013, without prior indication, Muse-veni announced that he would follow through on his plans for Mabira.The announcement prompted a swift response from the “Save MabiraCrusade”, an umbrella group made up of CSOs, local communities, con-5John Njoroge, I’m Not Interested in Mabira: Mehta, in: Daily Monitor, 3 Septem-ber 2011, online: <www.monitor.co.ug news="" national="" -="" 688334="" 1229602="" bj<br="">s08mz/-/index.html> (21 March 2014).58Patrick Hönigservation bodies and public-interest lawyers. Beatrice Anywar, an oppo-sition politician who is perceived as the figurehead of the movement,went on record saying that the government would not be allowed todivert attention from the challenges the country was facing, and the fightfor Mabira Forest would continue.6Ugandan researchers and international observers have interpretedthe massive show of support for the anti-deforestation campaign as asign of growing civil society assertiveness in a country with a history ofauthoritarian regimes and political repression. Bashir Twesigye (2008: 7)expressed the view that the Mabira advocacy campaign reflected in-creasing environmental awareness and the determination of the Ugandanpeople to oppose misguided government policies. In line with liberalstreams of analysis, Keith Child (2009: 241) called the SMF campaign a“powerful demonstration” of how civil society movements with a limitedagenda may transform themselves into platforms that put forward “moreradical demands for democratic accountability”. Similarly, Aili Tripp(2010: 105) wrote that the response to the cutting down of trees in Ma-bira Forest was a showcase of how civil society in sub-Saharan Africahad woken up to the challenges that threaten human survival, notablythe protection of the environment.However, the opposition against the Mabira Forest project is nomonolithic bloc. Even though it is widely portrayed as the outcome ofconcerted action against pro-business land use policies, the SMF cam-paign is composed of a variety of groups whose mandates overlap andwhose interests conflict. The first pillar of the SMF campaign consists ofa cluster of environmental groups, which argue that the conversion offorest land into a sugarcane plantation will spell environmental disasterfor its adverse effects on biodiversity, fresh water supply, soil fertility andcarbon reduction, harming ecotourism in the process.7 Building on agrowing movement for the preservation of forests in Africa, the lateNobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai argued that participatory67Mercy Nalugo and Solomon Arinaitwe, Activists Dare Museveni, in: Daily Monitor,15 January 2013, online: <www.monitor.co.ug news="" national="" mabira--activ<br="">ists-dare-Museveni/-/688334/1665636/-/item/1/-/g2s0s0/-/index.html> (21March 2014).Chain Reaction: The National Magazine of Friends of the Earth Australia (2013),Ugandan Activists Regroup to Protect Mabira Forest, 117, 9; National Association ofProfessional Environmentalists (2011), Mabira Petition to President Yoweri KagutaMuseveni of Uganda, online: <www.redd-monitor.org 2011="" 08="" 31="" can-redd-pr<br="">otect-the-mabira-forest-in-uganda> (21 March 2014); Nature Uganda (2013),Mabira Forest Should Not Be Sacrificed for Sugar Production, online: <http://natureuganda.org/save_mabira_campaign.php> (21 March 2014).Civil Society and Land Use Policy in Uganda59tree-planting programs in developing countries were an “importantmechanism to support responsible global warming mitigation efforts”(2009: 257). Moreover, Mabira Forest constitutes an important catch-ment area and its partial deforestation will further diminish fresh watersupplies to Lake Kyoga and the Victoria Nile. Lake Victoria, the biggestwater reserve in the Great Lakes region, has already seen a steady declinein water levels over the years, contributing to a hazardous concentrationof toxic substances, which in turn has jeopardised the survival of thelake’s fishing industry. Any further deforestation will also adversely affectbiodiversity in Mabira Forest, which, according to a detailed study byDavenport and others (1996: 4), is home to 71 restricted-range species ofbirds, butterflies and moths. Furthermore, some environmentalists claimthat cutting down one-fourth of the Mabira Forest will translate into aloss of USD 316 million worth of UN-certified carbon credit.8The SMF campaign has drawn further support from a range of left-ist groups, which oppose international investment in agro-industrialbusiness in developing countries on economic and ideological grounds.According to these groups, the idea that business companies adopt strat-egies that keep society’s best interests in mind has been discredited inlight of neo-liberal policies that consider community land as a commod-ity for sale. Samir Amin (2010), a staunch critic of the Washington con-sensus, asserts that subjecting land to the “law of the market” uprootspeople and, contrary to the arguments of supporters of privatisationpolicies, exacerbates poverty. While the use of forest reserve land foragro-industrial purposes does not in itself lead to displacement, it nev-ertheless forms part of an economic paradigm that comes to its logicalconclusion in what Amin calls the “destruction of the peasant societies”,which he believes is a major cause of the pauperisation of the ThirdWorld. In a study on the impact that the Mabira project has had on pov-erty alleviation, Zommers and others (2012: 190-192) conclude that be-fore expanding sugarcane production into forest reserves, the Ugandangovernment will act responsibly only if it carefully evaluates the im-portance of ecosystem services to local livelihood, which so far it hasfailed to do. More generally, Mabira activists may draw support fromarguments developed by thinkers such as Rob Gray, who argues thatcorporations are a force against social justice. The logic behind suchthinking is that corporations are pursuing the goal of maximising wealth8Mubatsi Asinja Habati, Mabira: No Storm in Mehta’s Tea Cup, in: The Independent(Kampala), 26 August – 1 September 2011, 18-20, online: <www.independent.co.ug/news/news-analysis/4550-mabira-no-storm-in-mehtas-tea-cup> (21 March2014).60	
Patrick Hönigfor shareholders, who, as they are becoming increasingly wealthy, opposethe concept of material redistribution, which lies at the heart of socialjustice (Gray 2013: 162-163). Therefore, for left-leaning anti-povertycampaigners, Mabira is an open-and-shut case.The third plank on which the Mabira protest rests is composed of arainbow coalition of watchdog groups that base their criticism on a vari-ety of concerns, including corruption charges. The Advocates Coalitionfor Development and Environment (ACODE), for instance, lamentsthat the government has failed to invite offers from Mehta’s businesscompetitors or call for tender.9 The waters are further muddied by thefact that the land deal with Mehta Group is far from transparent. Thereis no information about how the Ugandan exchequer stands to benefitfrom the proposed transaction. The media is rife with speculation thatonce the land deal is complete, the government will part with its 30 percent stake in SCOUL, for a price, leaving in charge Mehta Group, abusiness conglomerate that operates in four continents and holds assetsin excess of USD 400 million.10 Unsurprisingly, a recent policy briefinglisted the envisaged sale of forest land in Mabira as one of several exam-ples of how the ruling coalition in Uganda is being bought off by bigbusiness (Kjær and Katusiimeh 2012: 27). In terms of social acceptance,it does not help that SCOUL is the least productive of the three majorsugar producers in Uganda and reportedly incurring substantial losses.The fourth tributary to the SMF campaign is made up by supportersof the Kabaka, the king of Buganda, who believes the forest is part of“Buganda land” and should be preserved in its entirety. It is important torecall that Museveni’s capture of power in 1986 is largely seen as theresult of his alliance with the Buganda movement, which supported hisarmed struggle originating in Central Uganda, where many Baganda live.Due to disagreements over the question of “federo”, at the core ofwhich lies the restoration of dignity and autonomy to the kingdom ofBuganda, apart from administration and ownership of land, the relationsbetween President Museveni and Kabaka Ronald Mutebi II were consid-910Mubatsi Asinja Habati, Interview: Museveni Shouldn’t Be Mehta Spokesman, in:The Independent (Kampala), 26 August – 1 September 2011, 8, online: <www.independent.co.ug/column/interview/4554-museveni-shouldnt-be-mehta-spokesman>(21 March 2014).The Mehta Group website shows SCOUL as already being part of its businessassets. See Mehta Group, online: <www.mehtagroup.com> (21 March 2014). In2012, the news broke that a development finance institution had agreed a USD 23million loan to SCOUL to help boost the company’s performance.

That was before the Kabaka was prevented from visitingKayunga district, located in his kingdom, which led to the Buganda riotsin 2009, and the destruction, in mysterious circumstances, of the Kasubitombs, the burial ground of the Kabaka dynasty and a UNESCO worldheritage site, in March 2010. After that it has not been possible for thisauthor to find anyone willing to comment openly on the nature of therelationship between the president and the Kabaka of Buganda. In pri-vate conversation, however, observers close to the Buganda movementsuggest that Museveni might be using the Mabira Forest issue to showthe Kabaka his place, which further raises suspicion about the existenceof hidden agendas.In sum, the SMF campaign draws its significance both from an ar-ticulation of a rainbow coalition of civil society voices in a public dis-course centred on government action, and from serving as an example ofa social movement that breaks with the tradition of party movements,from which the current multi-party system in Uganda has developed. Abrief overview of the history of engagement with the idea of the state inthe postcolonial world, and the concept of civil society within andaround it, will help place the SMF campaign on the matrix of politicalpractices in the governance context of sub-Saharan Africa.State Crisis in UgandaThe Mabira Forest agitation is one of only a handful of political cam-paigns that have been able to attract interest and support from largesegments of the Ugandan public over a period of several years. The suc-cess of the SMF campaign, as well as its shortcomings, will not be easilyunderstood unless placed in the context of a debate on the state and itsdecline in sub-Saharan Africa. After its independence in 1962, Ugandawitnessed short-lived coalition governments, single-party rule, Idi Amin’styranny and a series of wars that ended with the takeover of power byMuseveni and his National Resistance Army in 1986. Some authors havedescribed the Uganda of the 1990s as a country that, unlike the Demo-cratic Republic of the Congo, had pulled itself back from the brink of a“failed state” and managed to break through the logic of violent conflictto initiate processes of “negotiation and rebuilding” (Bayart et al. 1999: 5;Crawford 2004: 47). Such a reading of Ugandan history tends to down-play the disastrous consequences of the civil war of the 1980s and thesignificant fallout from the subsequent war in northern Uganda thatpitted troops loyal to the government against the Holy Spirits Movement62Patrick Hönigled by Alice Lakwena and, later, the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) un-der suspected war criminal Joseph Kony. Moses Khisa (2013: 201) ar-gues that what gave rise to the current conception of the state in Ugandacan be traced to the trauma of prolonged tyranny and civil war that re-sulted, first, in a pronounced urge for minimum stability and personalsecurity among the population at large, and, second, in a strong beliefamong the ruling elites that militaristic methods of managing society willpay off.Soon after taking over power, Museveni was faced with a militarythreat to his leadership and a budget crisis exacerbated by increasingmilitary expenditures. He responded by performing a U-turn from non-aligned rhetoric and, under pressure from the Bretton Woods institu-tions, embraced neoliberal reforms through structural adjustment pro-grammes. Uganda adopted policies of market liberalisation, privatisationand deregulation, and started to downsize its civil service and roll backthe state generally. The implementation of such measures required apolitical rigidity that contradicted the call for “liberalisation” in any senseother than economic and flew in the face of civil society’s requests fordemocratic consultation and accountability. An authoritarian streak soonaccompanied Uganda’s transition to free-market politics (Crawford 2004:42; Olukoshi 2007: 18). Museveni’s acceptance of the neoliberal straight-jacket imposed by the Washington Consensus made him a regional “donordarling” and gave him considerable leeway to consolidate his power at theexpense of competitive politics. This may well have reinforced his “per-sonalistic politics” and stifled the emergence of a legitimate oppositionstrong enough to challenge him in free and fair elections (Hesselbein et al.2006: 30; Mamdani 1994: 557). The results are plain to see. The 2006presidential elections were reduced to a contest between Museveni and hismain rival Kizza Besigye. Upon his return to Uganda from exile in 2005,Besigye had first been held on charges of treason and rape, then, when hemoved to apply for bail, on charges of terrorism (Oloka-Onyango2006: 43). Although Besigye eventually stood in the elections, the impactof the allegations against him probably doused his chances of winningbefore his campaign could take off.In the lead-up to presidential elections in 2011, Sabiti Makara (2010:91) warned that there was little to indicate a shift from the deeply-rooted“reluctance to promote and deepen multiparty democracy” in Uganda.As an example, Makara cited the role of the Electoral Commission,which he said was widely suspected to be catering to the wishes of theruling party. Others echoed such scepticism about the democratic cre-dentials of the Ugandan polity. Olive Kobusingye (2010: 193) stated thatCivil Society and Land Use Policy in Uganda63Uganda was committed to “perpetual electioneering”. While acknowl-edging that elections were welcomed with great excitement when theNational Resistance Movement came to power, she argued that the sheenof elections had worn off over time. In her view, elections can no longerbe considered a means of choosing a leader of the people’s choice.11 Con-cern over securitisation, de-politicisation and erosion of democratic proce-dures is routinely expressed in conversations about the state of affairs inUganda.Ugandan civil society groups, such as Advocates Coalition for De-velopment and Environment and Human Rights Network Uganda, havebeen consistent in their criticism of a wide range of government policies.Human Rights Watch (2010, 2011) published a report on intimidationand harassment of the media in Uganda, followed by another on thepractice of torture and illegal detention by Uganda’s Rapid ResponseUnit. On the 2011 elections, the<ref> European Union Election ObservationMission (2011: 5-7) noted that the electoral process had been “marred byavoidable administrative and logistical failur</ref>es”, leading to the disen-franchisement of an “unacceptable number of Ugandan citizens”.12 Em-boldened by the 2011 election results, Museveni started clamping downon the political opposition with renewed vigour. Tellingly, the massivepolice crackdown on the “walk-to-work” campaign, which the politicalopposition had organised in Kampala to protest rising living expenses,coincided with the democratic uprising in a variety of capitals in NorthAfrica and West Asia.Before long, the debate had focused on whether Uganda could bedescribed as a neopatrimonial state, which Paul Williams (2011: 56) hascharacterised as hybrid, unstable and shot through with streaks of au-thoritarianism. However, the limitations of the neopatrimonial label, auniversal catch-all classification, soon became apparent. State featuresdiffer from region to region, and it cannot be said that every state that ishybrid is unstable or that every state that is unstable is authoritarian innature. Against that background, Erdmann and Engel (2007: 104-105)argue that neopatrimonialism may offer a useful lens through which toconceptualise the state, as long as the definition is not so broad that it1112Olive Kobusingye being the sister of opposition leader Kizza Besigye does notin itself detract from the quality of her analysis.The findings of the mission include violation of the principle of equality of thevote, “inadequate safeguards against fraud” in the drawing up of a nationalvoter register, “distribution of money and gifts by candidates, especially fromthe ruling party”, significantly greater access of candidates of the ruling party tothe media, and a lack of “police impartiality”.64Patrick Hönigloses all meaning. Providing an in-depth analysis of the literature, theyconsider the “invasion” of informal politics and personal relations intothe formal structures of legal-rational reasoning as the core element ofthe neopatrimonial state. In other words, some features of the formal-bureaucratic Weberian state continue to function, while others are beingeroded and fall prey to competing networks of informal power. Similarly,Daniel Bach (2012: 35, 44) observes that the concept of neopatrimonialrule has become equated with predatory, anti-developmental and person-alised power, while regulated forms of power have been overlooked orside-tracked. It makes sense to view the essence of neopatrimonialism notin the usurping by individuals of power assigned to constitutional organs,but in the mixing of competing layers of decision-making, formal andinformal, resulting in erratic functioning of state institutions and clashes ofpower formations with unpredictable outcomes. The way decisions on theMabira Forest have been made and revoked in a haphazard and incoherentway, without any procedures being followed, fits this definition of neopat-rimonialism.Meanwhile, the launch of structural adjustment programmes de-vised by Bretton Woods institutions since the 1980s has been accompa-nied by talk of the informal state, the predatory state, the shadow state oreven the vampire state. According to Khisa (2013: 212), Uganda presentsan interesting departure from the phenomenon of shadow states that relyon clandestine economy networks amidst collapsing state institutions.Khisa argues that the defining feature of the state in Uganda is donorisa-tion, the result of which is the emergence of a CSO economy fuelled byWestern aid and loans. While the state is stripped of many of its corefunctions, CSOs are being given extensive mandates to implement edu-cation, infrastructure, environment protection and health care pro-grammes. Such analysis ties in with left-leaning criticism of the disman-tling of the state by free market forces. Achille Mbembe (2001: 74-75)recalls that the “African crisis” of the 1980s originated from the stateplacing excessive demands on the economy. Based on the argument thatrecovery from such crisis depended on strengthening free market forces,measures were put in place to restrict state intervention in the economywithout introducing safeguards in key sectors such as health, educationand protection of the environment. Predictably, the results were not allpositive. For example, Uganda’s draconian “anti-homosexuality act”,which has received strong support from evangelist groups based in theUnited States, shows that pro-business strategies in line with policiesformulated by Bretton Woods institutions do not necessarily translateCivil Society and Land Use Policy in Uganda65into a liberal vision for society.13 The changing dynamics in the interac-tion of state and civil society actors will be at the centre of the followingsection.Ascendency of Civil SocietyOne section of the literature believes that the only way to fix the brokenstate, neopatrimonial or otherwise, is to develop strategies to stop theerosion of state legitimacy, preferably by involving informal CSO coali-tions, watchdog groups and informed citizens. Informed citizens andwatchdog groups formed by such citizens are regarded as an embattledbut important safeguard for democratic institution-building in Uganda, acorrective to policies devised by authoritarian regimes (Kasfir 1999).Recalling that none of Africa’s newly established multi-party regimeshave abandoned presidential for parliamentary rule, Nicolas van de Walle(2012: 121) considers the curtailing of presidential prerogatives throughmechanisms of vertical and horizontal accountability to essentially be atask incumbent on democratic movements emerging from authoritariantraditions. Broadening the frame of analysis beyond national borders,Andreas Godsäter (2013: 68) asserts that, for the sake of legitimate andeffective resource governance, African governments will need to engagewith wider social layers and popular forces within civil society, enhancecooperation at the regional level, and adopt environmental rules andregulations governing cross-border relations. From an international rela-tions perspective, Ulrich Beck (1999: 17) compares civil society move-ments to a “world party” that places “globality at the heart of politicalimagination, action and organisation” and appeals “to human values andtraditions in every culture and religion”. Beck also feels that naming-and-shaming campaigns by civil society organisations are promising tools topersuade corporations to comply with international law and corporatesocial responsibility schemes.However, mass protest and anti-government agitation are easilyconfused with democratic resilience and political vision. Explaining theuniformly positive portrayal of African civil society in northern policy-making circles as a product of cultural bias, Thomas Kelley (2011: 993-994) points out that people and institutions in the Global North typically13Sexual Minorities Uganda, a Kampala-based NGO, has documented a sharp risein violence, threats and discriminatory practices against lesbian, gay, bisexual,transgender and intersex people following the passage of the act in December2013.66Patrick Hönigpicture African non-governmental organisations (NGOs) as spaces ofdemocratic decision-making that will pass rights-based resolutions ad-vancing “environmental justice, freedom of expression, due process, andthe rule of law”, when in fact many of these NGOs have visions of a justsociety diverging radically from those nurtured by actors in northerncountries. Taking a similarly sober position on the capacity or willingnessof CSOs to advance liberal agendas, Hovil and Okello (2011: 336) re-mind us that civil society groups, like state agents, are susceptible tousurping authority that they cannot legitimately claim and act as “anticor-ruption czars”, while replicating the “behaviour of despots”. ConsideringCSOs as the last line of defence against state suppression and the guard-ian angels of constitutional values – irrespective of their sometimes con-tradictory views and ideological aberrations – makes it all the more diffi-cult to detect where they contradict what they preach and operate on thesame lack of internal democracy, transparency and gender equality as thestate actors they find reason to criticise.Mindful of the political economy of civil society activity, anothersegment of the literature takes a more critical approach and makes apoint of analysing the organisational capacity of watchdog groups to liveup to their mission statements, measuring rhetoric against performance.Playing out in variations, these observers argue that CSOs in semi-authoritarian sub-Saharan African countries may be well-meaning but areconfused about their mandate, alienated from their constituencies, givento believing in the power of just talking, weakened by infighting and co-opted by either the state or international donors (Barr et al. 2005: 664-665; Omona and Mukuye 2013; Opoku-Mensah 2008: 80-83; Tripp2010: 30). Shedding light on the structural constraints of civil societyactivism, Miller and others (2013: 136) have noted that CSOs are perma-nently trapped between “a desire to enhance community well-being andan inability to shape the context in which to do so”. Even where a conten-tious civil society has emerged – “strong, well networked and capable ofproposal as well as protest” – independent decision-making is constantlyimperilled by a shortage of funds and the need for CSOs to operate in anational context governed by laws and regulations that have a bearing ontheir activities (ibid. 141-143). This seam of research offers explanationsfor why civil society movements, particularly in Africa, tend to be eclec-tic and short-lived; however, it fails to explain why protests erupt whenthey do and why people give their time and money to campaigns whenthey have no reassurance that they will receive anything in return.A third strand of analysis, following a neo-realist line of reasoning,is sceptical of the value of democratic governance and the role of civilCivil Society and Land Use Policy in Uganda67society within it. Michael Ignatieff (2005: 69) claims that four decades of“post-colonial misrule” in sub-Saharan Africa have proven that Africansthemselves do not know what kind of governance works for them. Headds that the regimes that have made the “best fist of a difficult situa-tion” have been those in countries such as Uganda, which are “neitherliberal nor democratic but simply have relatively farsighted and honest, ifauthoritarian, leadership”. Alex Thomson (2010: 232) describes a notice-able trend towards chaos and disintegration of existing power structuresas the flipside of civil society ascendancy in the post-colonial Africanstate. This is the context in which we need to place Dambisa Moyo’scontroversial call for a “decisive benevolent dictator” in aid-dependentAfrica, where leaderships demand nothing from the public at large andare not required to give anything in return (Moyo 2010 [2009]: 42).However, if solutions are sought from centralised decision-making, ra-ther than the building of consensus around diverse voices, civil societygroups will hardly be considered as significant, or even useful, players inthe larger scheme of things. Buying into this logic, the Ugandan govern-ment maintains that CSOs are not to be trusted because they are fundedby “the West” and also because they are opposition parties in disguise,bent on defaming the country (Human Rights Watch 2012: 20).The next section examines the question of how the racial overtonesof the agitation impact the conceptualisation of civil society in Ugandaand the framing of the debate on Mabira Forest.Governing the CommonsAs discussed earlier, the Mabira Forest movement does not result from asingle concern shared by all. Rather, it is fed by a wide range of groupswith agendas as complex and multi-layered as Ugandan society itself.Cutting across debates on development, social justice and environmentalprotection, the Mabira Forest case serves as a magnifying glass underwhich an array of problems pertaining to resource management comeinto focus. Whether the SMF campaign is cited as an example of civilsociety resistance to government folly or interference in sound policy-making depends largely on the criteria used to evaluate the agitation onits merits. Fischlin and Nandorfy (2012: 89) argue that in devising re-gimes governing the commons, individual rights, such as the right toproperty, need to be balanced against “community rights”; in otherwords, the “rights of community commons to exist and be protected”.At the heart of such a balancing test lies a re-orientation towards anunderstanding of community and rights centring on “interests shaped by68Patrick Hönigthe most basic practices that guarantee sustainable life”, such as food,water, shelter and respect for difference. The conceptual connection ofresource governance and community-building explains the importance ofaddressing the racial overtones of the SMF campaign.From its early days, the Save Mabira agitation provided cover forfree-riders who launched attacks on Ugandan Asians on the rationalethat they were to be collectively held responsible for the business activi-ties of the Indian-owned Mehta group, a transnational corporation thatholds the majority stake in SCOUL. In response to what came to beknown as the “Mabira riots”, Museveni declared that his decision toallocate part of the Mabira Forest to SCOUL was non-negotiable. How-ever, the conclusions he drew from the outbreak of violence were un-convincing. Apart from holding a meeting with the Ugandan Asiancommunity in Kampala, in which he reassured them of governmentprotection, Museveni struck a clearly populist chord, blaming the policefor allowing the demonstration that had led to the casualties, announcingtax breaks for investors and calling for tougher laws on the media.14 Theorganisers of the Mabira protests, on the other hand, claimed their dem-ocratic right to assemble freely and peacefully but failed to decisivelydistance themselves from the violence against Ugandan Asians and drawa line between environmental concern and racism.The repeated outbreak of violence targeting Ugandan Asians sug-gests that, under the guise of ecological and social justice concerns, aband of operators are exploiting popular anxieties and employing divi-sive tactics for political gain. Tensions along ethnic lines had built upgradually under colonial rule and were deliberately exploited by Idi Aminduring his reign of terror from 1971 to 1979. As early as 1972, Aminlaunched an expropriation and expulsion campaign against Asian Ugan-dans on the grounds that they were “sabotaging Uganda’s economy andencouraging corruption” (Manby 2009: 54, 96). Irreconcilable as hispolicies were with international human rights standards, it is perhapsimportant to note that the anti-Asian resentment and the expropriationof their assets and businesses was a safe card to play for Amin as it metwith the approval of significant segments of both the Baganda and theincreasingly influential Nubi-Muslim trading communities who saw theAsian traders as rivals (Hansen 2013: 91).In the 1990s, President Museveni started encouraging foreign in-vestment and, yielding to pressure from donor countries, asked Ugandan14Felix Osike, Museveni Assures Asians, in: New Vision, 19 April 2007, online:<www.newvision.co.ug news="" 495293-museveni-assures-asians.html=""> (21 March2014).Civil Society and Land Use Policy in Uganda69Asians to return and repossess their property. The Economist wrote in1995 that Asians (5,000 lived in Uganda at the time, compared to 70,000before the expulsion, 23,000 of whom were Ugandan citizens) had notlost their image as “cut-throat businessmen”, adding that their “influencein Uganda stretched far beyond their numbers” (The Economist 1995). TheMehta family, which owns the business conglomerate that carries itsname, had been forced to leave the country in the 1970s and returnedonly in the 1990s to reclaim its property. Meanwhile, Museveni’s publicremarks about his personal investment priorities have done little to easeethnic tensions. In an interview with the New African, Museveni said thatforeign investors were more useful to the country than some of its do-mestic ones because they created jobs, paid taxes, bought raw materialsand paid for the electricity they used.15 Such condescension brings backimages of the colonial times. Ugandans have not forgotten that it was ahallmark of the colonial state to introduce crops, decide on the colony’strading partners and clear forests “without any consideration to envi-ronmental or religious importance” (Mueni wa Muiu 2010: 1314).Given the country’s record of violence against Ugandan Asians, it issomewhat surprising that academic writing has tended to ignore thecampaign’s racial undercurrents and the threats they pose for the Ugan-dan polity as a whole. Mahmood Mamdani (2007), himself a Ugandan ofAsian descent, wrote that what had made the leasing of land so explosivewas the collusion between an increasingly unaccountable president whotreated the country as his private preserve, and a tycoon who claimed tobe doing the country a favour while lining his own pockets. Mamdanimaintained that the political opposition had taken advantage of the situ-ation but had not created the issue, omitting any mention of actors whomight have a vested interest in escalating ethnic tensions in Ugandansociety. Bashir Twesigye (2008: 6) stated that protesters had turned onpeople of Indian origin “to demonstrate their disapproval of the Indianowners of Mehta” as if this was an excuse for the violence that unfolded.Keith Child (2009: 251-253) wrote that the attacks on Ugandan Asians ofApril 2007 had drawn condemnation from many of the civil societygroups that helped organise it, which is why analysis of the cause of theagitation and its consequences should be kept separate. However, if weaccept Child’s argument that the Mabira land deal confirms increasingdomination of the country’s economic assets by Indian-controlled com-panies, it seems hard to disassociate the consequences of the agitation15New African, President Museveni: “Development Is the Destination”, 1 Oc-tober 2012, 8, online: <www.newafricanmagazine.com president-museveni-dev<br="">elopment-is-the-destination> (21 March 2014).70Patrick Hönigfrom the ill will towards Ugandan Asians that Child claims is entrenchedin Ugandan society. It is perhaps the desire to brand the SMF campaignas a “symbol of civil society efficacy” that makes it so difficult to recog-nise its racial undercurrents. Our analysis of the SMF campaign showsthat while civil society movements address people’s concerns in rhetoric,	
they may in fact contribute to discursive practices that are rooted inprejudice and aimed at divisive politics along ethnic lines. The Save Ma-bira agitation has potential as a building block for participatory democ-racy only if it owns up to the acts of injustice and the crimes perpetratedin its name.OutlookThe Mabira Forest issue could move in one of several directions. Onestrand of analysis emphasises that, through the results of the 2011 par-liamentary elections, a challenge has arisen to Museveni in the form of a“record number” of parliamentarians belonging to the same party as thepresident but being considerably younger than him (Vokes 2012: 311-312). The argument goes that this young generation of politicians thriveson local support and has challenged the president on a number ofcounts, from ministerial appointments and the draft anti-bail bill (pre-sumably targeting members of the opposition and dissidents) to thedecision to sacrifice part of Mabira Forest for a sugarcane plantation.The<ref> International Crisis Group (2012: 33) considers opposition to theMabir</ref>a project – even from MPs belonging to the National ResistanceMovement, Museveni’s own political party – as one of several promisingsigns for the preparedness of parliamentary democracy to assert its con-stitutional powers.Off the record, however, many analysts admit that they are scepticalabout the longevity of the SMF campaign, given its heterogeneity andlack of vision. They predict that the resistance from a cross-section ofpolitical dissidents and civil society groups will eventually wane, allowingMuseveni and his inner circle to prevail with their plans for Mabira For-est. It has not been lost on observers that Ugandan government rhetoricno longer distinguishes between lawful and unlawful dissent on constitu-tional grounds, but “loyal and disloyal opposition”, as measured by theState House, the seat of the president.16 Government interference is16The distinction between loyal and disloyal opposition was pointed out to theauthor in an informal meeting with a high-ranking government official workingin the presidential office.Civil Society and Land Use Policy in Uganda71particularly grave in scenarios where CSOs operate in sensitive areas orpronounce views on large-scale investment projects such as the oneplanned for Mabira. In a report on the conditions of NGO work inUganda,<ref> Human Rights Watch (2012: 27) observes that organisationscarrying out </ref>research, advocacy, and citizen education on environmentalissues have faced “increasing obstructions” from the government in theform of threats of deregistration, accusations of sabotaging governmentprogrammes, and arrest.There are also indications that government agencies are being stream-lined on controversial issues. Neither the National Environment Man-agement Agency nor the National Forestry Authority makes any refer-ence to the Mabira issue on their respective websites, which is curiousgiven that both initially positioned themselves against the leasing out offorest land to SCOUL. It is clear, therefore, that the Ugandan govern-ment has adopted a flexible approach to handling the Mabira Forestcase, yielding to pressure when it became too strong and pushing for theleasing out of land when it felt that it was in a politically advantageousposition to do so and the campaign had started to come undone. How-ever, even if Museveni gives up on his plans for Mabira Forest, the divi-sive tone used by all stakeholders has introduced a toxic element into thediscourse on development that will take time to diminish.ConclusionsThis paper has attempted to show that since the SMF campaign waslaunched in 2007 in response to plans of the Ugandan government tohand over one-fourth of the forest to a sugar company for cultivation ofsugarcane, it has drawn strength from a network of loosely connectedcivil society groups. Contrary to popular perception, the SMF campaigndoes not constitute a continuous and sustained movement. Instead, itmust be understood as a string of activist spells, each provoked by a per-ceived need to respond to government initiatives to push the agenda onMabira.The paper cites evidence indicating that the government’s case insupport of the Mabira Forest project is weak in terms of substance. Thelack of available data on the impact of agro-industrial investment in Ma-bira is matched by a lack of risk assessment in the planning phase. Inlight of the documentation gap and the resulting margin of error in as-sessing the impact of the proposed development project in Mabira For-est, the case for abandoning the plans of clearing one-fourth of the for-est seems compelling. Even though a solution has remained elusive, the72Patrick HönigSMF campaign is a significant achievement, given the fact that PresidentMuseveni has used tremendous political capital to bulldoze an array ofdissenting voices, not on policy grounds, but by way of declaring a per-sonal “war on sugar”.The paper also challenges the uncritical appraisal of civil societygroups in sub-Saharan Africa as democratic checks to neopatrimonialregimes. Although it is popular strategy among activists to paint politicalcontroversies with a broad brush, the portrayal of land use issues as afight between good and evil creates binaries that are easily exploitable forpurposes of identity politics. Irrespective of whether the Mabira Forestdispute sees business interests or community concerns prevail, the way inwhich racial stereotypes were played up in the campaign reveals a disqui-eting trend towards fragmentation of Ugandan society. In the final analy-sis, the SMF campaign and its ugly underbelly lend credence to claimsfor a widening and deepening of civil society engagement, but also tocalls for a critical reflection of what drives activism, within local commu-nities and across national borders. For civic activism to become an assetfor democratic governance of the commons, however problematic theterm, it will need to focus not only on a campaign agenda but also on avision for an inclusive society.ReferencesAmin, Samir (2010), Millennium Development Goals: A Critique from<ref>the South, in: Pambazuka News, 498, online: <www.pambazuka.org <br="">en/category/features/67326> (21 March 2014).</www.pambazuka.org></ref><ref>Anderson, David M., and Adrian J.

Die Kampagne zur Rettung des Mabira-Waldes wird häufig als Beispiel dafür angeführt, dass ausdauernder Pro-test aus der Zivilgesellschaft als Korrektiv gegen undemokratische Ent-scheidungen über Gemein- oder öffentliche Güter wirken und profitori-entierte Akteure, die mit unbedarften oder korrupten Politikern undBürokraten Geschäfte ausbrüten, abschrecken kann. Eine tiefer gehendeCivil Society and Land Use Policy in Uganda77Analyse der Kampagne offenbart jedoch, dass hier ökologische undsoziale Anliegen mit Partikularinteressen verflochten sind. Der Autoruntersucht das komplexe Interaktionsgeflecht zwischen Staat, Groß-unternehmen und Zivilgesellschaft in Uganda, wirft aber auch einSchlaglicht auf die vielschichtige und teilweise sehr ambivalente Rolle,die Nichtregierungsorganisationen in Post-Konflikt-Gesellschaften dessubsaharischen Afrika spielen.Schlagwörter: Uganda, Zivilgesellschaft, Protestbewegung, Rassismus,Naturschutz, Entwaldung, Allgemeingüter</www.newafricanmagazine.com></www.newvision.co.ug></www.mehtagroup.com></www.indep</www.independent.co.</www.redd-monitor.org></www.monitor.co.ug></www.monitor.co.ug></www.newvision.co.ug></www.newvision.co.ug></hoenig.patrick@gmail.com></www.giga-journal-family.org></www.africa-spectrum.org></iaa@giga-hamburg.de></www.africa-spectrum.org>
