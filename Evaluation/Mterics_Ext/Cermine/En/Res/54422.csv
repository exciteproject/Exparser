Must be understood as a multidimensional and global problem, not restricting tothe relationship between the individual and the consumption of psychoactive substances.1-2This being a social problem, there is a need for government intervention in order toprevent its spread and to promote greater support to these users and their families.3Accordingly, after the Decade of 90, there was the structuring of the network of specificattention to these people, by setting standards and guidelines for the Organization ofservices that provide assistance in mental health, such as the centers of psychosocial care(CAPS), ad CAPS included, for the treatment of users of alcohol and other drugs.4-6Thus, the primary health care strategy in relation to the consumption of alcohol andother drugs is the ad CAPS using harm-reduction strategies as tools in prevention and healthpromotion, particularly by supporting national programme for Integrated CommunityAttention to users of alcohol and other drugs.7Guided by psychosocial model, the ad CAPS are proposed as a space of creativity,life-building, rather than delete, and should receive disciplinary medicalizing, care for andbuild bridges with the society, considering the user in its subjective and socio-culturalimplications, electing him as the protagonist of your treatment.8-9These nurses appears as a great contributor to this process of user assistance, not inisolation, but cooperatively with the other professionals involved.10-11 This study aimed toanalyze the general perception of nurses about assistance to users of alcohol and drugs froma day-care Center. Had specific goals: characterize the nursing assistance directed to usersof the ad CAPS; identify the conduct of work used during the service to users, and describethe difficulties for operationalization of the attention model proposed by ad CAPS.METHODThe study on the screen had the backdrop of the day-care Centre for users of alcoholand other drugs in the city of Sousa, Paraiba. With regard to assistance to mental health,the town has a CAPS III (assistance towards hospitalization short), a CAPS i (assistance tochildren and adolescents), ad CAPS a (service for users of alcohol and other drugs) and twotherapeutic homes, linked to the Municipal Health Secretariat. The ad CAPS has seven yearsJ. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. 2014. dez. 6(supl.):90-10191ISSN 2175-5361Costa IP, Assis LF, Almeida MR, et al.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2014.v6i5.90-101Self-perception of nurses‚Ä¶of working with a team of twenty-seven professionals (psychiatrist, doctor generalpractitioner, psychologist, social worker, nurse, artisan, diplomacy, physical educator,monitors, Cook, administrative officer and general services assistants), and the nursing staffcomposed of three nurses.As for the type it is an exploratory, descriptive study with a qualitative approach.We used a non-probability sample of convenience constituted by 03 nurses who work in theday-care Center alcohol and drugs from the town of Shah-PB. To choose the participantsdelimited as inclusion criteria: being a nurse, be acting in the ad CAPS there are at least 6months and agree to participate in the study through the signing of an informed consent.The data were collected between October and November 2011, through a socio-demographic questionnaire for characterization of participants and a semi-structuredinterview script with the intention of seizing the perception of subjects surveyed providedfor research objectives.Worth pointing out that only one participant allowed to record the interview, otherspreferred to answer the written instrument. The interviews were transcribed in full and,after careful reading, identified concordances in the context, that allowed the grouping oftopics, such as Thematic Content Analysis guides,12 which consists of discovering the nucleiof meaning that make up a communication whose presence or frequency has significance tothe analytic goal targeted.The study complied with the provisions contained in resolution 466/2012 NationalHealth Council-CNS, which deals with research involving humans. Due respect to humandignity requires that all research process after informed consent of the subject individual orgroups by themselves and/or their legal representatives, expressing their consent toparticipation in research. Thereby the research started by the project approval by theResearch Ethics Committee of the State University of Paraiba, under protocol number0513.0.133.000-11.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFrom the socio-economic data obtained in the course of the present research was acharacterization of the participants, while the subjective data were analyzed from ContentAnalysis,12 technique allowing the grouping of topics organized into two categories: thework of nursing; difficulties faced; Organization of the assistance service; interaction withthe family.Characterization of the participants of the surveyStudy participants were characterized as individuals predominantly female, beingtwo women and a man, aged between 28 to 54 years old and with professional training timevarying between 2 and 31 years. The participants of the survey only a specialization.

Nurses are responsible for all activities, bureaucratic-administrative nursing and welfare that can be divided into: individual calls consisting ofnursing consultations (clinical intercurrences), triage, greeting, note and contact withusers, administration and delivery of medication, checking vitals, orientation, nursing care(the patient's evolution, individual therapeutic project); group sessions (groups of healthguidance and proper use of the medication); workshops and family care.The professionals point to the experience and the fact that the team beinterdisciplinary as reason facilitator for the performance of nursing activities, in additionto the autonomy of the ad CAPS, to troubleshoot at all levels of health care users, theavailability of auto, the support of the Municipal Health Secretariat and the direction of theinstitution and the identification with the work area. This can be verified in theTestimonials below:(...) There is an interest of the whole team to get resolutions on theuser, the municipal government help in various matters such asmaterial, structure, there's no shortage of medicines (...) has a caravailable in the unit to go to the user if you did not attend theservice (...) there is a very large support that is given to us thedirection, coordination of mental health and all employees involvedin the process. (P1.)First, I can totally relate to mental health, and especially with thework developed in the ad CAPS, the team is also a big promoter,since we are very united and we work really closely. Anotherimportant factor is the level of professionals; we have enoughtrained professionals on the team, so I learn a lot with them. (P2).Join a team with more experience and multidisciplinary, is veryimportant and very helpful. (P3).Difficulties facedThe difficulties pointed out as obstacles to exercise the nursing work in service arerelated to lack of training/training for professionals working in this area and the absence ofa satisfactory health services assistance (general hospital, outpatient services) users ofalcohol and drugs during the night. When asked whether at some point were qualified towork in ad CAPS and what kind of training, respondents have positioned themselves asfollows:(...) When we arrived in the unit I personally only seen thing of CAPSon paper and little, was only a just class, so when we got here didn'tknow anything about the CAPS and how it would deal with the user(...). (P1).(...) to start the work on this service wasn't qualified, however, inthe period that I started the team attending monthly supervisionproposed by the Ministry of health and it was during theseJ. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. 2014. dez. 6(supl.):90-10193ISSN 2175-5361Costa IP, Assis LF, Almeida MR, et al.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2014.v6i5.90-101Self-perception of nurses‚Ä¶supervisions that many questions about the service were clarified.(P2).There was a training made by the State, the municipal governmentmade a training project and in this capacity she was divided into twoparts, one devoted to mental health was made during the day at thefederal University (...) and the night was a system geared more forthe ad CAPS than would be the ad CAPS. (P3).With respect to lack of assistance during the night period at health services users ofalcohol and drugs, two of the participants emphasized:Most participants referred to the fact that the service is of type II, limits the ducts aswell as the effectiveness of the activities carried out and consider that the ad CAPS or CAPS12:0 am ad III would be a new possibility, qualified and effective assistance. And asalternatives to improve the service, pointed out the need for better organization and hiringmore professionals.The lack of a more intensive care so we could watch the user in amore complex, both during the day and night, for which we had paidattendance during the crisis of abstinence but also during the Detoxphase. Another difficulty is the lack of specific programmes forcrack users, as well as the lack of investments in the training ofprofessionals working in this area. (P1).(...) the ad CAPS is a clinic day, many users pass through the issue ofabstinence and the general hospitals of the city (...) do not want toanswer user (...) we evaluates and administers medication duringthe day, but when it comes to the end of the afternoon send home,he gets the care and suffering of the family (...) it would beinteresting to the creation of the ad CAPS III with ease of access.(P3).(...) We listen to our users on a daily basis the difficulty facing thenight on the streets, especially those who can't stay abstinent andthat require a period to Detox. The ad CAPS II limits theeffectiveness of treatment. Have the ad CAPS III 24 hours would begood, because it would solve the greatest difficulty of users which isthe night. (P1).(...) The ad CAPS II treatment needs to be complemented at the adCAPS III, since there are different stages of treatment. The ad CAPSIII would be for users who require intensive care to undergo adetoxification and the ad CAPS II would continue treatment with thesemi and intensive not user I detoxified and abstinence. (P2).So that we have more effectively and efficiently in the treatmentproposed in the ad CAPS II need a CAPS ad III, as well, hiring moreprofessionals as an occupational therapist and social worker. (P3).The Organization of the assistance serviceIn relation to changes in practices that took place of the psychiatric reform whenasked if this transformation became handicapped assistance, the replies are unanimous instating that there is no lack in connection with the service, but agreed that the change ofstrategies and knowledge benefits users and professionals.J. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. 2014. dez. 6(supl.):90-10194ISSN 2175-5361Costa IP, Assis LF, Almeida MR, et al.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2014.v6i5.90-101Self-perception of nurses‚Ä¶The participants reported being part of a team that acts of interdisciplinary andintersectoral manner.(...) The reform, especially in relation to the users of the ad CAPS(...) Enables a resocialization. (P1).(...) I see a great freedom of thought from the user, a larger rangeof offers treatment options, he stays in the unit because he wants athis interest (...) So in my view this reform of the psychiatricevaluation for the CAPS for users with problems with drugs ad CAPSis the great evolution (...). (P2).(...) Everybody integrates and is part of all (...) on individualtherapeutic project all professionals will be part (...) so without theweekly meetings to discuss the causes and problems of the users,the people would be a bit lost in the treatment (...). (P1).(...) We invite every once in a while someone from a. (...) currentlyalso the Masonic lodge does activities with users (...) the peopleinvites to do lectures teachers from the University, some users withproblems in justice, always maintaining this partnership. We arediscussing the possibility of a law favoring the drug user, who hire adrug user pay less taxes (...) currently sense society has showngreater interest in the person and not the fact that she use drugs ornot. (P3).The nurses had knowledge about the harm-reduction policy and apply it in CAPS,fashion ad not advocated, adopting strategies such as syringe Exchange programs (SEPS),Methadone maintenance programs or with the integration of professional Damage reducersto the community health Agents program (PACS), but running harm reduction encouragingprogressive withdrawal. One can observe this through the following speeches:It's a new way to reducing the harm associated with the use ofpsychoactive drugs by focusing on prevention. However, if we had aprofessional damage reduction would be implemented moreeffectively. (P1).Yes, people use the service damage reduction (...) with the time webegan to understand that these users were an evolutionary process(...) in recovery and any proposal for intervention that make himreduce the amount of drugs they are using is positive (...) the littlethat they can too. (P3).Of the nurses who participated in the research, it might be noted that these do notuse the Systematization of nursing care (SAE) as a way of organizing the assistanceprovided, in accordance with the following lines:At the moment, no. (P1).No (P2)We don't use (...) but makes something a bit similar, whenelaborates the therapeutic project (...) find out what are the issuesthat he presents in all its areas, whether in family problems,unemployment, self-esteem, self-care, relationship with the peoplewho surround (...).

(P1).It is a way to view the user beyond the dependency. (P2).Of the participants surveyed only one believes that SAE does not improve theassistance because it believes this applies better clinical pathologies and not changes ofbehavior and psychological needs.I think so maybe the individual therapeutic project is an adaptationthat we did for the CAPS than would be more like thesystematization of nursing care (...) the therapeutic evaluation ofthe project here is long-term, the systematization as we get moreclinical patients she's kinda developed more to the clinic, suchassistance is kind daily (...) but here the more you go movingsurfacing the issues of psychological area you will see that they aremore in the long run, so this doesn't get daily revaluation (...). (P3).Interaction with the familyIn relation to the family triad-user-professional, participants pointed out benefits ofthis relationship and it was observed that this is of the utmost importance, as you can see inthe following lines:The benefits are when the family accompanies the user, thetreatment is more effective. (P1).Since the founding of the ad CAPS the symbol that we initially usedwas a triangle with three hands, one hand would be the user, otherprofessionals and the third of the family, without the threetreatment doesn't work (...) the family participates enough (...) isalways interested in the treatment of users (...) without theparticipation of her treatment is in half (...) the answer is beingvery positive (...). (P2).Our unit conducts weekly meetings with the family because it is veryimportant to have this family-team interaction. Nursing has greataccess to the user's family, since, in the vast majority, the familyaccompanies the user to medical consultation, but also in thedelivery of medication. It is very important that there is feedbackbetween staff and family. (P3).The vast majority of households have a feeling of revolt with thesituation because they feel that there is nothing more to do for thatuser recovery and that at any moment all come back again, so hisfamily wants to get rid of that problem, sometimes it's somethingeven unconscious (...).(P2).One of the participants shows that the main difficulty in the family relationship withthe user:Is explicit that this service professionals seek to carry out interaction with thefamily, considering it as part of the treatment team as you can see in the followingstatements:(...) as the family begins to understand what's going on, what is ourpolicy and what are the expectations, she spends to help in theJ. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. 2014. dez. 6(supl.):90-10196ISSN 2175-5361Costa IP, Assis LF, Almeida MR, et al.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2014.v6i5.90-101Self-perception of nurses‚Ä¶treatment and understand well the situation, becoming anotherteam to treat the user (...). (P2).(...) We have to keep this family together and following theproposed treatment, showing that you have a recovery time (...).(P3).Generally speaking, you can see through the lines of the nurses that there was amajor breakthrough in assisting those users, but there is still much to be achieved in thisarea, and especially in the institution search. The lack of training and failures in thestructure and dynamics of service compromises the quality of assistance provided. However,to have a team committed to the therapeutic project, with the inclusion of the user in thisprocess is the best way to achieve abstinence, effectively.13The participants emphasize that the interdisciplinarity of the team and intersectoralapproach in the municipality are facilitators for the performance of nursing activities. Thisfact could be perceived through the autonomy demonstrated by professional ad CAPS totroubleshoot at all levels of attention. This result is in line with a study, which found thatthe professionals shared their knowledge and realized the need for training within the workenvironment.14The insertion of the nurse in the ad CAPS seems to be facilitated by the goodrelationship with the multidisciplinary team that has, in terms of interdisciplinarity, theability to absorb the knowledge of nurses and recognize that this is important to the successof the proposed therapy. The interdisciplinary work requires team members to socializetheir roles, providing reduction of hierarchical organization for collective work andegalitarian.15The context evidenced in speech of participants consistent with the opinion of otherstudies by saying that the intersectoral approach must represent an area of knowledgesharing, of structuring new languages, new practices and new concepts. Its construction ispart of a transformative process in plan, perform and evaluate the actions in order topromote a reordering in the implementation of specific manifestations in the set of publicpolicies.16The difficulties pointed out as obstacles to exercise the nursing work in service wererelated to structure and dynamics, as lack of professionals, absence of CAPS and supportservices of empowerment/training. Referred to by professional dissatisfaction about theabsence of qualification confirms with the study that shows that nurses have received littleinformation and training about the context of alcohol and other drugs, which contributes tothe lack of theoretical basis.17 This question deserves highlight by little mobilization ofmanagers to offer appropriate training for professionals who participate in work as specificas that service.With the psychiatric reform it needs professionals in the area of mental health inorder to achieve the necessary quality for watching humanly the user. The knowledgearising from specialization courses or training programs allow nurses a better preparationfor dealing with patients with mental suffering and the possibility of creating new forms ofwork organization, which consider the relationships between users, the team and thecommunity, in addition to become safe and self-critical about their assistance.18J. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. 2014. dez. 6(supl.):90-10197ISSN 2175-5361Costa IP, Assis LF, Almeida MR, et al.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2014.v6i5.90-101Self-perception of nurses‚Ä¶Of the nurses who participated in the survey, could not use the SAE, however,understand the importance of this process and consider that their deployment couldimprove the assistance provided. On this context, the literature states that SAE is vitallyimportant to plan and execute individualized care to the user.9 Nursing processes, linked ornot to theories of nursing, are based on the method of scientific resolution of problems and,therefore, its proposal phases information, the problem definition, the option for a solution,testing it by evaluating their results and trying other solutions if the first has not beensatisfactory.19According to reports, one realizes that the nursing staff uses a therapeutic projectthat meets the unique needs of each subject, in order to ensure that a link in therelationship between nurse-user. Thus, the end compares the individual therapeutic SAEproject, because, in a way, systematizes the ducts and goals for each user with a uniquedifference: there is no diagnostic formulation.All participants agree that the deinstitutionalization was and is a process of changethat offers better expectations and freedom not only for the user, but also to theprofessional. However, point to a flaw that possibly, if well-articulated, could improve notonly the assistance provided, but that would be the deployment of 24 hours CAPS.It was noted further that the family is perceived as co-responsible for the user, butto see him accompanied by CAPS attempts to "abandon" the problem by placing theresponsibility on the team and only on the institution itself. Thus, the professionals reportthat seek to encourage and strengthen this bond with the family focusing on the well-beingof every user.Such a situation consistent with a survey conducted in one of the ad CAPS of MinasGerais in the Southeast region, in which the participation of the family was so effective, notrestricting only the meetings in which they discussed matters about the medication and howto deal with particularities of the disease. In this approach, the family participation withinthe ad CAPS must overcome the role of just object from the actions, but also becomesubject to actions that get involved with the issue in order to promote the process ofreintegration and social rehabilitation, as well as the rescue of their citizenship.20CONCLUSIONThe issues scored in this study demonstrate the importance of the process of changethat happened with the psychiatric reform movement, pointing out that the resocializationand rehabilitation increases the freedom of users and professionals and allow amplepossibilities of interventions that, at the same time, produce care and give visibility to thediverse demands of this population in relation to society. Such interventions should bedesigned in such a way, using intersectoral the concepts of "territory", of "network" andextended logic of harm reduction consistent with the guidelines of the Brazilian psychiatricreform.J. res.: fundam. care. online 2015. 2014. dez. 6(supl.):90-10198ISSN 2175-5361Costa IP, Assis LF, Almeida MR, et al.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2014.v6i5.90-101Self-perception of nurses‚Ä¶The results evidenced here lead to new research, reflections, proposals andattitudes on the part of managers and professionals working in mental health especially inservices geared to warning users of alcohol and other drugs.
