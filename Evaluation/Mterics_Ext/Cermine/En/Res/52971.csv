Writing a love letter to your (perceived) enemy: ThíchNhất Hạnh and the rhetoric of nonviolenceAssociate Professor Michael PHILLIPS-ANDERSONDepartment of Communication, Monmouth UniversityUSAmphillip@monmouth.eduIndependent Scholar Rachel PHILLIPS-ANDERSONUSArach_ander@yahoo.comAbstract: Vietnamese Buddhist monk and peace activist Thích Nhất Hạnh has beena leading figure in the promotion of nonviolent practice throughout the world. Weexamine his concept of engaged Buddhism, theories of nonviolence, and intersec-tions with rhetorical and communication studies. His approach takes nonviolencebeyond the realm of refusing to use physical violence to the recognition that lan-guage itself can be violent. In order to understand this approach we detail the con-cepts of interbeing, loving speech, and deep listening. We examine the role of lovein Nhất Hạnh’s theory of nonviolence, comparing it with approaches taken by Ma-hatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. Examples are given from many of NhấtHạnh’s speeches and writings with particular attention paid to a love letter he wroteto US President George W. Bush during the Iraq War. Thích Nhất Hạnh offers thepractice of writing a love letter to one’s perceived enemy as a means to persuade fora turn to nonviolence.Keywords: nonviolence, rhetoric, Thích Nhất Hạnh, peace, interbeing***L’écriture d’une lettre d’amour à votre ennemi (perçu): Thích Nhất Hạnh et larhétorique de la non-violenceRésumé: Grande maître bouddhiste vietnamien Thích Nhất Hạnh est un militantpacifiste qui occupe une place dominante dans la promotion de la non-violence àtravers le monde.

Buddhist monkand activist Thích Nhất Hạnh’s contribution to theories and practices of nonviolenceextends the concept to the discursive, the cognitive, and the spiritual spheres. Re-lying on the concept of “interbeing” – a Buddhist concept of the interdependence ofall things on one another – Nhất Hạnh explains that seeking to change the worldthrough nonviolence should be practiced in each of these areas. The members of amovement must not only eschew weapons and other forms of physical violence, butalso avoid speech that is harmful. In the sense of interbeing, when we use words offorce, of coercion, we are not only committing violence against those we perceive asour adversaries, but against ourselves as well.Nhất Hạnh is not a rhetorical theorist, but communication is at the heart of hisperspective. What we present is a synthetic rhetorical theory of nonviolence thatarises through his speeches, books, and other writings. In the following sections wewill briefly introduce Nhất Hạnh, discuss several of his key ideas about communica-tion including interbeing, non-attachment to views, and the role of love. Next weconnect his theory to relevant scholarship about nonviolence in rhetorical and com-munication studies. We conclude with an analysis of a love letter sent by Nhất Hạnhto President George W. Bush in response to the Iraq War.1. Thích Nhất Hạnh’s life and ideasBorn in Vietnam in 1926, Thích Nhất Hạnh witnessed firsthand the death anddestruction brought on by war. Much of the 20th Century in Vietnam was marked byinternal conflict and struggles against foreign occupations. Nhất Hạnh entered aBuddhist monastery at 16 and was fully ordained in 1949, at the age of 23. NhấtESSACHESS. Journal for Communication Studies, vol. 10, no. 1(19) / 201775Hạnh quickly emerged as a leader, scholar, and independent thinker within the Viet-namese Buddhist establishment.In 1954, the French lost Vietnam to nationalist forces and the Geneva Accordsdivided the country into North and South. During this time of great internal uphea-val, Nhất Hạnh struggled with how, as an emerging monastic, he should respond tothe division and devastation around him. He coined the term “engaged Buddhism”to describe his integration of contemplative life and social action (Ratner, 2016, p.34). Nhất Hạnh describes how his approach to activism was born out of his personalexperience of violence:When I was in Vietnam, so many of our villages were being bombed.Along with my monastic brothers and sisters, I had to decide what to do.Should we continue to practice in our monasteries, or should we leave themeditation halls in order to help the people who were suffering under thebombs? After careful reflection, we decided to do both—to go out and helppeople and to do so in mindfulness. We called it engaged Buddhism.Mindfulness must be engaged. Once there is seeing, there must be acting.… We must be aware of the real problems of the world. Then, withmindfulness, we will know what to do and what not to do to be of help.(1991, p. 91)Buddhism, which had traditionally been more focused on inner transformation,did not have a clear tradition of social activism. Nhất Hạnh collaborated with like-minded peers in Vietnam as he continued to develop both a theory and practice of anonviolent, engaged approach to Buddhism.In the early 1960s, Nhất Hạnh came to the United States for two years, where helectured on Buddhism at Cornell and Columbia Universities (Nhất Hạnh, 1991;1999). As the United States’ involvement in the conflict in Vietnam escalated, hereturned to North America in 1966 to speak out against the war. He took this oppor-tunity to meet with and exchange ideas about nonviolence with important Westernspiritual figures, including Martin Luther King, Jr., Thomas Merton, and DanielBerrigan (King, 2003). As a result of Nhất Hạnh’s advocacy, both North and SouthVietnam considered him a threat and denied him the right to return to Vietnam,beginning a 39 year exile. In 1967, Martin Luther King, Jr. nominated Nhất Hạnhfor the Nobel Peace Prize, saying: “Here is an apostle of peace and non-violence. …His ideas for peace, if applied, would build a monument to ecumenism, to worldbrotherhood, to humanity” (1967). The Nobel Peace Prize, however, was notawarded to anybody that year.From his adopted home base in France, Nhất Hạnh has continued to advocate forpeace and social justice, while being a pioneer introducing many Westerners toBuddhism. In addition to founding six monasteries and dozens of practice centers inAmerica and Europe, Thích Nhất Hạnh has published over 100 books on meditation,mindfulness, and engaged Buddhism. Through these works he has presented his76M. PHILLIPS-ANDERSON, R. PHILLIPS-ANDERSONWriting…ideas on the concepts of interbeing, non-attachment to views, loving speech, deeplistening, and the primacy of love that we will discuss in the next sections.1.1. InterbeingIn order to understand Thích Nhất Hạnh’s approach to nonviolence, it is essen-tial to first explore his belief in the concept of interbeing. In Buddhist doctrine, thisprinciple is traditionally called dependent origination or dependent co-arising. Itrefers to the idea that everything in the universe is interconnected through a complexweb of cause and effect. Thích Nhất Hạnh describes this principle of intercon-nectedness through the exploration of the origins of a piece of paper:If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in thissheet of paper. Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the treescannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essen-tial for the paper to exist. If the cloud is not here, the sheet of paper cannotbe here either. We can say that the cloud and the paper inter-are. “Inter-being” is a word that is not in the dictionary yet, but if we combine the pre-fix “inter-” with the verb “to be,” we have a new verb, “inter-be”...Lookingeven more deeply, we can see we are in it too. This is not difficult to see,because when we look at a sheet of paper, the sheet of paper is part of ourperception. Your mind is in here and mine is also, so we can say that every-thing is in here in this sheet of paper. (1987, p. 53)Another way of saying this is that “we are a part of everything, and everything ispart of us” (Nhất Hạnh, 1991, p. 103). Looking at things from this perspective, itbecomes apparent that Nhất Hạnh believes that we are not really completely sepa-rate from our enemies. He believes that “we belong to each other; we cannot cutreality into pieces. The well-being of ‘this’ is the well-being of ‘that,’ so we have todo things together. Every side is ‘our side’; there is no evil side” (Nhất Hạnh, 1991,p. 103). Polinska (2007) reports that this concept of interbeing is at the center ofNhất Hạnh’s ideas about nonviolence. She observes that Nhất Hạnh’s “Buddhistteachings focus on how our interdependence with others makes partisan conflictunintelligible. Our interbeing with others implies that whether we are so called ’op-pressors’ or ‘the oppressed,’ we all contribute to injustice and violence in the world”(Polinska, 2007, p. 93). So one can see how Nhất Hạnh’s concept of “loving yourenemy” comes from a perspective in which he sees himself as intrinsically con-nected to any person or group of people that could be conceptualized as an “enemy.”Even the very idea of an “enemy” does not fit into this worldview, in whicheveryone is connected to one another.1.2. Non-attachment to viewsAnother essential Buddhist principle that informs Nhất Hạnh’s ideas about non-violence is “non-attachment to views” (2008, p. 8). Nhất Hạnh emphasizes the cen-trality of this tenant to his thinking, not just about social activism, but about theworld itself: “The basic spirit of Buddhism is non-attachment to views.” He evenESSACHESS. Journal for Communication Studies, vol. 10, no. 1(19) / 201777warns against attachment to Buddhist principles themselves: “If you are attached tothese teachings, you are lost” (Nhất Hạnh, 2008, p. 8). Nhất Hạnh is particularlyconcerned about the relationship between inflexible opinions and violence. Hewarns that “War is the outcome of attachment to views, of fanaticism...Peace cannotexist if we maintain our fanaticism concerning our views” (Nhất Hạnh, 2008, p. 8).The commitment to non-attachment to views is so essential to Nhất Hạnh, that thisprinciple informed the first three of The Fourteen Mindfulness Trainings, the foun-dational precepts of the Order of Interbeing that he established in Saigon in 1964(Nhất Hạnh, 1997a). “The Order of Interbeing was born as a spiritual resistancemovement. It is based completely on the teachings of the Buddha. The FirstMindfulness Training—non-attachment to views, freedom from all ideologies—wasa direct answer to the war. Everyone was ready to die and to kill for their beliefs”(Nhất Hạnh, 2008, p. 8).In the Third of the Mindfulness Trainings, the commitment to non-attachment toviews leads to a discussion of love and compassion:We are committed to respecting the right of others to be different, to choosewhat to believe and how to decide. We will, however, learn to help otherslet go of and transform fanaticism and narrowness through loving speechand compassionate dialogue” (Nhất Hạnh, 2007, p. 104).The Eighth and Ninth Mindfulness Trainings bring our attention to deep listeningand truthful and loving speech that further develops his focus on communication ascentral to engaged Buddhism. Nhất Hạnh’s particular approach to nonviolence isencapsulated in The Fourteen Mindfulness Trainings, which advocate approachingall people—including opponents—from a perspective of interconnection, openness,and ultimately love.1.3. What does “love” mean?At this point it is important to clarify what Thích Nhất Hạnh and others are refer-ring to when they talk about love, because this word can trigger numerous associa-tions. Frequently we think of romantic desire or familial affection when we hear theword “love;” for Nhất Hạnh “love” has a different connotation. In his bookTeachings on Love, Nhất Hạnh discusses the Sanskrit word “maitri,” which “can betranslated as ‘love’ or ‘loving kindness’ :Some Buddhist teachers prefer “loving kindness,” as they find the word“love” too dangerous. But I prefer the word “love.” Words sometimes getsick and we have to heal them. We have been using the word “love” tomean appetite or desire, as in “I love hamburgers.” We have to use lan-guage more carefully. “Love” is a beautiful word; we have to restore itsmeaning. The word “maitri” has roots in the word mitra which meansfriend. In Buddhism, the primary meaning of love is friendship. (1997b, p.2)78M. PHILLIPS-ANDERSON, R. PHILLIPS-ANDERSONWriting…The primacy of love as a feature of nonviolence is also found in the words ofMahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. Terchek (2001) observes that “Gandhiwants to weave the threads of love everywhere and extend them to everyone, inclu-ding our enemies” and views “Gandhian love” as founded on an “openness thatenables a person to find a unity and mutuality with others.” Gandhi equated lovewith nonviolence itself: “Nonviolence, in its active form, is goodwill toward all life.It is pure love” (1996, p. 41). For Gandhi then, love is not only an interpersonalemotion, that is, a feeling that exists between two people. Neither is love somethingsoft or sentimental. Key to Gandhi’s concept of nonviolence is his belief in love asperhaps one of the most powerful forces for social change: “Power is of two kinds.One is obtained by the fear of punishment and the other by acts of love. Power basedon love is a thousand times more effective and permanent then the one derived fromfear of punishment” (Gandhi, 1925, p. 15).It was after reading Gandhi that King first came to see “love” as applying tomore than just individuals, but as being a powerful force for change (1956, p. 97).When King appealed to his followers to “love your enemy,” he used the Greek termagape to describe the “love” that he referred to. “Agape means understanding, re-deeming good will for all men,” explained King. He went on to describe it as a “loveseeking to create and preserve community” (King & Washington, 1986, p. 19). ForKing, the principle of nonviolence in intrinsically linked to his ideas of “love”:At the center of nonviolence stands the principle of love. The nonviolentresister would contend that in the struggle for human dignity, the oppressedpeople of the world must not succumb to the temptation of becoming bitteror indulging in hate campaigns. To retaliate in kind would do nothing butintensify the existence of hate in the universe. Along the way of life, so-meone must have sense enough and morality enough to cut off the chain ofhate. This can only be done by projecting the ethic of love to the center ofour lives. (King & Washington, 1986, p. 19)Just as “understanding” is the first word King used to define agape, it is also atthe center of Nhất Hạnh’s idea of love: “Understanding and love are not two things,but just one” (Nhất Hạnh, 1987, p. 14). For Nhất Hạnh, looking deeply into thewants, needs, and suffering of another is essential for achieving both love and peace.Agreeing with King and Gandhi, Nhất Hạnh believes that “Love is the essence ofnonviolence” (1993, p. 39). He goes on to say that that “love” is essential to both theprincipled and pragmatic goals of nonviolence: “Out of love and the willingness toact selflessly, strategies, tactics, and techniques for a nonviolent struggle arise natu-rally” (Nhất Hạnh, 1993, p. 39). Nhất Hạnh’s view is not universally shared. In thenext section we will discuss differing conceptions of nonviolence and review theways that rhetorical and communication studies, and to a more limited extent politi-cal science and peace studies, have treated the subject.ESSACHESS. Journal for Communication Studies, vol. 10, no. 1(19) / 2017792. Concepts of nonviolenceIt is common in the academic literature to define a split between pragmatic andprincipled nonviolence (see Martin & Varney 2003, Schock 2003, and Sharp 1973).Those taking the pragmatic approach view nonviolence primarily through the lens ofaction, including peaceful protest, sit-ins, and boycotts, without the necessity for acorresponding set of beliefs in the fundamental values of nonviolence. According toSchock, “nonviolent action is active—it involves activity in the collective pursuit ofsocial or political objectives—and it is non-violent—it does not involve physicalforce or the threat of physical force against human beings” (2003, p. 705). Thisstrategic approach focuses on nonviolent action as a purely tactical tool, even a wea-pon, which can be used to fight oppressive regimes.Another important perspective on nonviolence is that the motives and beliefs ofthose employing nonviolence are essential elements in its practice. Principled non-violence, exemplified by Gandhi, King, and Nhất Hạnh, “seeks to love potentialenemies rather than destroy them and promotes nonviolent peaceful means to peace-ful ends. Its preferred processes are persuasion, cooperation and nonviolent resis-tance to forceful coercion for political purposes” (Clements, 2015, p. 12). Alternati-vely, Gene Sharp, a leading proponent of pragmatic nonviolence, argues that:the use of the term “nonviolence” is especially unfortunate, because it con-fuses these forms of mass action with beliefs in ethical or religious nonvio-lence (“principled nonviolence”). Those beliefs, which have their merits,are different phenomena that usually are unrelated to mass struggles con-ducted by people who do not share such beliefs. (2005b, p. 9)The principled nonviolence approach finds support from religious figures, but isnot sectarian in its practice. That the three leaders in nonviolent movements comefrom Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist perspectives demonstrates that their perspec-tive transcends exclusionary religious beliefs. Whether pragmatic or principled,nonviolence aims to create change by making visible that the institutional power’sperceived legitimacy is based on force and not on moral authority or public agree-ment. This is principally a communication activity.3.1. Rhetoric and NonviolenceNonviolent rhetoric engages the world and seeks to change it by speaking withand listening to “the other”. Gorsevski finds in a review of rhetorical studies of non-violence that “it remains a marginalized area of research, tending to represent therhetorics of specific interest groups such as women or minorities, rather than casesof rhetoric of general interest to a wider array of students and scholars” (2012, p.10).Given the seeming affinity between rhetoric and nonviolence, it is surprising thatthere has not been more scholarship on the subjects. Gorsevski (2012) offers ananalysis of the intersections between theories of nonviolence and rhetoric. Sheargues “Nonviolent theory shows rhetoricians that language and culture, in a sense80M. PHILLIPS-ANDERSON, R. PHILLIPS-ANDERSONWriting…our way of creating and perpetuating our reality, can be devoid of, or impose mini-mal, aggression” (Gorsevski, 2012, p. xxiv). Nonviolent actions are almost alwayscommunicative and rhetorical. Speaking, listening, writing, occupying a space, mar-ching, and noncooperation are all rhetorical moves. The people employing them doso to communicate an idea to their supporters, their (perceived) opponents, and themedia.Herrick (2013) explains that “rhetorical discourse typically is a response either toa situation or to a previous rhetorical statement” (p. 11). Nhất Hạnh’s concept ofcompassionate communication and deep listening merges clearly with Herrick’sterminology of rhetoric as “response-making” and “response-inviting” (Herrick,2013, p. 11). Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca’s New Rhetoric Project tried to theo-rize a way in which people could argue to gain the adherence of others without re-sorting to force. They wrote that “recourse to argumentation assumes the establish-ment of a community of minds, which while it lasts, excludes the use of violence”(Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1969, p. 55). They did not frame their task explicitlyas nonviolent rhetoric, but there are clear connections.Very few works in communication and rhetorical studies have looked at NhấtHạnh. Ucok-Sayrak (2014) compared the ethics of communication in the works ofLevinas and Nhất Hạnh finding that in both “frameworks, the ethical response to theOther requires a kind of receptivity beyond the boundaries of rational-discursivethinking and the conventional ‘I’” (p. 262). There have not been studies in rhetoricand communication that directly examine Nhất Hạnh’s ideas about nonviolentcommunication. We seek to show how Nhất Hạnh’s engaged Buddhism can be readas a rhetorical theory of nonviolence.Nonviolent methods can take many forms, most of which are clearly communi-cative. Sharp (1973) categorizes them as protest and persuasion, noncooperation,and intervention. Though he explicitly includes persuasion in the first group, actionsin each of three categories are rhetorical. Certainly protest and persuasion, includingspeeches, music, and picketing are designed to communicate and persuade. In thesecond category, noncooperation, actions such as strikes and boycotts serve not onlyto disrupt normal social and economic activities, but to persuade the public that thevalues of the nonviolent movement are worthy of attention and superior to those ofthe opposition. The third category, intervention, includes the actions of sit-ins, hun-ger strikes, and seeking imprisonment. Again, these actions have their principalforce as communication events. The pain and possible death of the protestor has nomaterial effect on institutional power. The force of the action is communicative.Martin and Varney (2003) note that nonviolent action “creates meanings amongobservers, though explanations help to crystallize the purposes of the actions or,semiotically speaking, select out denotations from a range of connotations” (p. 215).These actions garner attention for the movement, demonstrate commitment andcredibility, and engage the audience in a reconsideration of the values of those enga-ged in the movement and institutional power.ESSACHESS. Journal for Communication Studies, vol. 10, no. 1(19) / 201781We often think of persuasion as opponents who try to change the mind of theother. Success is measured by the change of belief. But this rarely happens in prac-tice. How often do we really change our minds about something, particularlysomething we strongly believe? Nhất Hạnh is not the only one to think about alter-natives to narrow theories of persuasion. Two theories that have attempted this areGilbert’s coalescent argumentation and Foss and Griffin’s invitational rhetoric.One approach that seeks to move beyond traditional theories of persuasion isGilbert’s coalescent argumentation. He describes it asa normative ideal that involves the joining together or two disparate claimsthrough recognition and exploration of opposing positions. By uncoveringthe crucial connection between a claim and the attitudes, beliefs, feelings,values, and needs to which it is connected dispute partners are able to iden-tify points of agreement and disagreement. These points can then be uti-lized to effect coalescence, a joining or merging of divergent positions, byforming the basis for a mutual investigation of non-conflictual options thatmight otherwise have remained unconsidered. (Gilbert, 1995, p. 837)Rather than attitude change, argumentation often leads to outcomes that “includea negotiated agreement, a compromise, or a realization that further dispute is futile”(Gilbert, 1995, p. 837). This determination requires listening between dispute part-ners and a willingness to speak what they believe deeply. The ability to both listenand speak in this way is reflected in Nhất Hạnh’s ideas of loving speech and deeplistening. This approach is challenging given how complex beliefs are.The first step of coalescent argumentation is asking the question “why are we ar-guing?” (Gilbert, 1995, p. 841). “If I do not know what you want, what you believe,what you feel, then it is difficult, to say the least, for me to satisfy or shift thoseneeds through argumentation” (Gilbert, 1995, p. 842). Persuasion is often thought ofas taking something (e.g., an arguer takes a point or position away from the other).Gilbert argues that “most analytical tools focus on the desire of the respondent toeliminate, defeat or otherwise invalidate the proponent's reasons. While this can beimportant in certain circumstances, it should not be the major goal of a respondent,and certainly not at the outset of a dispute” (Gilbert, 1995, p. 842). Nhất Hạnh andcoalescent argumentation can be read as viewing argumentation as an opportunity togive things to one another. Those gifts may be a change in attitude, the space toreconsider beliefs, or even just the chance to be heard.Gilbert writes that a claim is like the tip of an iceberg for a much larger, moredeeply held position: “To effect persuasion one must impact on the entire positionand not just the claim…[The position] is a matrix of beliefs, attitudes, emotions,insights, and values connected to a claim” (1995, pp. 839-840). A critical part ofGilbert’s theory is the recognition that arguers do not always have self-awareness ofthe depths of their positions. In the way that a person who is tortured may saysomething they do not believe in order to stop the physical violence, arguers maymake claims that they do not believe or are fearful to question if there is a threat of82M. PHILLIPS-ANDERSON, R. PHILLIPS-ANDERSONWriting…physical or communicative violence. Nhất Hạnh’s approach calls on practitioners toengage their own complicated feelings and to listen to those of others.While most Western rhetorical theorists have thought of rhetoric and persuasionas synonymous, Foss and Griffin (1995), offer an invitational rhetoric that chal-lenges that assumption. It is a rhetoric that is “rooted in equality, immanent value,and self-determination” (p. 5). Nhất Hạnh might say that the invitation stems froman understanding of interbeing. Foss and Griffin highlight other features that wouldbe familiar to Nhất Hạnh including, non-judgement, appreciation, listening, andnonadversarial positioning. Such an approach emphasizes a context in which parti-cipants are not opponents and persuasion is not coercion. In relation to nonviolentrhetoric, Gorsevski (2012) states that “persuasion is not necessarily violent (or evencoercive) when it is performed in the context of true nonviolent action. True nonvio-lent action means action that is aimed at resisting oppression, either purposefully orunwittingly” (p. 186).The idea that participants in argumentation are willing to change is both necessa-ry and challenging. Nhất Hạnh (1995) writes:We have to appreciate that truth can be received from outside of—not onlywithin—our own group. If we do not believe that, entering into dialoguewould be a waste of time. If we think we monopolize the truth and we stillorganize a dialogue, it is not authentic. We have to believe that by engagingin dialogue with the other person, we have the possibility of making achange within ourselves, that we can become deeper. Dialogue is not ameans for assimilation in the sense that one side expands and incorporatesthe other into its “self.” Dialogue must be practiced on the basis of “non-self.” We have to allow what is good, beautiful, and meaningful in theother’s tradition to transform us. (p. 9)If we do not believe that we ourselves are capable of changing our beliefs as aresult of dialogue and persuasion, then why should we believe that others have thisability or desire? If we think that the “other side” is persuadable (not just that theyshould be persuadable) is it only because we think that their belief is a weak one,that they do not really believe their stated position, or that they are willing to let goof their belief in exchange for something of greater value? In order to have a dia-logue in which one’s opponent is open to persuasion, we must also be open to suchpersuasion. The ability to persuade, or be persuaded, requires some realization ofnon-attachment to views.The persuasive function of nonviolence engages several audiences. In a nonvio-lent action, there is the immediate audience, usually institutional powers or theirrepresentatives. A consequence of nonviolent action may be a violent response, andto suffer violence is, itself, a communicative act of nonviolence. In Gandhi’s view“Suffering is infinitely more powerful than the law of the jungle for converting theopponent and opening his ear, which are otherwise shut, to the voice of reason” (ascited in Southern Christian Leadership Conference, p. 2). As a matter of persuasion,ESSACHESS. Journal for Communication Studies, vol. 10, no. 1(19) / 201783it may be very difficult to find immediate attitude change. But the audience that maybe more open to change is that which views the action from afar. This mediatedexperience is the goal of much of nonviolent action. In Gandhi’s protest on the Dha-rasana Salt Works in 1930, the greatest change in beliefs about the movement camefrom those with a mediated experience of the action, particularly an internationalaudience who read about the protests in their newspapers (Martin & Varney, 2003,p. 215).If we transfer Nhất Hạnh’s concepts of interbeing and engaged Buddhism to rhe-toric’s concern with audience, we are left in an interesting place. In traditional Bud-dhism, the self is often seen as the primary rhetorical audience. In Nhất Hạnh’srhetorical nonviolence, the self and the other are simultaneous audiences. In rhetori-cal studies we are used to talking about multiple audiences for discourse. For NhấtHạnh, all beings, in fact all creation, is part of the audience for every speech. Thisincludes the speaker as an audience as well. Perelman and Oblrechts-Tyteca (1969)wrote that it “very often happens that discussion with someone else is simply ameans we use to see things more clearly ourselves” (p. 41). When we move past theidea of self versus enemy, rhetoric addressed outwardly also has a persuasive effectinwardly. To use violent language when speaking to, or about, the perceived enemyis to perpetuate violence against oneself. This does not, however, take away frompersuasion as the main tool of nonviolence.3. Why nothing less than love?Even for many who accept a nonviolent approach to conflict resolution, the ideaof “loving your enemy” can be a difficult concept to embrace. One might think,“Just because I don’t like violence, doesn’t mean I’m ready to love my enemy.”Sharp directly questions the need for a nonviolent ethic that is based in moral idealslike “loving your enemy.” He states that,when understood as a requirement for nonviolent action (rather than ahelpful refinement), the demand for “love” for people who have done cruelthings may turn people who are justifiably bitter and unable to love theiropponents toward violence as the technique most consistent with bitternessand hatred. (Sharp, 2005a, p. 635)In response to Sharp’s casting of “love” as an unnecessary “refinement” of non-violent social movements, critics have explored the limitation of a solely strategic orpragmatic approach to nonviolence to achieve the lasting goals of peace and socialjustice (Bharadwaj, 1998; Clements, 2015; Braatz, 2014). They point to recent ins-tances in which pragmatic nonviolence was effective at bringing about regimechange, but ultimately failed to provide citizens with basic assurances of safety orequality, including the Philippines and Egypt. Braatz (2014) observes that even “asuccessful civilian resistance movement, one that removes an unpopular repressiveregime, is no guarantee of democratic inclusion, social justice, equality of opportuni-84M. PHILLIPS-ANDERSON, R. PHILLIPS-ANDERSONWriting…ty, and human rights protections” (p. 5). Braatz goes on to argue that “if the goal isto reduce violence of all types … [then] the principled approach—identifying andrejecting any and all forms of violence—is also the pragmatic one” (2014, p. 11).The strategic approach to nonviolence is very different from what Nhất Hạnhand others who prioritize the pursuit of peace and understanding among people arti-culate. They are not focused on just short term goals of policy or regime change.Gandhi suggested that without love, you cannot really have nonviolence. He said:We can only win over the opponent by love, never by hate. Hate is the sub-tlest form of violence. We cannot be really non-violent and yet have hate inus …Violent non-co-operation only multiplies evil. … As evil can only besustained by violence, withdrawal of support of evil requires complete abs-tention from violence. (Gandhi, 1971, p. 96)Martin Luther King, Jr. also spoke unequivocally about his commitment to “love ourenemies.” King explains that “We never get rid of an enemy by meeting hate withhate; we get rid of an enemy by getting rid of enmity. By its very nature, hate des-troys and tears down; by its very nature, love creates and builds up” (2012, p. 50-51). Both King and Gandhi are looking beyond just removing current sources ofoppression, to how to build communities that make it hard for oppression to takehold.In highlighting the diverse spiritual origins of the concept of “loving your ene-my,” Thích Nhất Hạnh (1995) acknowledges its apparent contradiction: “WhenGandhi said that love is the force that can liberate, he meant we have to love ourenemy. Even if our enemy is cruel, even if he is crushing us, sowing terror and in-justice, we have to love him. This is the message of Jesus” (p. 84). He says thatgaining knowledge and understanding is the key to this challenge: “Understanding aperson brings us the power to love and accept him. And the moment we love andaccept him, he ceases to be our enemy. To ‘love our enemy’ is impossible, becausethe moment we love him, he is no longer our enemy” (Nhất Hạnh, 1995, p. 85). ForNhất Hạnh, communication and love are necessary partners in nonviolent practice.This is a different approach from many rhetorical and nonviolence theorists, butthere are bridges when we consider the rhetorical value of understanding one’s au-dience.4. How can you start to love your enemy?Nhất Hạnh also recognizes that it is not obvious to most of us how to cultivate apeaceful presence: “Everyone knows that peace has to begin with oneself, but notmany people know how to do it” (as cited in Malkin, 2003). He often uses the imageof seeds in ground to illustrate the tendencies that are in each of us. He says that wehave both the seeds of love, compassion, and understanding; as well as the seeds offear, anger and intolerance. According to Nhất Hạnh (2003), “when we know howESSACHESS. Journal for Communication Studies, vol. 10, no. 1(19) / 201785to cultivate the seeds of love, compassion, and understanding in us every day, thoseseeds become stronger and the seeds of violence and hatred will become weaker andweaker” (p. 2).In his books and lectures, Nhất Hạnh outlines practical steps—includingbreathing and meditation—that people can take to help transform the seeds of vio-lence. Even as he encourages the cultivation of internal peace, Nhất Hạnh (2003)urges people to actively practice cultivating love and understanding in our interac-tions with others: “There are concrete ways to train ourselves to communicate non-violently so that compassion for one another is awakened and mutual understandingbecomes possible again. Speaking and listening with compassion are the essentialpractices of nonviolent communication” (p. 21). His idea of engaged mindfulnessinvolves engaging in practices that build peace both inside oneself and in the world.One such practice is writing love letters, both to loved ones and to political lea-ders. Nhất Hạnh (1991) refers to letter writing as not just a powerful act of lovingspeech, but also “a practice of looking deeply” (p. 110). Nhất Hạnh was concernedby his observation of anger and aggression in the American peace movement notingthat “People in the peace movement can write very good protest letters, but they arenot so skilled at writing love letters” (1991, p. 110). Nhất Hạnh hopes that theycould use practices, like writing love letters, to give them a “fresh way of beingpeace” (1991, p. 110). The letter writing that he encourages is an embodiment of hisrhetorical nonviolent approach.5. Thích Nhất Hạnh’s Love Letter to President BushAs a Buddhist and peace activist, Nhất Hạnh opposes all armed conflict. Duringthe early 2000s, he advocated for the United States to withdraw from the conflict inIraq. In 2006, he wrote a letter to President George W. Bush about his feelings aboutthe war.1 There are several features of the letter that should be examined. First, the1 This is the letter Nhất Hạnh wrote to George W. Bush. He sent a handwritten letter to the White Houseand released a copy to the public.Dear Mr. President,Last night, I saw my brother (who died two weeks ago in the USA) coming back to me in a dream. Hewas with all his children. He told me, “Let’s go home together.” After a millisecond of hesitation, I toldhim joyfully, “Ok, let’s go.”Waking up from that dream at 5 am this morning, I thought of the situation in the Middle East; and for thefirst time, I was able to cry. I cried for a long time, and I felt much better after about one hour. Then Iwent to the kitchen and made some tea. While making tea, I realized that what my brother had said istrue: our home is large enough for all of us. Let us go home as brothers and sisters.Mr. President, I think that if you could allow yourself to cry like I did this morning, you will also feelmuch better. It is our brothers that we kill over there. They are our brothers, God tells us so, and we alsoknow it. They may not see us as brothers because of their anger, their misunderstanding, and their discri-mination. But with some awakening, we can see things in a different way, and this will allow us to res-pond differently to the situation. I trust God in you; I trust Buddha nature in you.Thank you for reading.In gratitude and with brotherhood,86M. PHILLIPS-ANDERSON, R. PHILLIPS-ANDERSONWriting…form of the letter is important. Nhất Hạnh wrote it by hand. The format of the com-munication may contribute to its reception. We write and receive fewer pieces ofhandwritten mail today. Noam (2005) remarks that the flood of electronic messagesmay reduce their persuasiveness and that in that environment “the most effectivemeans of communications to an elected official—other than a campaign contributioncheck—becomes the handwritten letter”. We do not know if President Bush receivedthe letter or was persuaded by it because he did not offer any response. But Bushwas not the only audience for the letter. Nhất Hạnh released the letter publically andposted it on his website. This allows anyone who can access it the opportunity to bepersuaded by Nhất Hạnh’s words.Nhất Hạnh begins this letter with an intensely personal memory. In this introduc-tion, he is clearly trying to approach Bush as another human, not as a leader or poli-cy maker. Nhất Hạnh (1991) has written of the importance of attempting to engageone’s intended audience. He encourages activists to write letters to leaders “that theywill want to read, and not just throw away” (p. 110). To this end, he writes that “thekind of language we use should not turn people off. The President is a person likeany of us” (Nhất Hạnh, 1991, p. 110). In recounting his dream of his recently decea-sed brother, Nhất Hạnh is acknowledging the very human nature of both himself andGeorge W. Bush.Also in this anecdote, Nhất Hạnh is recounting a moment of joy. This may be anunexpected emotion in the context of both Nhất Hạnh’s personal loss and the con-flict in the Middle East that he addresses. This reference to his own joyfulnessmakes sense in the context of his belief that “To suffer is not enough” (Nhất Hạnh,1987, p. 3). In pursuing an end to war, injustice, and even personal suffering, NhấtHạnh emphasizes the importance of stopping in order “to be in touch with the won-ders of life” (1987, p. 3). He believes that cultivating the “seeds” of peace and joywithin oneself is important to being able to bring peace and joy to the world.When Nhất Hạnh mentions that he “was able to cry,” he is modeling his ownability to acknowledge and take care of his own feelings. He warns that “when wehold back our feelings and ignore our pain, we are committing violence againstourselves,” (Nhất Hạnh, 2003, p. 16). The importance of being aware of, and nurtu-ring, our own suffering is frequently reiterated by Nhất Hạnh as an essential steptowards peace. He writes, “The practice of nonviolence is to be here, to be present,and to recognize our own pain or despair” (Nhất Hạnh, 2003, p. 16). He suggeststhat to “recognize, embrace, and transform” difficult feelings can help us from har-ming ourselves or others (2003, p. 17). Gilbert’s idea of a claim being the tip of aniceberg resonates here. Nhất Hạnh is sharing with Bush his matrix of beliefs andvalues that support his opposition to war. That sharing may lead to more effectivepersuasion that engages the communicative partner.Thích Nhất Hạnh Plum Village (Nhất Hạnh, 2006)An image of letter is available at http://plumvillage.org/letters-from-thay/letter-to-president-g-w-bush-august-8-2006/.ESSACHESS. Journal for Communication Studies, vol. 10, no. 1(19) / 201787When Nhất Hạnh (2003) states that “our home is large enough for all of us,” andextends an invitation to “go home as brothers and sisters,” (p. 62) he is referring tothe concept of interbeing discussed earlier. Nhất Hạnh believes that once individualsrealize their “interconnectedness with others,” they will begin to see how their ac-tions affect themselves and “all other life” (2003, p. 62). In the letter’s followingparagraph, Nhất Hạnh, continues in this vein by saying that “It is our brothers andsisters that we kill over there” (2003, p. 62). While he draws attention to death anddestruction caused by the war, Nhất Hạnh avoids blaming Bush alone, by using thewords “we kill.” By communicating in this way, Nhất Hạnh illustrates that, in ac-cord with his belief in interbeing, that he also considers himself part of the cause ofthis suffering.Nhất Hạnh, conscious of the background and beliefs of his direct audience, ap-peals to Bush as a Christian when he writes that “God tell us so.” In the forward toLiving Buddha, Living Christ, David Steindl-Rast (1995), a Catholic Benedictinemonk, writes that “From the biblical perspective there is no human being who is notalive with God’s own breath” (p. xiv). In his writing and talking about the intersec-tion of Buddhist and Christian beliefs, Nhất Hạnh offers this relationship of God toall beings as a way for Christians generally, and Bush specifically, to understandinterbeing. He also, however, acknowledges the challenge of seeing people as “bro-thers” when you are in conflict with them. In writing about “their anger, their mi-sunderstanding, and their discrimination,” Nhất Hạnh is addressing the issue ofunderstanding. He is modeling for Bush the practice of looking deeply, trying tounderstand the suffering that leads to violence.Nhất Hạnh concludes his letter on a hopeful note. He clearly believes that trans-formation is possible, and that seeing “things in a different way” can lead to respon-ding “differently to the situation.” While Nhất Hạnh is deeply opposed to Bush’sactions in Iraq and the Middle East, this practice gave him an opportunity to practi-cing his own deep looking and loving speech. In this letter, Nhất Hạnh is both lo-ving his “enemy” and modeling for Bush how one can “love your enemy.”ConclusionNonviolence, when viewed simply as a strategy to stop or avoid an immediateconflict, can be successful for a time. Thích Nhất Hạnh shows us that nonviolentrhetoric and nonviolent living as a continuing practice are necessary if we are tocreate a world of peace. To this end, we have outlined what a rhetorical theory ofnonviolence looks like from the writings of Nhất Hạnh. His approach asks the non-violent speaker to be concerned with audience, argument, and style. In the sense ofinterbeing, audiences are composed of the speaker, all who encounter their discourseand in a fundamental way, the whole universe; to harm one is to harm all. Whenmaking arguments, we should examine why we hold the positions we do and articu-late them truthfully, but be open to change. Non-attachment to views is central toboth engaged Buddhism and persuasion. In terms of style, we must be mindful that88M. PHILLIPS-ANDERSON, R. PHILLIPS-ANDERSONWriting…language can be violent. Speakers should not just avoid making threats, but ap-proach themselves and their perceived enemy with love. Nhất Hạnh does not offerthis as a prescriptive rhetorical theory. Rather these are ideas designed to guidepeople to speak and listen in way that increases love, decreases violence, and createsthe possibility for true peace.If those of us who study rhetoric and communication believe that we can changethe world through language and that those efforts are preferable to violence, weshould devote more of our scholarly attention to nonviolence. Using violent rhetoricand hating our perceived enemies while advocating for peace is still participating inthe culture of war. In many places, nonviolence is the only form of protest acceptedby most citizens and political institutions. Its effectiveness can be enhanced throughengagement with Nhất Hạnh’s approach of nonviolent communication. The successor failure of nonviolence is not measured in one conflict, one movement, or onetime. We return to the ideas of the leaders of principled nonviolence because theyhave applicability in all contexts, not simply in response to one instance of violenceor oppression. It is an ongoing practice that has the potential to save the world.Note: The authors would like to thank Mitchell Ratner and Paul Crystal for theirgracious help.References<ref>Bharadwaj, L K.
