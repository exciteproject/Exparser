Focusing onthe Europeanization of public discourse in Italy as a casestudy, this article addresses the speciﬁc problem of theformation of supranational public spheres. On the basis ofcontent analyses of daily press and interviews, we argue thatvarious forms of Europeanization of the public discourse areindeed on the rise, with a growing presence not only ofpurely European actors but also of European targets andframes. Europeanization appears to have been traditionallya ‘top-down’ process: in fact the more Europeanized is apolicy, actor, target or issue scope, the less civil societyactors seem to have access to the public sphere. However,some changes across time emerge, with the developmentof (conﬂictual) forms of ‘Europeanization from below’.7 77 8European Union Politics 7(1)The Europeanization of public discourse: An introductionThe growing competences of the European Union (EU) challenge parties,interest groups, and social movement organizations that have mainlydeveloped at the national level. The European integration processes createdhopes and fears concerning the distribution of resources and power betweencollective actors (Bartolini, 2002). Many studies have addressed the capacityof the traditional actors of representative democracies to adapt to, or even totake advantage of, European integration, focusing especially on their abilityto organize and act at the European level (for the most recent contributionssee Gabel and Hix, 2004; Steenbergen and Scott, 2004; Thomassen et al., 2004;Wessels, 2004).In this article, we want to address the issue of the impact of Europeaniza-tion on national actors by focusing on their public discourse on Europeanissues. We consider the public discourse on Europe as a relevant issue innormative as well as empirical terms. The accountability problem of inter-national governmental organizations (IGOs) has usually been analysed interms of a lack (or a weakness, in the case of the EU) of those traditionalmechanisms of control developed in representative democracies: the ‘demo-cratic deﬁcit’ has indeed been mainly discussed in terms of the absence (orlimited competences) of elected bodies. Democracies, however, require notonly electoral bodies but also open arenas where public decisions are subjectto the ‘proof of discussion’ (Manin, 1995). In democratic deliberation, issuesreferring to the public good are debated in public spheres of different types,including the mass media (Habermas, 1981, 1991): free and equal individualshold governors accountable by engaging in discussions based on reason andthe public good.A central problem connected to the shift of power to supranationalinstitutions is the difﬁculty of subjecting their decisions to the ‘proof ofdiscussion’. Some analyses have in fact linked the weak legitimacy ofEuropean institutions to the weakness of the European public sphere as aprecondition for deliberative legitimization as well as representative account-ability. The Europeanization of the public sphere has usually been considereda delicate issue, in terms of both the ﬂimsiness of the process (Gerhards, 1993)and the lack of research on the topic (Le Torrec et al., 2001). Exploring thisissue further, a number of characteristics of EU politics have been held respon-sible for the absence of a truly European public sphere: the democratic deﬁcitlinked to the limited powers of the European Parliament; the secretiveworking methods of the European Commission; and the intergovernmentalnature of the European Council. Characteristics of the EU’s media systemhave also been mentioned when explaining the low level of EuropeanizationDella Porta and Caiani The Europeanization of Public Discourse in Italy7 9in political communication, for instance the tendency of journalists to usetraditional categories rather than describing the novel aspects of the Europeanenterprise; the lack of a common language and a uniﬁed public; the preva-lence of national agendas even in relation to purely EU news; and the preva-lence of intergovernmental and elite-driven images of the EU (the EuropeanCommission, for example, appearing far more frequently than the Parliament)(Gerhards, 1993; Le Torrec et al., 2001).The (largely pessimistic) body of research on the European public spheremainly compares the latter with the forms and institutions of national publicspheres, and assesses the difﬁculties encountered in the emerging Europeanmass media, political parties, etc. In our work, we do not exclude the possi-bility of the formation of genuine, supranational European public spheres,yet we do speculate about the presence of different paths towards the Euro-peanization of a speciﬁc element related to the debate on the public sphere –public discourse, deﬁned as ‘the “texts” emanating from the interaction ofpeople in public debate’ (Van de Steeg, 2002: 502), focusing our attention onmedia texts.We use the concept of Europeanization to refer not only to ‘the emer-gence and development at the European level of distinct structures of govern-ance’ (Risse et al., 2001: 3) but also to the impacts of these structures at thedomestic level in inﬂuencing the ways in which collective actors make theirdemands visible in public discourses. In this sense, we address the ‘pro-cessual’ aspects of Europeanization (Fabbrini, 2003) by analysing the recipro-cal inﬂuences activated between the European and national structures – whatRadaelli and Franchino have recently deﬁned as ‘bottom-up Europeanisation’– to indicate a research design that is pitched at the level of domestic politicsand policy (national or local): it starts from ‘an analysis of the system of inter-action (actors, resources, problems, style, and collective problem-solvingrules) at the domestic level’, and raises the question of ‘whether the EU affectsthis system of interaction and if so in what way (as a resource, as a reformu-lation of the problem, as a new set of collective problem-solving rules, as aconstraint on what is feasible, as an alteration to the opportunity structure,as a new frame of reference, etc.)’ (Radaelli and Franchino, 2004: 948). We alsofocus on domestic actors, looking at the ways in which European institutionsand European issues are discussed in public discourse.In particular, an analysis of public discourse allows us to address ‘softpressures’ on European integration, expressed through the alteration of thebeliefs and expectations of national actors (Knill and Lehmkuhl, 1999). Theway in which Europe is framed by different actors, together with the role ofdiscourses and ideas, public debates, and political communication on Europe,is in fact gaining attention in social science research on Europeanization. If8 0European Union Politics 7(1)traditional theories that see European integration as driven by nationaleconomic interests provided little space for the role of national debates onEuropean issues, the emergence of constructivist theories in internationalrelations, as well as institutional analyses of Europeanization, has led toincreasing attention being paid to the ways in which national actors perceiveand deﬁne the process of Europeanization. Since the mid-1990s, there hasbeen a social constructivist turn in research on Europeanization, a turndeveloped in order to study the impact of ideas and other socially constructedelements on several policy areas (Quaglia, 2004: 1097). In particular, Euro-peanization proceeds through the work of norms entrepreneurs that adoptand adapt European frames (see, for instance, Börzel and Risse, 2000), andEuropeanization has an impact on the political discourses and ideas throughwhich national actors deﬁne and justify their choices: ‘Not only can Europeaffect formal structures, it can also inﬂuence the values, norms and discourseprevalent in member states. In turn, cognitive transformation may change thepreferences of policy-makers and therefore feedback into the process ofEuropean integration’ (Radaelli, 2000: 2; see also Schmidt and Radaelli, 2004:184). We will indeed analyse how Europe is framed in the public discourse.In this sense, Europeanization is measured not only by the active presenceof European actors but also by domestic actors’ references to European insti-tutions and issues. If Europeanization produces multi-level governance, thencollective actions should adapt to intervening in and inﬂuencing the multipleterritorial layers of governance. As we shall see, domestic collective actors doin fact seem to have adapted their action strategies so as not only to commu-nicate with the various territorial levels of government but also to developstrategies of ‘crossed inﬂuence’. That is, they attempt to apply pressure at thenational level in order to change decisions at the European level, or converselyto apply pressure at the European level in order to change national decisions.A typology of the different forms of Europeanization of the public discoursecan be built by combining the territorial scope of the claimant with that ofthe target. In a fully supranational polity, all important claims would be madeby European political parties, interest groups, social movements and othercollective actors targeting the European institutions, or, as Imig and Tarrow(2001b: 16) put it, ‘with functional interests mobilised through Europeanlobbies, territorial representatives organised in the EU Parliament, and stateinterests represented in the European Council’. National public discoursesmay, however, themselves Europeanize. This may, for instance, occur whenEuropean actors exercise transnational pressure by intervening in nationalpublic discourses, criticizing national policies or propagating Europeanintegration. A third path to the Europeanization of the public discourse isdomestication, where debate over EU decisions takes place at the national levelDella Porta and Caiani The Europeanization of Public Discourse in Italy8 1(Imig and Tarrow, 2001a). Domesticated claims are examples of claims-making in which the EU or its policies are either the source or the indirecttarget of claims by domestic actors, but where the direct target remains thenation-state. In their analysis of protest in Europe, Imig and Tarrow (2001a)stressed that most of the EU-related events that they singled out (406 out of490) were cases of domestication, with an increase in all protest events fromabout 5% in 1992 to 10% in 1997. Such mobilizations may be considered asproof of the dominant position of the nation-state. However, a more carefullook shows the emergence, in the course of these campaigns, of innovationsboth in the organizational structure and in the frames of the protests (dellaPorta 2003a, 2003b). Finally, a form of externalization is present if and whenthe mobilizations and communications of national actors target the EUdirectly: this often takes place in an attempt to put pressure on the groups’own governments (Chabanet, 2002).Where the degree of Europeanization of public discourse proves to bemore relevant than expected, an important question is: who in the discursivearena gains from this shift in the territorial level of debate? Amongst thosewho stress the relevance of the process of European integration for nationalcollective action, positions diverge on its effects in terms of the empowermentof different actors and coalitions. Some scholars expect that civil societyactors, owing amongst other qualities to the ﬂexibility of their organizationalstructures, will be able to adapt quickly to these changes (the increasinglymentioned concept of ‘global civil society’ testifying to this expectation).Others, however, are sceptical – not only that actors endowed with scarcematerial resources will be able to invest in transnational organization-building and the staging of supranational protest events, but also that theycan inﬂuence European politics ‘from below’ (della Porta and Tarrow, 2004).European integration has had the predictable effect of multiplying bothrestrictions and opportunities for various actors. Indeed, the construction ofcommunity institutions, as well as the policies developed by the EU, isincreasingly the object of lively criticisms by loose networks of local, nationaland transnational actors. As Hooghe and Marks (1995), among others, havepredicted, European integration no longer takes place under technocraticcover; there is, instead, an explicit and continuous political conﬂict betweencoalitions of governments, supranational bodies and national interests.In particular, this article investigates the degree and forms of partici-pation of various actors (institutional and non-institutional) in the Euro-peanization of public discourse – that is, their capacity to take part in thedebates and mobilizations referring to European issues, targets and actors.We will also focus on the evaluation of the process of European integrationby institutional actors, political parties, interest groups and social movement8 2European Union Politics 7(1)organizations, demonstrating that (different types of) actors are not merelyadapting to the transforming political context but also bearing speciﬁc visionsof ‘what’ Europe is and should be. In fact, qualitative information from inter-views with representatives of several collective actors in Italy will indicatethat support (or criticism) of European integration can be presented withinextremely varied conceptions of Europe, which emerges in fact as an‘imagined community’ that means very different things to different collectiveactors (della Porta and Caiani, 2005).In what follows we shall describe the signiﬁcant and growing degree ofEuropeanization apparent in Italian public discourse (see also Trenz and Eder2004), albeit with a low presence of civil society actors. Our data indicate that,the more Europeanized a policy, actor, target or issue, the less civil societyactors seem to have access to public discourse (at least in the mainstreammedia). However, we observe some changes across time that display a slowlyemerging Europeanization from below. We shall, moreover, discuss the moreconﬂictual attitudes of some civil society actors toward Europeanization.The Europeanization of public discourse: A research projectThe ﬁrst aim of this article is to assess and compare the degree and forms ofthe Europeanization of public discourse. Thus, we investigate the extent towhich collective actors operating within (national) Italian public discourse arecarriers of Europeanization, by either organizing at the European level,making demands on European institutions, or framing their demands withinEuropean frameworks. Mainly using printed media as a data source, weanalyse the general features of political claims-making by various types ofactors, contrasting institutional and non-institutional actors – the latter oftenbeing indicated by the (widely understood) category of ‘civil society actors’.Focusing on the part of the public discourse represented in the printedmedia does not imply that this is considered to be the only arena in whichclaims are presented. In particular, some actors are less dependent upon themass media because they enjoy direct access to decision-makers; others areless able to inﬂuence the mass media and therefore need to resort to alterna-tive communication channels. Some may choose to address public opinionbecause their claims resonate with the majority public opinion; others mayopt for less visible channels because they have more support among the elitethan in the wider population. However, we assume that the printed mediaare one of the most important arenas of public claims-making, and that mostactors will, at one stage or another, use them in order to make their viewspublic.Della Porta and Caiani The Europeanization of Public Discourse in Italy8 3We shall analyse the presence of different types of Europeanization inItaly, in a cross-time (1990, 1995, 2000, 2002) and cross-issue perspective (inparticular, besides the issue of European integration itself, we focus on sixsubstantive policy ﬁelds, chosen strategically in that they present varyingdegrees of EU policy-making power). Our main assumption is indeed thatthe degree and forms of Europeanization of the public discourse of differentactors will be inﬂuenced primarily by the political opportunities available forthem – i.e. by the set of opportunities and constraints that are offered by theinstitutional structure and political culture of the political system in whichthey operate (see e.g. Tarrow, 1994). In a system of multi-level governance,we hypothesize a higher proportion of references to the European politicalinstitutions and discourses in those policy ﬁelds, such as agriculture andmonetary policies, that fall under the ﬁrst pillar, where EU competences arestrongest; an intermediate level of Europeanization in policy areas such asmigration and defence, which, although based on national decision-making,are discussed in intergovernmental forums (such as the Council of Ministers);and the least Europeanization on education and pension policies, which areaffected by EU institutions through the less intrusive instrument of the OpenMethod of Coordination. Likewise, we hypothesize a growth of references tothe European political institutions and discourses over time as the Europeanintegration process has deepened over the past 15 years.Nevertheless, since the capacity to refer to the EU level is also related tothe characteristics of actors, including their material and symbolic resources,we also expect important differences among collective actors within policyareas. The process of European integration being mainly carried out bygovernment representatives and strengthening executive power at thenational level (Moravcsik, 1994), we also hypothesize a larger presence ofinstitutional actors in Europeanized debate. However, as the neo-functionalapproach to European integration has suggested, growing European com-petences tend to spill over into growing contention on European issues. Wetherefore also hypothesize that strategically oriented actors will increasinglyaddress territorial levels with growing competences. Taking into accountsymbolic resources as well, we expect that targeting the EU level will help tospread supranational frames and identities, legitimizing European insti-tutions even by contesting them.Although the larger project of which this article is part includes sevenEuropean countries, here we will draw only on data for the Italian case,although we often compare these with the general trends in claims-makingthat has emerged in the other European countries in order to underline simi-larities and differences (based upon data available on the Europub.comwebsite).1 In general, Italy has been considered to be a particularly Europhile8 4European Union Politics 7(1)country, with citizens (as in other southern European countries) holding lowopinions of their national elites and being more conﬁdent instead in the func-tioning of European institutions (Sánchez-Cuenca, 2000). Faced with corrup-tion and inefﬁcient public administration, public opinion as well as politicalelites support European integration, which is perceived as an opportunity to‘normalize’ the many Italian pathologies (Giuliani, 2000; Ferrera, 2003: 243).In opinion polls, Italian scores on net support for membership in the EuropeanUnion were in line with the European average of 49% in 2000; this was wellbelow not only Luxembourg (75%) and Ireland (71%), but also the Nether-lands (64%), Belgium and other southern European countries (all above 50%);however, it was above West Germany (36%), Denmark (29%), the UK (5%)and Sweden (1%) (Diez Medrano, 2003: 10). Generous allocations of cohesionfunds may have increased the traditional support for Europe that made Italyone of the founding fathers of the ﬁrst European institutions. A southernEuropean (less developed) welfare state has been cited as explaining highindividual support for European integration (Sánchez-Cuenca, 2000; Brinegarand Jolly, 2005).Bipartisan consensus on Europe was, however, challenged when thecorruption scandals of the early 1990s ended in the disappearance of theChristian Democratic party and the emergence of the centre-right parties LegaNord and Forza Italia, both of which are much less supportive of theEuropean project. Qualitative research on the ‘framing of Europe’ yieldsfrequent references to the beneﬁts of common membership in terms of well-being and economic growth, as well as a belief in the advantages of joiningforces with several small states, but also fears that the EU is opaque, distant,unaccountable and inefﬁcient (Diez Medrano, 2003: Ch. 2). The enlargementof the European Union on its eastern borders, as well as the introduction ofthe euro and the austerity policy imposed in order to meet the Maastrichtcriteria for entering the European Monetary Union, have however contributedto breaking the permissive consensus around European integration. Most ofthe trends that we shall mention in this article are shared across nations, andthe Italian case can be taken as an illustration of more general dynamics.For the empirical data collection we use the methodology of politicalclaim analysis (see Koopmans and Statham, 1999, 2002), a quantitativemethod that takes individual political claims as units of analysis and usesnewspapers as a source for the publicly visible part of this claims-making. Aclaim is deﬁned as an instance of strategic action in the mass media. It consistsof the expression of a political opinion by physical or verbal action, regard-less of the form this expression takes (statement, institutional decision, courtruling, protest, etc.), and regardless of the nature of the actor (media, govern-ments, civil society actors, etc.). The claim analysis approach aims to integrateDella Porta and Caiani The Europeanization of Public Discourse in Italy8 5two methodological traditions of social movement research: (quantitative)protest event analysis (Tarrow, 1989; Franzosi, 1994) and (qualitative) frameanalysis (Snow et al., 1986; Gamson and Modigliani, 1989). By systematicallycoding discursive dimensions, claim analysis broadens the scope of attentionfrom protest to all forms of claims-making in the public domain, includingconventional and verbal actions. Moreover, it locates social movementorganizations within a larger multi-organizational ﬁeld by including insti-tutional and non-institutional actors. The main actors of claim analysis are nolonger ‘protesters’ but claimants, namely the subjects of a strategic action(whether verbal or not) in the mass-mediated public discourse. Although theuse of the daily press as a source of information on protest or public discoursehas been criticized on the basis of the selection biases introduced by the rulesof journalistic coverage, in our research this risk is limited since we are inter-ested speciﬁcally in public claims-making. Further, in order to reduce thedescription bias (McCarthy et al., 1996), besides focusing on quality news-papers (which have to protect their reputation), we based our coding only onthe factual coverage of events.An act of claims-making can normally be broken down into the elementsshown in Figure 1: subject actor, form, addressee, issue, object actor and frame(Koopmans and Erbe, 2002). In order to analyse degrees of Europeanization,we coded the polity/territorial scope at which each actor, addressee, objectand frame are organized – distinguishing between local, regional, national,transnational (multilateral/bilateral), European and supranational (e.g. UN)actors.Although our data set shows the claims-making of detailed categories ofactors (e.g. Italian unions, the Italian green party, etc.), our analysis in thisarticle will focus on the characteristics of the claims-making of generalcategories of actors. Simplifying somewhat, we shall compare institutionalactors (government/executive, judiciary, police and internal securityagencies, military, central banks and other state executive agencies) with non-institutional actors (which we shall refer to under the broad category of civilsociety), including media and journalists, economic interest groupsWho?(Subjectactor)How?(Form)At whom?(Addresseeor target)What?(Issue)For/againstwhom?(Object actor)Why?(Frame)Pro-immigrantsassociationsengage in criticizing the for the some asyluma strike Italian treatment of seekersgovernmentarguing that respect forhuman rights is a corevalue of the EuropeanUnionFigure 1 Example of the ‘typical’ structure of a claim.8 6European Union Politics 7(1)(composed of employers’ organizations and ﬁrms, farmers and agriculturalorganizations, economists and ﬁnancial experts and other professionalorganizations and groups) and social movement organizations (composed ofunions and students’, peace, women’s, immigrants’, environmental,consumer, welfare organizations, etc.). Unions have been included in thecategory of social movements because ﬁrst analyses showed that on severaldimensions they had the same trends and characteristics as other socialmovement organizations. Farmers and agricultural organizations, however,display patterns similar to those of other economic interest groups. Whenmembers of political parties spoke as representatives of public bodies (parlia-ments, governments, etc.), we counted them as institutional actors; when theydid not play this role, we included them in a subcategory of non-institutionalactors, thereby respecting the formal characteristics of parties as voluntaryassociations (even if close to the state). Owing to the small number of claimsmade by members of parties that do not speak as representatives of publicinstitutions, this choice does not affect the result of our analysis; moreover,in the article we will often analyse trends for speciﬁc categories of actors, thusindicating if speciﬁc trends for parties will emerge.Our data were gathered from the news coverage of two quality nationalnewspapers that differ in political afﬁliation: La Repubblica (left oriented) andIl Corriere della Sera (centre oriented). We coded the years 1990, 1995, 2000 and2002. Articles relating to our six policy domains plus the topic of Europeanintegration were collected from two issues per week for 2000 and 2002, andfrom one issue per week for 1990 and 1995. For 2000, we also included tworegional newspapers (La Nazione and Il Mattino), of which one issue was codedper week. The greater part of the database (90%) is constituted by articles fromthe two quality dailies. Culture and sports sections, letters to the editor andsupplements were excluded from the coding; articles in the regional and localsections (where present) were included only if referred to in the inter-national/national news section of the paper. Data were coded on the basis ofa standardized codebook (Koopmans, 2002). All articles in the news sectionand in the economic and business section of the newspapers were checked forrelevant acts. Inter-coder reliability tests were undertaken on both the selec-tion of articles and the coding and, in addition, coders participated in regularonline discussions about difﬁcult cases.2 In Italy, for 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2002,1331 articles were coded for a total of 3541 claims. Among these, 957 claimswere selected for a reduced sample that included only articles with a Europeandimension in either the claimant, the addressee, the issue or the object. Theremaining 2584 claims were selected from a full sample (all articles).3In the last section of the article, we refer to yet another part of theresearch in which, between July 2003 and April 2004, we conducted aroundDella Porta and Caiani The Europeanization of Public Discourse in Italy8 760 semi-structured interviews with representatives of the Italian organizationsthat emerged as most important from the claim analysis in the ﬁelds ofEuropean integration, agriculture and immigration. Interview partners wereselected according to two criteria. First, we referred to the results of the politi-cal claim analysis (the frequency of appearance) concerning these three issueﬁelds. Then we integrated the lists of the most inﬂuential actors in the debatewith our knowledge of the core actors active in the policy domain understudy; we also consulted academic experts in each ﬁeld for additional sugges-tions. The semi-structured questionnaire focused on changes in the communi-cation and mobilization strategies of collective actors related to the processof European integration. Concerning the interview sample, in each of the threepolicy ﬁelds, ﬁve interview partners were identiﬁed from four categories ofcollective actor (government/administration, political parties, economicinterest groups and social movement groups), to make a total of 20 inter-viewees in each policy ﬁeld. Further details on the sampling of our interviewpartners and the questionnaire used are available on the project website (fora qualitative and detailed analysis of the interviews, see della Porta, 2004;della Porta and Caiani, 2004, 2005).The dominant Europeanization: From aboveAn important criterion for the analysis of the public debates and actionsconcerning Europe is the extent to which different types of collective actorparticipate in them. Which actors are the carriers of the Europeanization ofpublic discourse? Are they institutional actors, pushing Europeanization fromabove, or civil society actors, bringing about a Europeanization from below?Both the realist and functionalist standpoints perceive European developmentas an elite-driven, top-down process. Institutional actors, at all territoriallevels, have been seen as the driving force behind policy-making (see Imigand Tarrow, 2001a). Important studies in the ﬁeld emphasize institution-building as a formal process involving formal actors. However, much researchon the formation of nation-states reveals that, over and above constitutionalinput ‘from above’, the construction of these territorial entities involved thedevelopment of a common identity through participation ‘from below’.Moreover, the development of a ‘European citizenship’ is a topic of increas-ing interest to both scholars and policy-makers.By looking at the Europeanization of public discourse by policy domain,we can test the hypothesis that discursive references to the EU increase withEU competences. The hypothesis that Europeanization is facilitated by theavailability of organizational resources is instead tested by comparing88 European Union Politics 7(1)ee ptyp tryc ia twsea rav ebe e Vsid th ’rsw ruo t Ce ;q b ), 1s V 0ied re .0te ; bin n iao raren ;see )andruc em rs:s h toie c cc s ailpo ion teaNo6 9 9 8 8 4 0 4 l; tro tc1 7 3 9 8 8 8 8 c a5 3 3 2 5 3 5 o a n2 tr e en lo b ela .0 .0 .0 .0 .0 .0 .0 .0t 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 , n eo 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 sa ee amT 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 tiia s md ub ra (Pe .3 .9 .3 .7 .7 .5 .6 :s .C *M 4 – 0 6 1 2 5 3 e n **r o 9tuu itra .02lstn ic eg =e rg t dn ll m a i ea e ; n ﬁico vo .6 .0 .8 .3 .8 .7 .0 .6 te a ea e u5 9 1 1 8 9 5 8 r p sS m 1 1 2 4 1 ts ro iser Eu les s dn ita vte p a c er ute o .5 .6 .8 .0 .4 .7 .3 .3 cy du thIn rg 4 6 3 1 0 2 1 61 2 120 s0 ie2 tr .3 .9 .5 .9 .7 .8 .6 s t,00 aP 4 – 02 6 41 7 01 9 trya enp sdn .)10 e d a 02 l 05 n :onm tann iaed .P, a9 o9 it e e m (,19910 -onN iittsnu .287 .456 .375 .151 .559 .628 .226 .381 lrseadﬁ i;ttrreem ,itrsaep .306***: ,ld l e n s =e a su yem roup leﬁdﬁ n Ise ito .ly lo g eissu ittu .3 .4 .5 .9 .1 .2 .4 .9 sno edp trse issusy n 1 4 2 4 4 7 7 1 e p te db I 7 5 6 8 4 3 7 6 su oo in anis tr ic )sseicilnoitargetle i;t m rop x o tm e n co asa nd ce tell a , au y ts tsf rtn n en dno e)%(tnamialcfoeyp o n n m aTle1ab lsseeﬁdu treaypon litrrceuug iitragom spoo isseonn itcaondu ireapnuo liillcseop :tssaeedoB ii:tragonm licaveoom liiitsceyvoT I M A Im rT P E E A N im (s (cDella Porta and Caiani The Europeanization of Public Discourse in Italy8 9institutional and non-institutional actors. When looking at which types ofactors make claims in public discourse according to the seven policy domainscovered in our research (see Table 1), we notice a decline in the presence ofcivil society actors in those ﬁelds in which the European Union has more formalcompetences. In the ﬁelds of monetary policy and European integration, insti-tutional actors monopolize the debate and civil society has a very low presence,with the partial exception of economic interest groups and parties. The rangeof actors involved in education and pension policies is more differentiated,with a signiﬁcant presence of civil society organizations. Nevertheless, thecorrelation between the degree of institutionalization of EU competences anda weak presence of civil society does not hold for troop deployment (low EUcompetence combined with a low presence of civil society actors) and agricul-ture (relevant EU competences but a signiﬁcant presence of civil society actors).In the debate on education, civil society actors are mainly constituted by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and social movements, whereas in thedebate on pensions the range of civil society actors is more evenly distributedbetween parties, economic interest groups and social movements. In terms ofEuropeanization, the data indicate that, in the Italian public discourse, issuesof European integration as well as those concerning monetary policy and troopdeployment are strongly debated within the institutional arena, whereasdiscussions on pensions and education, but also the already Europeanizeddomain of agriculture, are more pluralistic, involving a wider range of actors.When looking at claim-makers, it is worth noting that, among Europeanand supranational/transnational actors, institutional actors account for thevast proportion (88–94%). We ﬁnd very few civil society actors organized atthe EU level (6%) and, where present, they more often represent institution-alized economic interest groups than public interest associations and NGOs.Surprisingly, non-EU supranational civil society actors, as well as forms oftransnational linkages among civil society actors through multilateralcontacts, are more present (12%) than EU civil society actors. These ﬁndingsindicate the constraints on the emergence of a transnational civil society thatcould stimulate European integration from below, or at least high thresholdsfor such organizations to appear in the public domain.However, looking at the presence of European actors as claim-makers isonly one way to investigate the Europeanization of public discourse. Anotherindicator of Europeanization, although of a different type, is the choice ofEuropean institutions as the targets of collective demands. Table 2 shows that,overall, although national (and subnational) actors are still the main focus ofcollective mobilization and debate (58.3%), European actors and institutionsnevertheless have a role to play (17.9%). Even actors from other EU memberstates have some role as addressees of claims-making, whereas supranational90 European Union Politics 7(1)N8 8 1 0 5 2 68 4 0 2 8 4 3 d .08 7 2 1 3 6 n1 a.)10ia (Ped **m *, 1lanoit )an EUra -p nuS (nol se .04a .0 .0 .0 .0 .0 .0 .0 it 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 tr =o 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 a )T 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 p s, rte nn ai y.4 .5 .0 .3 .0 .1 .6 ic ite5 1 0 3 1 7 3 m c.5 .0 .5 .0 .4 .2 .9 , (U 5 9 7 0 4 6 7 ts eE 2 2 2 1 n p) e ty% l m r( ra ve tote o caail lm dtl ia anu co em s pi/ .0 .4 .0 .0 .3 .0 .8 ( oB 3 0 1 0 0 0 1 e c2002,0002,5 typ tse99 g1 l ) ro ra, tc t0 a U a n9 n E,s91d itaoN (-non .153 .35 .10 .58 .31 .119 .99 eapnd teeebwl oe ) c Vﬁ s s rr t ey e eilc b rag ramo la em t Cp n n ;)d o m e 1i e 0te ta U .0 .5 .0 .2 .4 .7 .5 tw .0c 1 5 5 9 3 6 8le N (E 1 1 ebe V (P:eS lan ) ’rse ***ptry itao ltay .57 .61 .21 .76 .94 .18 .13 ram .023to N I( 3 7 8 5 7 3 5 .C =c ly lda n eo ﬁly abl/ nte a iog c gr o e 2 8 4 5 2 0 5a L r 1t.3 .6 .4 .0 .9 .0 .2 ss isiehtfoepl sa pno rou tsl itocS ep aon ittu s tsg en s sed )rsl2eb ttryo iitttsu i-snon itreaP Itreen evomM iaedM ltrcao :tsaeB ttcaeoa c l o taT A In N A N sspu tcaoorg taet ts sre dono ilsoce icvs ee uu see ll bp iasam ravll efu thn do naDella Porta and Caiani The Europeanization of Public Discourse in Italy9 1and transnational (bilateral/multilateral) actors are rarely present. However,what is most striking in the comparison between types of actor is that civilsociety actors are signiﬁcantly less likely to address their political demandsto European and supranational institutions than are institutional actors. Theexceptions here are economic interest groups and the media, which frequentlydirect their claims to European addressees; parties show similar tendenciesto social movements.A cross-policy comparison of the scope of the targets of different typesof actor points to important differences. There is a strong presence ofEuropean addressees for both institutional and civil society actors on issuesconcerning European integration, monetary policy and agriculture. Incontrast, little attention is paid to the EU as a target of claims-making onissues of immigration and even less so on issues concerning education andpensions. A fairly similar picture of low European targeting emerges in thepolicy ﬁeld of troop deployment, although here civil society actors addresstheir claims to European actors much more often than institutional actors do.Another important indicator of the Europeanization of public discourseis the scope of the issues that are mobilized by claims. Issue scope refers tothe geographical and/or political scope of the substantive content of theclaim. The issue scope is in principle independent from the scope of thesubject actor, target and/or object, referring instead to the framing of ademand. For instance, if Amnesty International appeals to the EuropeanCourt of Justice in order to protest against the Milanese regulation that privi-leges Lombards whilst discriminating against immigrants, the actor is supra-national, the addressee is European, but the scope of the issue remains local.However, if a local Milanese committee, acting in defence of migrants, criti-cizes the Milanese city council for their migration policy on the grounds thatit constitutes a breach of the international conventions on human rights, thenthe issue scope is supranational, in spite of the local scope of the actor andaddressee. This indicator allows us to investigate the ‘salience’ of the integra-tion process in the everyday life of citizens: the question is whether the nation-state remains the primary focus for debates, discourses and the formation ofcollective identities, or whether, on the contrary, actors increasingly frametheir claims within a European dimension. In order to avoid overestimatingclaims with a European dimension, in Table 3 and the following analysesrelated (cross-time and cross-issue), claims in the ﬁeld of European integra-tion are not included, since their scope is by deﬁnition European.In claims made by institutional actors, issues are often framed withspeciﬁc reference to Europe, whereas in claims made by non-institutionalactors national references remain more important (see Table 3). However, thedifferences between the two types of actor in terms of the Europeanization of92 European Union Politics 7(1)5 9 7 9 2 1 40 9 0 5 6 7 0 d .03 8 2 1 4 2 nN 1 2 a.)10ia (Ped **m *, 5la .0 .0 .0 .0 .0 .0 .0 se .03t 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ito 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 r =T 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 a )p s, rl spu tcaoan o eo rg tait ) t tan EU re ds sra - te np n .8 .3 .9 .0 .1 .5 .7 in yauS (no 41 3 2 5 1 51 8 ic item cono ilsoce icv.9 .9 .2 .7 .0 .3 .4, (U 2 1 9 2 5 8 0 s eE 2 1 3 1 3 tn pe tyla m rr e o) e v tt o ca(% lait lm dlia anuc/m .1 .8 .6 .5 .0 .9 .5 so epi 8 6 2 2 3 3 1 ( oB 1 1 2 1 ep cs2002,0002,5 l )9 a U9 n E1 o -, it n0 a o99 N (n 3 4 0 10 4 5 31, )s srld ee bﬁla emyc nli o mio tp a U .1 .1 .9 .0 .4 .2 .1N (E 4 3 2 5 2 4 3d e.5 .7 .0 .7 .5 .6 .4 n wa tep ebo Vn ;)e 1e 0ed bet V (Plce la ’rs **e n ) e *:eS itao ltay .34 .26 .77 .03 .28 .31 .37 ram .023p N I( 3 6 6 4 7 3 .C =ty ly ldty eur sto isca ensc retw .0essu rami Cro lt ac l/ naa ioy c gb o e 3 7 4 3 1 1 5L r 1.2 .6 .8 .7 .2 .4 .0 ss isin eo ﬁs ee uu see ll bp iasam ravll efu thn do naeussifoepl sa pno rou tsl itocS ep ano ittu s tsg en s sed )rsle3b ttryo iitttsu i-snon itraeP Itreen veoMm ieadM ltrcao :tsaeB ttcaeoa c l o taT A In N A N sDella Porta and Caiani The Europeanization of Public Discourse in Italy9 3public discourse are slightly less evident than for the other previouslymentioned indicators. Amongst non-institutional actors, reference to theEuropean Union is very limited in instances of social movements’ claims-making but is much more present in the claims of economic interest groupsand the media.Yet here, too, there are signiﬁcant differences between the issue ﬁelds.Monetary policy and agriculture are often framed with speciﬁc reference toEurope (64.0% of claims with a European issue scope made by institutionalactors, and 56.8% of those made by non-institutional actors for monetarypolicy, and 44.2% and 30.6%, respectively, for agriculture). In immigration,troop deployment, pensions and education, however, claims referring to theEuropean Union are present at only a very low degree, especially in the claimsmade by non-institutional actors (4–9% institutional actors, 2–3% non-insti-tutional). Unsurprisingly, for pensions and education – ﬁelds that remainunder the full control of national political institutions – public debate is almostentirely concentrated within the Italian national space.4 Nevertheless, in theseﬁelds, especially that of pensions, a small but signiﬁcant portion of claims (inthe range of 7–9% for both types of actor) refers to other EU members.These results may be explained by the tradition of institutional, biparti-san support for European integration, as well as the weak structure of civilsociety actors, but the Europub.com research project conﬁrmed similar trendsin the other six countries covered (on the basis of as many as 20,000 politicalclaims collected from 28 newspapers). Across all countries, debates onEuropean integration (compared with those on the other issue ﬁelds) turn outto be highly elitist. State and party actors dominate every issue ﬁeld, butnowhere as strongly as in the debates on European integration, where 81%of the speakers are state or party actors (70% in the seven-issue average).Economic interest groups and other civil society groups are much less promi-nent in debates on European integration than in the other issue ﬁelds – respec-tively, 2% (against 10% on average for all seven issues) and 5% (against 11%for the seven-issue average) (Koopmans, 2004: 45).The slowly emerging Europeanization from belowThe Europeanization of public discourse seems, at ﬁrst glance, to reduce theopportunities for non-institutional actors: Europeanization appears to bemainly imposed ‘from above’. This is no surprise. Research on protest events,usually based on newspaper sources, stresses the scarcity of protests thatdirectly target European institutions. Using Reuters World News Service andReuters Textline, Imig and Tarrow (2001a) – the ﬁrst to analyse protest at the9 4European Union Politics 7(1)EU level – found a very limited number of such protests. Similarly, inGermany, Rucht (2002) has observed a low (and declining) proportion ofprotests aimed at the international level (the highest levels being reached in1960–4); he concludes that, ‘as far as Germany is concerned, the Europeaniza-tion and, more in general, Europeanization of protest is a myth’ (Rucht, 2002:185). Meanwhile Giugni and Passy (2002) noted how rarely protests onmigrants’ rights target the EU, notwithstanding the increasing Europeaniza-tion of decisions on migration, at least in terms of access quotas and bordercontrols. Even environmental action is very rarely aimed at Brussels: protestswith EU targets ranged from 0.8% in Italy to 4.6% in Germany in the pastdecade, with no discernible increasing trend (Rootes, 2002).Our data, however, point to a signiﬁcant and slowly growing adaptationamong non-institutional actors to the shift in competences and discourses tothe supranational level. In terms of targets and issue scope, the presence ofnon-institutional actors has indeed been slowly increasing, although not in alinear fashion, over the years in Italy (see Figure 2). In particular, whereasclaims with a national Italian issue scope have increased (although not in alinear manner) for institutional actors (from 20.3% of claims in 1990 to 42.9%in 1995 to 47.4% in 2000 to 35.7% in 2002), they have decreased for non-insti-tutional actors (from 71.6% in 1990 to 79.5% in 1995 to 65.8% in 2000 to 64%in 2002). Instead, it is the European level that has become more and moreprominent over the years, especially for non-institutional actors, who havetripled these types of claim in more recent years (from 4.5% in 1990 to 17.3%in 2000 and 15% in 2002, compared with institutional actors with 14.4% in1990, 15.4% in 1995, 23.1% in 2000 and 36.0% in 2002). Relatively little atten-tion, decreasing across the years, is paid to other EU countries by both typesof actor. Claims with an issue scope referring to other EU members repre-sented a share of 5.9% and 3.4% for institutional and non-institutional actorsin 1990, 7.1% and 4.1% in 1995, 3.8% and 2.5% in 2000, 0.3% and 2.5% in 2002.More precisely, in claims-making referring to Europe, economic interestgroups, social movements and the media in particular have increased theirpresence over the years (economic interest groups from 11.1% of all claims in1990, to 18.2% in 1995, 43.8% in 2000 and 42.4% in 2002; social movementsfrom about 3–4% of all claims in 1990, 1995 and 2000 to 12.0% in 2002; themedia from none in 1990, to 11.1% in 1995, 53.8% in 2000 and 15.4% in 2002).5The proportion of claims addressed to EU targets also increased signiﬁ-cantly between 1990 and 2002 for non-institutional actors, and at a higherspeed than for institutional actors. Whereas in 1990 and 1995 only the media,parties and economic interest groups addressed their claims to Europeaninstitutions, from 2000 onwards even social movements began to address theEuropean level; at the same time, other non-institutional actors were alsoDella Porta and Caiani The Europeanization of Public Discourse in Italy9 5EU target (civil society)EU target (state actors)EU issue scope (civilsociety)EU issue scope (stateactors)% 20403530251510501990199520002002Figure 2 Share of claims with EU scope (issues and targets) across time, by actortype.increasingly targeting the EU (e.g. 5.6% of economic interest groups’ claimshad a European addressee in 1995, growing to about 25–28% in 2000 and2002).6This growing ‘Europeanization from below’ does, however, follow apeculiar pattern. Applying our typology of forms of Europeanization to ourdata on claims-making in Italy (Table 4),7 we can see that, overall, the Euro-peanization of public discourse mainly assumes the forms of domestication(34.6%) and externalization (31.3%). Supranational dynamics are also relevant(24.6%), but transnational pressure applies to only 9.5% of cases. However, acomparison of institutional and non-institutional actors points to importantdifferences in the forms of Europeanization. Focusing on claims made by insti-tutional actors, supranationalization and externalization are equallydominant forms of Europeanization (representing 30.0% and 33.3%, respec-tively); domestication is slightly less signiﬁcant (26.9%); and the interventionof EU institutional actors targeting a member state is less frequent (12.5%), atleast in the ‘visible’ public discourse. If we focus instead on non-institutionalactors, we see that the prevailing type of Europeanization is domestication(55.8%) but that externalization is also important (33.3%); the presence ofEuropean social actors addressing either the EU (9.6%) or national govern-ments (1.2%) is much less frequent, although not negligible. In more detail,parties are most often characterized by forms of domestication in claims-making with reference to Europe (70.0% of all claims), whereas Europeaniza-tion via domestication covers about half of all claims among economic interestgroups, social movements and the media (46.5%, 53.4% and 42.4%, respec-tively). Finally, economic interest groups and the media are the most involvedin forms of supranationalization of public discourse (about 15% of all claims).9 6European Union Politics 7(1)Table 4 Forms of Europeanization of the public sphere by actor type (%)Scope of the claimantNationalEUType of actorNon-institutionalInstitutionalAll actorsNon-institutionalInstitutionalAll actors55.826.934.6Transnationalpressure (4)1.212.59.5Scope of the target—————————————————————————–National EUDomestication (1) Externalization (2)33.330.631.3Supranationalization (3)9.630.024.6N = 249N = 687N = 936N = 249N = 687N = 936Notes: Based on both samples, but including only cases with a European issue scope.

Cramer’s V between scope of the claimant and scope of thetarget = .23*** for all actors (N = 936); .32*** for civil society actors (N = 249); .18*** for stateactors (N = 687).As for the temporal trends in the types of Europeanization, domestica-tion has remained nearly constant across the years, representing about one-third of claims; externalization and supranationalization have increasedslightly in more recent years (34.5% and 28.0%, respectively, of cases in 2000and 30.7% and 27.4% in 2002, compared with a share of about 20–25% eachin 1990 and 1995). Domestication is typical of farmers’ protests: the majorityof farmers’ protests studied between 1992 and 1997 were aimed at nationalgovernments and occurred within domestic political spaces, even if theyconcerned European issues (Bush and Simi, 2001: 102). Comparative researchon Spain and the Netherlands has illustrated that farmers have continued tohold their national representatives responsible, even if these have insisted thatthe causes of the farmers’ grievances were beyond their control (Klander-mans, 2001). Cases of transnational pressure are stable at about 10%.Distinguishing the diachronic trends for different types of actor, we cansee that for non-institutional actors domestication was more common in thepast than in more recent years (moving from about 80% of cases in the 1990sto 45.6% in 2000 and 54.8% in 2002). Externalization slowly decreased for insti-tutional actors between 1990 and 2002 (remaining at about 30%), whereas itincreased for non-institutional actors (from 10.0% in 1990 to 40.8% in 2000 to35.2% in 2002). Transnational pressure is virtually absent for non-institutionalactors across the years, and it has remained at a nearly constant level of aboutDella Porta and Caiani The Europeanization of Public Discourse in Italy9 712–13% for institutional actors. Finally, forms of supranationalism increasedfor institutional actors (from 30.0% in 1990 to 37.0% in 2000 and 32.5% in 2002)but not for civil society.To conclude, non-institutional actors seem to have more difﬁculty in allo-cating resources in order to build European organizational structures.However, even if transnational civil society organizations are still rarelypresent in the Europeanized public discourse, the tendency to address the EUis not insigniﬁcant. The construction of community institutions, as well as thepolicies chosen by the EU, is increasingly the object of vigorous responses byloose networks of local, national and transnational actors.Consensual Europeanization or conﬂictualEuropeanization?Another relevant dimension to investigate is the degree of conﬂict in theprocess of Europeanization. That is, if we ﬁnd claims concerning Europe, arethey supportive or critical of the European polity, politics and policies? Thedevelopment of territorial politics follows both consensual and conﬂictualpaths. The nation-state evolved through conﬂicts of greater or lesser degreesof politicization between the centre and the periphery, between the churchand the state, with both cleavages contributing to shaping the characteristicsof national politics (Rokkan, 1982). The mobilization of other cleavages, inparticular social class divides, also contributed to the building of the nation-state, and the struggle to construct a national polity interacted with theproduction of national policies (Bendix, 1964). Conﬂicts can (and do) developaround both the very existence of a European polity and the speciﬁc policiesimplemented by European institutions. In this section, we shall investigatesome characteristics of consensual versus conﬂictual forms of Europeaniza-tion, comparing institutional and non-institutional actors.Many studies have indicated a decline in support for the EU in publicopinion, stressing the erosion of the ‘permissive consensus’ based on bureau-cratic legitimacy (Eder, 2000: 179–80). Together with the growth of protesttargeting the EU (Imig, 2004), the decline of trust in European institutions isan indicator of the weakening of EU legitimacy by ‘output’ legitimacy securedby the efﬁcacy of policy outcomes, rather than legitimacy secured by repre-sentative ‘input’ procedures (Scharpf, 1999).Our data conﬁrm a growing dissatisfaction with the functioning of theEU, but also tensions between different images of Europe, supporting thehypothesis that growing competences bring about increasing contestation. InTable 5 we show the distribution of conﬂictual claims by type of actor, in both9 8European Union Politics 7(1)domestic and ‘European’ claims-making.8 In the operationalization ofdomestic claims, we consider only those with a national issue scope (N =1332). Overall, the extent of conﬂictual claims is lower in European (28.6%)than in domestic claims-making (36.1%). Nevertheless, Europeanized conﬂict-ual claims have increased, although not linearly, over the years (from 21.2%of all EU-based claims in 1990 to 34.7% in 1995, 30.7% in 2000 and 27.1% in2002), whereas the proportion of conﬂictual claims in the domestic debateremained nearly constant at about one-third of the sample.We may add that civil society actors (in particular, social movements andparties) are much more conﬂictual than institutional actors, even in claims-making with reference to Europe. Conﬂictual politics may be more presentin national than in European politics, but the degree of conﬂict in claims-making has increased across the years in Europeanized policy ﬁelds.Contrary to the expectation that channels for including ‘civilized’ actors inEU policy-making would tame civil society organizations (see, for instance,Mazey and Richardson, 1993), non-institutional actors are more conﬂictualthan institutional actors even when addressing issues of EU scope, and theydo not appear to moderate their repertoire of action. Imig and Tarrow (2001a:43) also ﬁnd that, concerning repertoires of EU conﬂictual politics from 1984to 1997, conﬂictual actions continued to represent a substantial share ofclaims-making addressing the EU.In order to delve more deeply into the attitudes of different types of actor,Table 5 Conﬂictual claims by actor type in EU-based claims vs. non-EU-basedclaims: Selected policy ﬁelds, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2002Actor typeInstitutionalNon-institutionalPartiesInterest groupsMovementsMediaAll actorsEU-based claims—————————————Conﬂictual Totalclaims (%) (%) NDomestic claims———————————————Conﬂictual Totalclaims (%) N24.442.244.832.859.032.328.6100.0100.0100.0100.0100.0100.0100.012363891251168365162517.352.149.437.658.720.036.1100.0100.0100.0100.0100.0100.0100.0612720160101429301332Notes: Row percentages are shown.

Are the claims against any deepening of the integra-tion process, or do they imply an extension of the competences of Europeaninstitutions? Valence position scores on Europe/European integration rangein our coding from –1 (against a deepening of the integration process) to +1(in favour of deepening integration and the extension of the rights and posi-tions of European institutions and regulations; a 0 score indicates claims thatare neutral or ambivalent in this respect). In Figure 3, we show the score ofthe average valence position on Europe for each collective actor, calculatedby aggregating the position scores of that actor’s claims.9 The overall debatein Italy about Europe appears to be characterized by a positive attitudetoward Europeanization (+.24), conﬁrming other data about the pro-European sentiments present in Italian public opinion (della Porta, 2003c:20–3). In a cross-national comparison with the Europub.com countries, Italyranks third in support for the process of European integration (after Germanyand France) and is followed by Spain, the Netherlands and the UK(Koopmans, 2004: 45).Institutional actors have more positive attitudes towards European inte-gration, although their support for Europe is not characterized by a lineartrend over time. Civil society actors are in general less enthusiastic about theEuropean integration process, with an increase in support for Europe up to2000, followed by a sharp decrease. Among the non-institutional actors,economic interest groups have a slightly more pro-European position, andsocial movements and the media are more critical of European integration.In public positions on Europe, then, integration seems to be a project moredear to the political and economic elites than to civil society actors, who,1990199520002002Figure 3 Positions on European integration by actor type (mean values).0.400.30elu 0.20avn 0.10aeM 0.00–0.10–0.20State actorsPartiesInterest groupsMovementsMedia1 0 0European Union Politics 7(1)although not homogeneously, feel that they are on the losing side. In cross-national comparison, support for the integration process is everywherestronger among institutional and party actors (+.26 across all seven countries)than among various categories of non-institutional actors – economic interestgroups (+.12), the media (+.13) and other civil society groups (+.13). Thestronger socioeconomic actors (employers and business organizations) are, inmost countries, more supportive of the integration process (+.20) than aretrade unions (+.12). In Italy, unions emerge as particularly critical of theprocess in comparison with the more general European trend (–.13;Koopmans, 2004: 43).However, the support of every type of actor declines after 2000. In Italy,the cross-time analysis shows a decrease in support for Europe from +.30 in1990 to +.11 in 2002. Once again, this is similar to the general trend emergingin the other European countries covered by the Europub.com project: theaverage mean for support for Europe of the seven European countries fellfrom +.39 in 1990 to +.19 in 2002 (Koopmans, 2004: 43).The general attitudes towards Europe of the different types of actor varygreatly according to the issue under debate. In a cross-issue perspective, civilsociety claims on European issues that explicitly express a positive attitudeto increased Europeanization are at a high level for European integration(+.16) and agriculture (+.18). Education is the policy ﬁeld where non-institutional actors mostly express criticism on European integration (–.11).Institutional actors, in contrast, appear more cautious in supporting Europein claims-making concerning agriculture (+.07) and troop deployment (0.00),as well in debates concerning monetary policy (+.15).The attitudes of civil society actors towards the European process are alsostrongly differentiated across policies. Economic interest groups are morecritical of Europe when the debate speciﬁcally concerns EU integration (–.09)and more favourable when the claims-making concerns pensions (+.29), agri-culture (+0.18) or monetary policy (+.16). Social movements, in contrast,express more positive positions regarding Europe in the debate concerningEuropean integration (+.24) than when they talk about pensions (–1.00) oreducation (–.17).10Conﬂict related to the process of European integration is especially highon issues relating to the welfare state and social rights, where the EuropeanUnion is not considered to have a good track record. These results, whichconcern much more than the general process of European integration, there-fore seem to point to dissatisfaction among non-institutional actors with EUpolitics, conﬁrming the worry that a lack of ‘positive integration’ (Scharpf,1999) is weakening support for Europe among citizens concerned aboutwelfare issues.Della Porta and Caiani The Europeanization of Public Discourse in Italy1 0 1These ﬁndings on the conﬂictual participation of civil society actors maybe better interpreted by turning to the qualitative data generated from ourinterviews. The interview partners were asked about their general percep-tions and evaluation of the process of European integration, and how theyjudged the role and performance of EU institutions in this context (‘How doyou perceive the process of European integration more generally? What direc-tion is it taking? Do you agree with this development? And how do you seethe role and performance of EU institutions in this context?’). The analysis ofthe attitudes of various national actors towards Europe conﬁrms broadsupport for European integration, but in terms of very different conceptionsof Europe. Europe emerged as an ‘imagined community’ that meant verydifferent things to different collective actors. In the 1990s, in particular, theEuropean one was part of a multi-level territorial identity compatible withother territorial identities (Fabbrini, 2003: 19). But different actors also tendto construct different Europes. In part, these deﬁnitions overlapped with thetraditional distinction between Europe as an economic enterprise, based onthe pragmatic support of national economies (which appeared to be the viewcharacteristic of many institutional actors), and Europe as a federation basedupon a common destiny and common values, with a particular commitmentto peaceful interaction (which is the ‘model’ mentioned most often by non-institutional interview partners). For example, when considering actors’expectations and normative statements about the future of European integra-tion, institutional actors worried more about instrumental/economic issues(conﬁrming the image of a ‘regulatory’ Europe), whereas civil society actorsfocused on the political and social construction of Europe.From the instrumental point of view, enlargement and the euro areperceived by centre–right institutional actors and interest groups as challeng-ing decisions, especially in a period characterized by economic difﬁculties(see, for example, interviews 11, 12 and 1311). Enlargement, in particular, isconsidered to be risky by those who conceive of European integration asmainly legitimized by economic advantages – all the more so for a countrythat has, until now, enjoyed high levels of EU funding for cohesion policies.In the more Eurosceptic deﬁnition, enlargement is ‘an acceleration that doesnot take into account the problems of the assimilation of the member states’(Lega Nord, interview 14).Most civil society actors focused instead on identity issues – demandinga democratic and social Europe, but criticizing the EU’s weakness on bothissues. As for the ‘democratic deﬁcit’, many NGOs stressed the need for a‘bottom-up’ process to develop European politics. As the general secretary ofthe Movimento Federalista Europeo sums it up: ‘The EU Council is notgood because, from the point of view of constitutional doctrine, it is not a1 0 2European Union Politics 7(1)democratic institution’ (interview 1). Similarly, other social movementorganizations complained about the weak powers of the European Parliamentvis-à-vis the European Council (see, for instance, interviews 2 and 6), arguingthat ‘the construction of the European Union comes from the top and thereis no low level, except for the movements that attempt to inﬂuence ‘highpolitics’’ (interview 5).More generally, civil society actors are critical of the direction of Europeanintegration, but not on the basis of a traditional ‘nationalist’ Euroscepticismthat defends the nation-state (Marks, 2004). Criticisms are framed using thelanguage of class cleavages rather than territorial ones. Although socialmovement organizations agree on the importance of a European level ofgovernment and citizenship, they stigmatize EU policies as being orientedtowards economic success instead of social equality, ‘privileging the marketover the people’. As the spokesperson for Rete Lilliput, a network of NGOsworking on global inequalities, stressed: ‘We are favourable to the process ofintegration but we don’t agree with the political direction it is currentlytaking’ (interview 10). The representative of the ‘critical’ union Cobas (inter-view 3) conﬁrms this image of the EU as a neo-liberal institution, interestedin economic growth but not in social equality: ‘I disagree with the directionof the process of integration because it is primarily an economic, a ﬁnancialone. It is not integration by popular consultation’; a ‘Europe that liberalizesmore and more the free movement of commodities and dirty money but notpersons. It condemns thousands of citizens to death with its restrictive lawson immigration’ (interview 4).To summarize, the need to construct a supranational level of governanceis recognized but the weakness of political and social Europe is criticized.This tension between general support for Europe and criticisms of speciﬁcEU policies is acknowledged by, amongst others, the leader of the farmers’organization Altragricoltura, who stated:We are critical of the fact that integration is only a conquest of markets, and thatthere is no reﬂection upon what kind of Europe we want. The European Unionis the only opportunity we have for imagining a different model of economicdevelopment from the American one. We defend this possibility but we don’tagree with the reality of the European Union’s concrete choices; we are living acontradiction. (Interview 8)Our interviews with various types of non-institutional actors indicated,however, that although civil society organizations are more critical thaninstitutional actors (in terms of their position on increasing European integra-tion), such organizations (including social movements) have very high levelsof interest in the development of European policies and consider the EU levelDella Porta and Caiani The Europeanization of Public Discourse in Italy1 0 3to be very important for the present as well as for the future. Social move-ments express the least support for the European Union, but they show ahigher level of interest in it than political parties do; they share a fairly strongbelief in the relevance of the European policy level, and an even strongerconﬁdence in its future inﬂuence.The Europeanization of public discourse and civil society:Some conclusionsOur data indicate that, at least when looking at Italy, there is a certain degreeof Europeanization of public discourse in terms of the presence of Europeanclaimants, targets and framings of issues, but that this process has speciﬁccharacteristics. It is selective, insofar as it involves some policy areas but notothers; it is mainly top-down, in the sense that non-institutional actors areless present than institutional ones in public debates on Europeanized issues;and it is increasingly contested, in Italy not so much in terms of oppositionto a European polity (i.e. to the building of new geographical borders), butmore on the basis of speciﬁc European policies (in particular, the weaknessof social policies) and European politics ( the ‘democratic deﬁcit’ is linked notonly to the weakness of the elective EU body, the Parliament, but also to thelack of transparency of European integration processes) (della Porta et al.,2003; della Porta and Caiani, 2004; della Porta, 2003b). Other recent studieshave found similar results in other countries, indicating a certain generaldegree of Europeanization (Koopmans, 2004; Trenz and Eder, 2004) accom-panied by issue speciﬁcity (Seidendorf, 2003).Principally, our results have conﬁrmed that, in terms of political oppor-tunities, multi-level governance is reﬂected in domestic public discourse. Asexpected, Europe is more widely discussed in those policy areas where theEU institutions have more competences (especially in monetary policy), butsome degree of Europeanization also emerged in policies that remained morewithin the control of national institutions. Moreover, public discourse onEuropean actors and issues became more and more prominent over time.Even if European institutions function as an additional level of oppor-tunity, our research conﬁrms that the ability of collective bodies to accesssupranational levels depends upon their ‘regulative, jurisdictional andmaterial resources’, and that ‘European integration distributed these oppor-tunities of access to extraterritorial resources . . . in a differential and unequalway’ (Bartolini, 2002: 8; emphasis added). In Italy, although also in otherEuropean countries (Koopmans, 2004), acting at the supranational level seemsrelatively less expensive for actors that are already resource rich at home.

The higher level of reliance on institutional sourcesby journalists covering supranational issues also seems to play a role inlimiting the presence of civil society actors in these debates (Bennet et al.,2003). When looking at public discourse, it seems that the processes of Euro-peanization strengthen those who are already strong nationally, while furthermarginalizing the weak.Nevertheless, the growing Europeanization of claims-making by socialmovements and associations indicates that (although perhaps making a virtueof necessity) civil society actors realize that they cannot remain conﬁned totheir own nation-states. If decisions shift to the supranational level, thenclaims-makers must adapt accordingly and try to reduce their disadvantagesin addressing a new level of governance. For resource-poor collective actorsin particular, it seems important to combine different territorial levels of inter-vention by framing concerns in a more European dimension while simul-taneously holding on to potential allies in national politics.The Europeanization of public discourse does not imply increasingconsensus on the EU polity or policies. Our data indicate that European inte-gration also involves the interplay of territory and class (or, at least, left–right)cleavages, although not to the same extent as occurred during the construc-tion of the nation-state. The Europeanization process is, in fact, more andmore conﬂictual – including within public discourse. Together with thegrowth of protests addressing European targets (Imig, 2004), decreasingsupport for European institutions indicates the failure of output legitimiza-tion based upon results rather than input procedures. Long before citizens inFrance and the Netherlands voted against the European Constitution, opinionpolls had signalled a decline in citizen satisfaction with the development ofEU institutions, with about half of Europeans dissatisﬁed (Pache, 2001;Méchet and Pache, 2000), and European institutions are regularly criticizedfor being ‘bureaucratic, inefﬁcient and for lacking transparent procedures’ (LeTorrec et al., 2001: 8). The output of the EU seems insufﬁcient, if not negative,to many collective actors. In particular, with reference to the interactionbetween territorial and social cleavages, our research conﬁrms the presenceof a tension between a vision of Europe as promoting a regulated capitalismthat addresses social concerns and a neo-liberal vision that is opposed to theexpansion of EU competences and instead promotes deregulation (as stressedby Hooghe et al., 2004; Marks, 2004).Our research suggests that the growing criticism of the EU does not1 0 6European Union Politics 7(1)necessarily take the form of Euroscepticism. Even if, in Italy, support forEuropean integration tends to remain widespread, there has been a recentincrease in contestation of the direction of EU policies, particularly amongnon-institutional actors. Our research allows us to go beyond the observationof a growing scepticism in order to distinguish the image of Europe aroundwhich consensus and/or dissent emerges. The speciﬁcity of a ‘critical consen-sus’, especially on the Left, can be explained by the characteristics of theEuropean construction process and its inherent tension between instrumen-tal and identitarian images, which prevail, respectively, among civil societyand institutional actors. Ever since its beginnings, the EU has in fact been areaction to the weakening of the European nation-state in certain key areas –from the military defence of frontiers to the expansion of markets. As Bartoliniputs it, the process of territorial de-differentiation that is at the root ofEuropean integration ‘ﬁnds its initial inspiration in two elements of the newinternational constellation that followed on from the Second World War. Theﬁrst was the evidently intolerable cost of historical rivalry between theEuropean states in an era when the destructiveness of war technology hadgrown out of all proportion to what was at stake in said rivalry. The secondwas the growing pressure coming from the potential economic marginaliza-tion of Europe in the world economy’ (Bartolini, 2002: 405). The de-territori-alization of defence and the market that was the foundation of the Europeanconstruction stood, however, in contrast to the maintenance at the nationallevel of decisions over redistribution issues. Even more problematically,where member states have retained their competences on social policies (andin particular, as we have seen, on education and pensions, which are areasstrictly related to national integration), monetary policies (and the related‘stability pact’) have deprived national governments of some of their maininstruments for intervening in matters of social inequality.To conclude, our research conﬁrms that European integration demands ‘acommitment to construct a system, that involves the creation of at least a levelof cultural identity and of citizenship able to sustain the principle of socialsharing of risks and mechanisms of legitimate political decisions’ (Bartolini,2002: 412). The EU’s launching of campaigns on general ethical issues, such asgender equality, anti-racism and human rights (Trenz, 1999), is evidence of thesearch for a moral basis for a collective identity. Such a moral basis would beequivalent to what the nation represented in the construction of the state. Ourresearch singles out this need and the dissatisfaction with the EU’s responseto it, which is judged to be hopelessly inadequate.Della Porta and Caiani The Europeanization of Public Discourse in Italy1 0 7NotesWe wish to thank Claudius Wagemann for his dependable and patient help withstatistics, Sara Valenza and Linda Parenti, who collaborated on content analysisand interviewing, Lorenzo Mosca and Massimiliano Andretta, who participatedin various steps of the Italian project, the project coordinators Ruud Koopmansand Paul Statham, as well as all other members of all national teams.1 This article reports results from research carried out in Italy. The researchforms part of a larger cross-national project on ‘The Transformation of Politi-cal Mobilisation and Communication in European Public Spheres’(Europub.com), coordinated by Ruud Koopmans and sponsored by theEuropean Commission in the context of its 5th Framework Programme (HPSE-CT2000–00046). For an outline, see Koopmans and Statham (2002), availableon the project website at http://europub.wz-berlin.de. Integrated reports ofthe results of the claims-making analysis of the Europub.com project for theUnited Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzer-land, as well as separate reports on each of our seven countries, are availableat http://europub.wz-berlin.de/project%20reports.en.htm.The Appendix to this article containing the interviews can be found on theEUP webpage.2 The reliability coefﬁcient for the identiﬁcation and delimitation of claims was.89. For the variables used in this paper, reliabilities ranged from .85 to 1.00.3 In the following analyses we balanced the sample of claims from 1990 and1995 by assigning them double weight. Furthermore, because only half of thesample (namely 26 days when claims were coded for 1990 and 1995 and 52when they were coded for 2000 and 2002) contains all the articles found onthe selected issues, while in the other half of the sample (again 26 days forhistorical years, and 52 days for the most recent) only claims with a Europeanscope in at least one of the basic aspects of the claim (actors, addressees, issue)were coded, we based most of our analyses on full sample issues only. Bydoing this we avoid overrepresenting claims with a European dimension,thus drawing a fair picture of the degree to which ‘Europe’ is present in thenational public sphere. We indicate in the text when the reduced sample isadded.4 In general, as many as 83.5% (institutional actors) and 92.5% (non-insti-tutional actors) of all claims on pensions and about 90% (for both types ofactor) of all claims on education have a national, Italian issue scope. Monetarypolicy claims with a national issue scope account for a share of 9.5% for insti-tutional actors and 19.6% for non-institutional actors; claims on agriculturefor 18.6% and 44.4%; claims on immigration for 61.3% and 83.5%; and claimson troop deployment for 0% for both types of actors.5 For parties, claims with a European issue scope remain nearly constant acrossthe years (about 6–7%), with a signiﬁcant peak in 1995 (15.6%).6 Claims directed to other EU member states slightly decreased for state actors(from 15.0% in 1990 to 7.4% in 2002), whereas for civil society actors theyremained nearly constant at about 3–4%.7 For the typology and the related analyses, we considered only claims thathave a European issue scope, in order to obtain a data set of claims launched1 0 8European Union Politics 7(1)in response to the policies or institutions of the EU (EU-based claims).According to this criterion, we selected 1625 ‘EU-based claims’ from a totalof 3541 claims.8 We aggregated action forms into the following broad categories: politicaldecision/executive action, verbal action (e.g. communication events such aspress releases) and protest/direct democratic action. We considered asconﬂictual all those claims in which protest/direct democratic action wasused, plus all those accompanied by criticism of their targets. Indeed, callsand appeals for speciﬁc targets may be made either in a neutral sense or withexpressions of criticism or support for the actors they target. We measuredthe evaluation of addressees, giving a score of –1 for negative judgementsand +1 for support, with 0 for a neutral position.9 The attitude towards increased European integration (Figure 3) was recorded,for both samples, only for claims that had a European dimension in the issuescope. Position scores were computed only for cells with 5 or more cases.Overall, the mean for all actors during the period under study (N claims =1623) is +0.24 (+0.30 in 1990; +0.25 in 1995; +0.31 in 2000; +0.11 in 2002); forinstitutional actors +0.28 (+0.37 in 1990; +0.27 in 1995; +0.36 in 2000; +0.14 in2002), for social movements +0.10 (0.00 in 1990 and 1995; +0.19 in 2000; +0.03in 2002), for economic interest groups +0.14 (–0.11 in 1990; +0.30 in 1995; +0.21in 2000; +0.04 in 2002), for parties +0.10 (+0.17 in 1990 and 1995; +0.20 in 2000;–0.12 in 2002), and for the media +0.13 (0.00 in 1990; +0.17 in 2000; +0.09 in2002).10 Parties and the media expressed signiﬁcant support for Europe only in thedebate about European integration (from about +0.15 to +0.17); in all the otherpolicy ﬁelds they expressed neutral or ambivalent positions.11 The list of our interview partners can be found in the Appendix.References<ref>Bartolini, Stefano (2002) ‘Lo stato nazionale e l’integrazione europea: un’agenda</ref>di ricerca’, Quaderni di Scienza Politica 9(3): 397–414.<ref>Bendix, Reinhard (1964) Nation Building and Citizenship.
