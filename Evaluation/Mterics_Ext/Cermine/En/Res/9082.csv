The artwork is thus pro-duced through a process of participation. As a researcher, I was similarly expected to participate inthe artwork process. As I observed, the artists worked at having their agency in the artwork processrecognized by the participating spectators. At the same time, the artists create a certain proximity tothe spectators-participants through performing art, which I call "performing proximity." By involvingthe participants in their art-in-process, they make use of their agency to redefine the artworld andenlarge it into other social worlds. I also discuss how artists' ability to enact redefined social worldscan be compared to agency in performative social science and in biographical research.Table of Contents1.

"Learning to Fly" InterludeEverett HUGHES developed a strategy for his students to learn to "fly on theirown" in their field of research1 (PUNCH, 1998). This refers to an artwork bySerbian artist Tomislav VUKIC, who found a ventilator without blades in thestreet. He turned it into an object of art and called his work "learning to fly," a titleinspired by the song "Learning to Fly"2 by Pink Floyd. Learning to fly can be readas both a reflection of the stagnant political situation in Serbia, which was asenigmatic to him as his own existence as an artist, and his artistic development;that is, his ability to be an artist without "crashing". Only the title "Learning to fly"is underscored and, as it were, abbreviated by the work itself, which presents aventilator without blades or "wings."1 See also PARKER and SEDGWICK (1995) and HUGHES (1971).2 "Learning to fly" by Pink Floyd was released 1987 on the album "A Momentary Lapse ofReason", EMI records.© 2008 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung / Forum: Qualitative Social Research (ISSN 1438-5627)FQS 9(2), Art. 62, Felicia Herrschaft: Performing Proximity—"Learning To Fly"Image 1: "Learning to fly," Tomislav VUKIC, 2007 © [1]2. Performing ProximityMy research uses radio as an experimental space and employs participantobservation and interaction to reconstruct, through interactions with artists, theproduction of symbolic forms in the framework of a concept of a deliberativepublic sphere. In interview settings with artists, I accept how they communicatetheir own reality and how they narrate auto-biographical material. It is meaningfulhow they invent their realities and how these take on their own meanings.Increasingly, artists themselves are anticipating sociologists in finding ways intosocial worlds and preparing social worlds for the sociologists. In my view, theseprocedures of doing art-in-process present new challenges to the methodsemployed in order to understand artistic practices. Based on preliminaryconsiderations of the performative and participatory aspects of aestheticexperience, this article discusses the interrelationship between artistic productionand performative social science. I present two examples "Lawrence" and "Micky,"and discuss how aspects of biographical work can be connected with processualstructures of performative artistic practices. Proximity in the working alliance withartists gives the chance to reflect performative aspects in these practices of doingart and shows that reflections of approximation in performances are as importantas the articulation of the artist's autonomous position. I see these approaches inperformative research with artists as comparable with techniques withinperformative social science. [2]Within the framework of the generative contexts of artistic works, the artistundertakes the performative assertion and determination of a work in its fragility,because art works are performative themselves. Artists justify their work whilethey conceptualize it or if they install a work in a public space, they deliberate andexplain their concept and this is part of the process of doing art. Thesejustifications are more powerful today, as we have entered a process ofpermanent democratization and deliberation. Furthermore, these justifications© 2008 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 9(2), Art. 62, Felicia Herrschaft: Performing Proximity—"Learning To Fly"must be understood aesthetically as being as important as the role of theobserver. The fragility of language in the constitution of art works ought to beacknowledged,3 as ADORNO (1997) framed the ethical and humanizing attitudehe demanded from modernism's discourse on art, so to should the artistic agent'srole also be acknowledged. For example, what artists actually do through theirarts practice plays a role in academic and critical discourses, because thoseartists are the agents in the process of creating artworks. [3]What, then, do artists produce, and how is this related to performative socialscience? How is this question related to the manner in which sociological andaesthetic theory registers changes and transformations in order to redefine theinterrelation between art and science? In the next section I will elaborate the roleof performativity in both art and science. [4]3. Performativity in Art and ScienceArt and science have been seen as two different domains, apparently facing eachother in an opposition that has become obsolete. Similarly, conventional dualismssuch as private vs. public no longer apply to the dynamic acts of artists when thelatter present installation work and actions in exhibition spaces that invert life-worlds. Artists react to changed aesthetic experiences and reflect environmentsand landscapes of knowledge in their work. In MERSCH's view, art proves a "wayof thinking and research of its own, one that we must regard as an equal in itsown right of the natural sciences and of exact mathematics" (MERSCH, 2007,p.97; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). Art is a matter of technique. In today'srapidly changing world, with its new technologies and new forms ofcommunication, artists develop new domains of experience by creating, withintheir own system of reference, artistic forms of expression that have changed thissystem of reference, the "artworld4." And yet we understand these forms ofexpression because, as viewers, we are engaged in this form of participation inthese artistic processes. [5]When the philosopher AUSTIN described the distinction between "performative"and "constative speech acts" in "How to do things with words" (1962), heconsidered "whether he could find any grammatical criterion for distinguishing theperformative utterances" (ANDERSSON, 1975, p.5). ANDERSSON concluded"that he could not find any single simple criterion of grammar or vocabulary bywhich he could distinguish the performatives from other utterances [...] or thatmarks out the 'performative use' of them" (ibid. p.5). HANTELMANN states that"the same holds true for artwork. To speak of a performative artwork is tauto-logical, because there can be no non-performative artwork" (2007a, p.415). [6]The performative dimension of art does not address "the signifying character ofthe work of art [...] its factual existence here comes to the fore as significant, asthe point of departure for a potential of artistic action and assertion"3 See BUTLER (1997).<ref></ref>) reconstructed</ref>cooperative work with artists in "Artworlds."© 2008 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 9(2), Art. 62, Felicia Herrschaft: Performing Proximity—"Learning To Fly"(HANTELMANN, 2007a, p.415). The social aspect of ambitious art,HANTELMANN contends, is manifest in art with a performative orientation thathas turned toward social critique. Consequently, artistic positions such as thoseassumed by COLEMAN, BUREN, SEHGAL, and KOON abdicate the criticaldistance from society in favor of "a consciousness of participation (in society)"(HANTELMANN, 2007b, p.9; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). These artists"recognize a power over artistic action not outside of, but within the museumframe of art" (ibid., 2007b, p.9; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). They do notattempt to strive toward a break with the conventions of art, recognizing,"in those conventions, which govern the social interaction with art, an active power ofart directed at the social. [...] The work of art does not become something social inovercoming these conventions, thus the shared point of departure, but rather italways already is something social by virtue of these conventions" (HANTELMANN,2007b, p.9; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). [7]In contrast to the questions asked by HANTELMANN—"What kind of a situationdoes an artwork produce? How does it situate a viewer? What values,conventions, ideologies and meanings are inscribed in this situation?" (2007a,p.415) Meaning-production in art is not exclusively located in the artwork. In orderto better understand the performative aspects of art, we must look at artists'practices. It is in the doing that the performative is revealed. The context ofartworks is becoming increasingly complex and open to different interpretations inan open horizon of understanding. Art shows the objectivity of its elements in anintermedial way, because it is thematizing in itself the social, cultural and spatialcontext of its emergence."Instead of producing an identity, [works of art] are intelligible by power of theirfunction. Not what something is, that is what it constitutes, appears to be relevant, butrather how it happens in a performative way, and what effects it induces.Correspondingly, the art concepts assign to the arts a site that crosses all dimensionsof figuration and form. Specifically, this lends a new contour to the concept of art.What this means is that it is not what we get to see or hear that is most relevant—thespecificity of materials, the subtle changes of forms, the distinctions between sounds—but rather, the performance of a transitionality, a performance that requires activeparticipation and the acceptance [of] [by the spectators] immediate responsibility. Forit is not an underlying thing, nor again a structure, but rather a process" (MERSCH,2006, p.222; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). [8]The current debate in philosophical aesthetics over performativity no longerdiagnoses the relevance of orders of knowledge of social systems in the sameway that BERGER and LUCKMANN (1966) did in the "social construction ofreality." Rather, this debate examines orders of justification (BOLTANSKI &THÉVENOT, 2006), which suggest a shift of the systems of knowledge.According to SCHÜTZE, "the landscape of knowledge" has become "increasinglyconfusing: [...] ever more fluid, more multi-aspectual, more concurrent andcontradictory, more theoretical and reflexive" (2002, p.59; translated by GerritJACKSON). Since the 1970s, qualitative ethnographic studies have been© 2008 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 9(2), Art. 62, Felicia Herrschaft: Performing Proximity—"Learning To Fly"conducted in research settings in the natural sciences (for instance byGARFINKEL, LATOUR, LYNCH, and KNORR-CETINA), in order to detectpossible interdependencies and influences between highly technologicallydeveloped research procedures and the communication between researchers(MONDADA & SCHÜTZE, 2004). In order to examine the production of science inits own communicative contexts, such studies have addressed local settings ofwork and interaction as well as the contingent practices of action, interaction andcommunication. Such studies of the social world, as developed by symbolicinteractionists such as STRAUSS, have given rise to Actor Network Theory(ANT), ethnomethodology, conversation analysis, and the sociolinguistic analysisof communicative interaction. Studies of the social worlds of scientists haveenvisaged those activities "during whose performance the objects of knowledgechange," as concerning the "production, configuration, arrangement of technicalinstruments in research" or resulting from the inclusion of "concrete processes ofthe search for objects in research practice" (MONDADA & SCHÜTZE, 2004,p.141; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). The increasing reflexivity (LYNCH, 2000)of the practice of qualitative research is heightened by a reflection on theinvolvement of the researcher in the process of research. [9]Drawing on Actor Network Theory, sociologists such as LATOUR (1999a) showhow, through chains of translation within the laboratory situation, initialpropositions are transformed step by step so as to generate "facts." As the objectof a scientific discourse passes through these chains of translation, it must proveits permanence and resistance as a "network fact" while investigating naturalscience. LATOUR calls such a discursive object a movable immutable (mobileimmutable) if this object has become irreversible, having stabilized itself as anobject of knowledge (MONDADA, 2004). Thus, discursive objects, afterMONDADA, engender "a public version of the world by indicating its adequacy tothe intersubjective and social relations among the participants as well as to thesocial context in which this public version of the world is being framed" (2004,p.184; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). [10]LATOUR, a sociologist, works as a curator as well. Together with the curator,OBRIST, (mounting the exhibition "Laboratorium" or the distinction between theinside and the outside of a laboratory), LATOUR sees this work as "not so easyto trace anymore," because "we are all working more or less in a laboratory. If wedon't do experiments ourselves, others do experiments on us" (LATOUR, 1999b,p.185). Through its "Theatre of Proof"—a part of the exhibition, the audienceparticipated in the practice of science. The designated result was that "theaudience will have a better grasp of what to expect from scientific experiments"(LATOUR 1999b, p.185). My view on art and science is different, because Icreate a performative experimental situation in radio studios that is notcomparable with experiments in natural science in order to investigate how artistsinvolve participants in their art-in-process. [11]The concept of performativity in philosophical aesthetics is too firmly bound upwith a concept of works by performative artists that masks the fact that artists areboth those who realize their works and those who place this realization in a© 2008 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 9(2), Art. 62, Felicia Herrschaft: Performing Proximity—"Learning To Fly"historical context of becoming. Discourses about art and artistic procedures arenot characterized by communicative activities that discursively engenderdiscursive objects or aim to produce agreement on a public version of the world.In order to understand what art is, aesthetic theories have been developed thatresemble each other in that they examine art as their object. In addition,experimental art foregrounds the object-hood of its elements and thus worksacross media, addressing spatial, social and cultural contexts. The exhibitionspace becomes part of the art, just as the viewer's recognition is constitutive of thework. Modernist theories of art that are based on the presumption of the autonomyof art no longer comprehend the hybrid formations within its resultant works.These hybrid formations in contemporary artistic production indicate a paradigmshift, seen by REBENTISCH, not as a radical renunciation of modern categoriesand specifically of the category of aesthetic autonomy, but rather "as adeterminate negation of a specific notion of aesthetic autonomy, a notion, to beprecise, that is understood in objectivistic terms."5 [12]This is, according to REBENTISCH (in HERRSCHAFT, 2004, p.2; translated byGerrit JACKSON), an understanding of art"in which the object is conceived as independent of the viewer and the context, sothat a different understanding of aesthetic autonomy can result from it. To that extent,art, as it were, challenges philosophy to revise this central category of its discourse,namely, the category of autonomy." [13]The aesthetic experience of art cannot occur outside of the viewer's experientialstructure. It is a specific process that is not localized within the subject alone butrather in the tense relationship between subject and object. In REBENTISCH'sview, installation art develops socially relevant lines of questioning and rejectsideological imputations that the latter are an instrument of debates over identitypolitics or social theory, contributing to a discourse analysis—imputations thatproceed to negate art as art."As art works, they differ from all of this by being constitutively open in their meaning.Neither for the works nor for their individual elements can we identify one singledefinitive context that could guarantee a conclusive understanding of them"(REBENTISCH, 2003, p.275; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). [14]The tense relationship between a representation and that which is represented isindissoluble, and enters into a specific process of understanding that, far fromdisposing over it, is an experimental process. It seems as though a conversationhas begun in the meantime between artists and their interpreters because artisticworks have become interactive and performative. Yet, is this conversation trulytaking place? Are discourses about art being developed in collaboration with theartists? Or is aesthetics, in the end, still nothing but the regime serving theidentification of art, as RANCIÈRE (2006) calls it, so that art can be designated5 Juliane REBENTISCH, interviewed by the author (HERRSCHAFT, 2004, p.2). This interviewwas conducted during an experimental public space "Exit and Voice" held at TAT (Theater amTurm, Frankfurt) in 2004. It is documented at http://www.fehe.org/.© 2008 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 9(2), Art. 62, Felicia Herrschaft: Performing Proximity—"Learning To Fly"as art when it has spoken out as socially relevant and questions if art is societalcommitment or not? Aesthetic objects can in no way be defined outside of adiscourse; in this definition, they engender their substantial content by virtue ofwhich they are integrated into the subjects' processes of understanding. "Evenmore: aesthetic experience seems capable of attaining a certain intensity, andhence also quality, only when the contents that are put in aesthetic play are ofimport to the experiencing subject" (REBENTISCH, 2003, p.279; translated byGerrit JACKSON). Due to the import of the aesthetic experience, one can saythat art works are constitutively processual. This processuality is constitutivelyrelated to the aesthetic experience. If artistic action is distinguished byparticipation, since it is only through the inclusion of the viewers that the artisticwork is constituted, then artistic modes of action and the entanglement of artisticproduction in the social world are of decisive importance to an understanding ofartistic productivity. Because of their own cognitive interests, performative artistsdoing experimental art, have become migrants between these two worlds."Art ought not to wish to apologize for its being constitutively associated with apractice that is capable neither of direct translation into action nor of immediatetransformation into cognition. Art opens up a specific experience; an experience, tobe precise, of distance, of an unsettling of the interpretive approach to the aestheticobject. In a certain respect, this distance indeed manifests a distance of the aestheticfrom practical or theoretical purposes" (REBENTISCH, 2003, p.279; translated byGerrit JACKSON). [15]4. Performativity in Interviews with Performative ArtistsNarrative interviews with artists in radio studios do not fit the classical template ofqualitative sociological research. Given the intermedia working alliance on whichthese interviews are based, one may see parallels with the procedures ofperformative social science studies. The latter are understood as performance(JONES, 2006) enacted in the practice of doing and performing reflexiveinterviews (DENZIN, 2003, p.200). DENZIN understands the performative to be"the present moment [...] defined by a performative sensibility, by a willingness toexperiment with different ways of presenting an interview text. The performativesensibility turns interviews into performance texts, into poetic monologues. It turnsinterviewees into performers, into persons whose words and narratives are thenperformed by others" (DENZIN, 2001, p.25). [16]According to JONES, performative social science is "a science that includes moreemphasis on collaborations with our research participant co-authors, co-producers or co-performers themselves" (JONES, 2006, p.7). [17]Recognition of proximity in forms of life and a critique of traditional forms of lifeare starting points for cooperative work with performative artists because thoseartists establish an egalitarian relationship with anyone who seeks to investigatethem. Their claim to autonomy means that they cannot be made into an object ofresearch. Autonomy is, in my understanding, getting stronger because of the way© 2008 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 9(2), Art. 62, Felicia Herrschaft: Performing Proximity—"Learning To Fly"artworks are changing and the way artists invent social interaction as part of theart world. In the following, I show parallels of how a researcher can understandartistic worlds and how this can be related to performative social science. [18]4.1 Lawrence: Performing biographiesThe interview with Lawrence6, a 24-year old artist from England, was conductedas a live broadcast at a radio station7. A day earlier, he had executed a liveperformance at the same studio. The interview refers to this performance and tothe family stories that were integrated into the artist's performance, runningsimultaneously with a slide show, and presented as the objects of a narrative.During the radio performance, the narrative itself became the object of the artist'spresentation as he started to accelerate the narrative again and again and, at theend of the piece, summarized the narrative, which had been developed over thecourse of an hour, in one minute, as though in time-lapse. During the interview,descriptions and argumentation predominated. Based on the description, animage emerges of what artists like Lawrence do and how artists proceed in theirwork. [19]The process of reflection on the artist's own work as an analysis of the work, isinterwoven with the material, and a reality in its own right is constituted. Theartistic position, which also contains autobiographical material, playfully andinventively alters it. This permits the reconstruction of the knowledge-producingprocedure that engenders an artistic position. MANNHEIM (2005/1936) callsintellectual processes that are inventive-altering inventive thinking. With respectto the performative character of the interview with Lawrence, this can beunderstood as an explanation of artistic cognitive processes.8 For Lawrence thisprocess consists in searching and finding. He explains this as another form oftranslation:"but I do—I do do watercolour paintings as a part of one project which is the 'Findingin ... In Search of ... project', and one of the main themes in this whole work wasabout translation and different methods of translation and how can that beincorporated in daily activity, thus watercolour painting was also another translation"(Lawrence, 2006 II.24-27). [20]By describing how he creates an artwork, his biography is performed andintegrated into his process of presentation. In earlier artistic forms, this occurredonly in the form of autobiography (for instance, in GOETHE's "Dichtung undWahrheit" ["Poetry and Truth"] (1981/1830), but did not become a central mediumof presentation. Here, it is addressed as a problem within the narrative. The6 Anonymized. Radioshow from 2006.7 For the history of radio in Germany see also HAGEN (2005).8 "In any case, this stage proves that the capacity for abstraction springs from a higher level ofactivity than that of chance discovery—i.e., from the stage of inventive thinking" (MANNHEIM,2005, pp.206-207). See also BARBOZA (2005), where she describes the experimental forms ofscience in MANNHEIM's understanding of sociology. I would suggest here MANNHEIM'ssociology as an early approach to PSS.© 2008 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 9(2), Art. 62, Felicia Herrschaft: Performing Proximity—"Learning To Fly"distinction between the author and the bearer of the narrative becomesproblematic. Lawrence communicates the identity of an artist and a narrator whopresents himself to the public, and simultaneously that of someone who hasauthentically experienced something, who is the bearer of the story. The frame ofargumentation is rendered conscious to the point of an explicit experience andthe development of an authentic artistic identity. Ordinary daily activities, whichhad previously been masked are employed, and connected to his frame of trans-dispositions, a procedure that can be understood as an archeology of theframework, as the performance uses interlocking and alienated perspectives inorder to generate a more authentic picture of Lawrence's work. MERSCH callsthese forms of action archeologies of the performative: [21]"The creative act itself, as it suddenly emerges from processes of intermediaperformance" (MERSCH, 2006, p.222) is an assertion of artistic actions.Concepts begin to supplant the mere image, and this must be understood as anact of liberation. "Such assertions, as events, are irreversible: once they havebeen put forth into the world, a fissure appears in them that rests on a force thatcannot be undone, one that simultaneously evokes the possibility of a 'differentbeginning' " (ibid., 2006, p.222; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). [22]The spectator/participant is enabled in order to engage in processes ofunderstanding during the performance. Artists like Lawrence shift thepredetermined frame like white cubes in galleries or museums spaces anddevelop their own mechanisms in order to find and mediatize their own discursivearenas. To this end, artists choose their own historical perspectives on theirprocedures in order to identify traditional notions of art and transpose their worksinto new paradigms. They have a need of their own historiography in order todefine for themselves their position within art history, and to interrogate it withrespect to formal circumstances.9 [23]Lawrence contemplates fragility in saying,"If I said, for example, if I sit in this institutional space and I perform, not to say that isa form of an emotional or intimate exchange but, uhm, I think it really does—it shiftsnot only the meaning of the work but also only one thing that is definitely in questionis the fragility of it. For example, the project, it is very delicate and fragile now if Ifunnel it through a medium such as radio it completely shifts what you could say theessence of it and at the same time things like repetition or these performativeapproaches can easily be executed and used very well through something like radio.But things such as a personal sentiment or a very kind of fragile narrative or complexitycan only be spent upon and developed basically through an engagement with someonewho is also reciprocating that" (2006, II.362-372). [24]9 "But there are other phenomena as well that—such as Georges Mathieu's informel—must beunderstood less as themselves than as documentation or traces of a creative act, traces inwhich a handwriting is manifest and that address their production as the act of an individual,lyric subjectivity" (IMDAHL, 1996, p.135; translated by Gerrit JACKSON).© 2008 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 9(2), Art. 62, Felicia Herrschaft: Performing Proximity—"Learning To Fly"A difference10 is moreover being produced that cannot be understood simply asactivity. In this difference, the presence of the work is manifest. Lawrencesustains his narratives within the interrelation, or framing (difference), of facts andstories. [25]In the following section of the interview, Lawrence begins to ponder theconditions of the constitution of his own work—to survey them."And if you bump into me in a train station or in a bus or strolling through a galleryand I perform a story ... there is always a framework, the framework is the bus or theframework is the gallery, but the point is the framework does not make a specific kindof relationship to my biography, it doesn't say 'on the bus between these hours'.Lawrence will perform a story to you" (2006, II.379-383). [26]An institutional framework such as a radio broadcasting studio can destroy thesituation of narration, one that is for him very fragile and intimate, because thenarrator is identified with his biographical data. The performative act of the workcan be destroyed because the reciprocity and the direction of the narrationtoward a listener is absent, even as listeners are present. The rhetorical assertionof narrative thus vitiates the narrator's disposition. [27]In the radio situation, Lawrence experiences the disappearance of his ownpresence as an artist. His explanation for this disappearance resembles thesituation he experienced during his studies when he sought to overcome theflatness of his photographs by telling stories while standing next to the slideprojector. The reflection on his presence, as he reclaims the latter, is part of hisartistic becoming:"I like that, but in the radio, that notion of fact and fiction of how do I come to this? It isgone, because it is obvious I am coming into your life, because you are driving a carlistening to the radio, you are switching on and you hear it and who did that that it wasthis guy, bang—it is over, it kills it in some ways" (2006, II.405-408). [28]Justifying, defending, and pondering in which context and under which conditionsa work can be staged or sold is part of the economic order of the art world, anorder toward which Lawrence, as an art student, cannot but take a position. Awork in a medium such as the radio broadcast is accessible to many listeners. Atthe time of the radio broadcast, the market potential of the performance wasunclear; Lawrence refused to make the broadcast available for download from theInternet. Not until half a year later was a limited edition record of the performanceproduced as part of an exhibition. Lawrence apprehension was that hisperformance could become liable to exploitation by the culture industry11.

See also JONES:"In addition, revisiting the collaboration between the narrator and researcher within ourbiographic investigations also deserves to be fore grounded in a 'performative' way, to includeinvolving research participants in the production and dissemination of their own stories" (2006,p.7).11 See also THURN (1973, 1979).© 2008 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 9(2), Art. 62, Felicia Herrschaft: Performing Proximity—"Learning To Fly"other hand, Lawrence seeks to legitimize his own work with justifications and toprotect it against the public interpretive forms of art criticism. [29]4.2 Micky: Performing a sphere of approximationMicky12 is an 34 year old artist from South Africa. We met the first time at a radioshow organized by an art student who curated an art students' exhibition. Whenthe show started, the students were drinking beer.Image 2: Art students in a radiostudio, 2007 [30]IDRIZI, a photojournalist from Prishtina, was invited to the radio studio as well tomake some images of the participants. The curated exhibition was about stars.They made a postcard and a catalog with drawings. Each participant createdher/his own star. In the radio studio, they felt and behaved like stars. Some hadprepared sound works and some played music as well. The six participants in theshow presented their works one after the other accompanied by comments,laughing and shouting as they progressively became drunker. A female artist hada sound work on DUCHAMP: she played a recorded wee-wee and the audiencelistened to it as a gender critique on the male form of the work "Fontaine" fromDUCHAMP.When Micky presented his work, a performance in a shopping center in Frankfurt,he was interrupted by another art student who was speaking louder and louder intranslating his English phrases into German as he tried to explain his artwork.12 Anonymized.

"I used to go on walks in the early 1990s I used to go for like fourdays, wake up in the middle of the night and then go for a walk, you know, outinto the bush, out of the town and that was a few times when I used to writepoetry about my experience, the homeless people I would meet, I gave like oneman on the street everything I had, you know, a jacket, everything" (Micky, 2008,II.139-141). After he came to Germany, Micky tried to sort out his position in theworld by defining "who" he was. It was when he went to a drawing course that herealized his need for this "definition." For example, it was through his art practicethat he could connect his first performances as an artistic practice:"... and today, knowing more, I realized that this could be interpreted as performanceof course, I didn't see the connection I think that I mean I don't want to put too muchfocus on the walks because they weren't very many of them and this is just anexample for my first kind of what I would now think about my artistic entranceperhaps" (Micky, 2008, II.212-217). [33]A performance for Micky allows him to test his own boundaries. Thus, he isasking the public for 10 seconds of their time, to perform. "How much do I needand of course how much space do I need but the focal one it was me" (Micky,2008, II.294-295). [34]Importantly, Micky realized that it was through artistic expression as performancethat he could transform himself. At the same time, Micky also realized what art isfor him: "... a personal transformation which automatically becomes a socialtransformation" (ibid. II.187). He is now doing performances as his main genre ofwork; this is because it is possible in a performance to create mirrors for theparticipants. Very important for the notion of proximity is that someone has tocome to him, he is waiting; this is automatically reflected in that observers of hisperformance are part of the performance and he is reflecting whether they need itor not: "if I place myself in the public a social need is there, it will be addressed bythe person who comes to me, otherwise they wouldn't come to me" (Micky, 2008,II.226-227). Micky realized in doing performances that he is positioned in andpossibly positioned against the art world. For example, he felt increasingly boredseeing the same kinds of exhibitions. For him, art has many functions and herejects being another artist who is over intellectualizing art works while ignoringthe transformational power of performative art. "For me to create something Ibelieve in transformational power of everyday things like taking the U-Bahn or likegreeting your neighbor" (Micky, 2008, II.268-270). The artwork is for Micky themoment one person has with him: "May be it is 20 seconds or it is ... and then it isgone. And it is always there and then gone it is like a heartbeat it comes and itgoes, it is a kind of a social rhythm it is a kind of a rhythm" (Micky, 2008, II.281-283). [35]13 See also the explanation in DENZIN (2003) of the call to performance in addressing matters ofracial injustice. The demand for a critical pedagogy lies for him in "a performative, pedagogicalpolitics of hope [that] imagines a radically free democratic society, a society where the ideals offeminist, queer, environmental, green, civil rights, and labor movements are realized" (2003,pp.5-6).© 2008 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 9(2), Art. 62, Felicia Herrschaft: Performing Proximity—"Learning To Fly"Thanks to participatory approaches, the artistic sphere is no longer dependent ontraditional models of representation. "They are not so much about the vicariousillustration of a problem, an [aesthetic] experience, or an idea of a community, butrather about directly realizing a multidisciplinary cooperation" (HÖLLER, 2007,p.410). Consequently artistic processes of proximity and participation havemoved increasingly into the foreground in the production of works. "Participationincludes the entire spectrum of behaviours a recipient can exhibit towards anobject, project or exhibition ambience" (ibid., p.410). The participatory claims inthe works of artists have become essential to an understanding of a participatorypublic. "Participation in its current form aims to create new collectives and tocreate ephemeral communities of action and interest, without an ongoingidentificatory basis" (ibid., p.410). What is sublated in the question of artisticparticipation is the distance between artistic modes of action and the recipients.The question of participation is a consequence of a changed understanding of thepolitical, with renewed and urgent importance. Participation, representation, andconstitution are interlocked; according to GERHARDT (2007), they form a trianglewithin which the political moves. This political notion is engaged in a process ofboundary dissolution, thereby moving toward its own margins. This form ofboundary dissolution is comparable to the delineation and critique of theVerfransung [marginal blurring or wandering] of the arts given by ADORNO14 inhis essay "Die Kunst und die Künste":"The Verfransung of the arts is a false demise of art. Its inevitable illusory characterbecomes scandalous in the face of the overwhelming power of an economic andpolitical reality that transforms the aesthetic appearance, even as an idea, into amockery because it no longer permits any perspective toward the realization of theaesthetic content. This is less and less compatible with the principle of rationalcommand of the materials with which that content had allied itself throughout thehistory of art" (ADORNO, 2006, p.208; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). [36]5. ConclusionReflexivity and heightened complexity are recognizable features of the institutionsof art, art schools and museums, and of exhibition practices. The substantivecontent of artistic work is measured by knowledge of institutional practices and byhow artists reflect and transform these practices in their works. Oneemancipatory move that artists are currently engaged in consists of addressingtheir knowledge of the means necessary in order to have their own history asartists and artistic agency recognized in this process. Moreover, given theincalculability of the art system, strategies of action such as the creation ofnetworks of informal relations are being developed in order to compensate foruncertainties. The engagement of the artist's own cognitive interests becomes asocial marker of his or her professionalism and of the performativity of the workscreated. ALHEIT understands aesthetic reflexivity as a potential present whenautobiographical texts show references to aesthetic experience and to aestheticprocedures. "Aesthetic reflexivity" has become, for ALHEIT and BRANDT, "an14 See also ADORNO (1997) and de DUVE (2006).© 2008 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 9(2), Art. 62, Felicia Herrschaft: Performing Proximity—"Learning To Fly"exemplar of distance and approximation, of the autonomization of aestheticexperience and of a renewed ties to other orders of experience" (2006, p.302;translated by Gerrit JACKSON). The substantial novelty of this form ofautobiographical self-presentation resides in the fact that "the question regardingthe type of autobiography becomes a matter of little importance" (ibid., p.25;translated by Gerrit JACKSON). The self-presentation of one's life stands at thecenter of literary autobiographies no longer subsumable under existing patternsof order, offering "instead the potential to develop substantially new forms" (ibid.p.25; translated by Gerrit JACKSON). According to ALHEIT and BRANDT, theconfiguration of the orders of knowledge has changed, and relationships with theworld and with oneself are capable of an expanded perception on the basis of thepotential space of biographical reflexivity. Questions of one's own socialresponsibility and connectedness thus come to the foreground. "Aesthetic reflec-tions are integrated within other orders of reflection, and only this gives rise to theentirety of the pattern that is here called aesthetic reflexivity" (ibid., p.298;translated by Gerrit JACKSON). [37]The fact is that, after the modern individual has been rendered capable of beingdefined, identity is a characteristic of social change. Lawrence takes this up in hiswork by addressing biographical points of reference and pointing out the socialconstructedness of these points of reference through the interruptions andaccelerations he employs during his narration. This reality is transitive becausethe mode of narrative is performatively used to establish a communicativesituation involving the listener-viewer that is open to subsequent communication.This process does not resolve into an act of interpretation, but into participation inhis performance. Micky justifies his role as a performer in creating a space for theautonomy of his artistic position. For both Lawrence and Micky, the approximationto the performance and how the audience is coming to it could be destroyed ifthere is too much proximity or too much intellectualization about what they aredoing as well as through over-interpretation of their works. A rupture would thendestroy the relation to simple everyday interactions and understanding of art. Inthis direction, definitions of art could learn to fly. [38]What does the artistic interaction with one's own biography and understanding ofperformative art show? The power of art to resist an analytic approach; a powerthat consists in breaking open the frameworks of research, and thus securing theautonomy of a work that is not at anyone's disposal. With respect to theintersection between biographical research, interpretive social science, andphilosophical aesthetics, "learning to fly" means adopting a perspective such asthat developed in performative social science so that conversations with artistscan begin. I see here one precondition for a more substantial working alliancewith artists that, rather than limiting itself to cultural-industrial critique, seeks tounderstand social change explained by artists.
