Partly based onthe fear that she will get self-alienated and “petrified” likethe older women with whom she dwells and works togetherHülya accepts a pre-arranged marriage (probably mainlynegotiated by her mother) as the only way out of her pre-dicament. But willy-nilly Hülya must learn that she—alrea-dy embarked on her way to an individualized and emanci-pated existence—cannot live in such a superimposedarrangement, and therefore she distances herself from herhusband through the biographical escape action schemesfirst of returning to Germany alone and then of pushingahead her divorce.1. Introduction: Common and Unique Features of Hülya’sLife History-The interview with Hülya shows numerous aspects of life histories of Turkishmigrant workers coming to Germany, which we consider as typical for theorganised work migration to Germany in the sixties and early seventies. But italso shows features, which are unique and outstanding. Common structuralfeatures are, for example, the institutional processing of the workers by therecruiting, examination and selection strategies in Turkey and the intake andexploitation strategies by German firms (in Germany). Of course, all of thesestructural features are connected with deep experiences of extended suffering:of being dehumanised by the selection and intake procedures; of being alien-ated by not understanding the language and culture of Germany; of being her-metically isolated; of being the despicable marginalized stranger, who doesn’tunderstand anything of importance to Germans; of being emotionally and mor-ally disoriented by being a cultural hybrid; of doing hard industrial work whichone is not used to yet; of feeling estranged from oneself; of getting sick byexhaustion; etc.—But there are some other features in the interview with Hülyathat are not as common as the just mentioned features. These other featuresinclude:-Hülya comes to Germany in 1972, when she is extremely young (shejust turns 17 years old, and she still is almost a child at the time of herarrival);Hülya is a young woman, who migrates to Germany all by herself; andshe continues to stay alone as a marginalized person during the entirefourteen-year period of her work and residence in Germany up to thetime of the interview;108- for one year—i.e., in her first year in Germany, when she is on contractwork in a slaughter house for chicken—her work reveals not just thenormal type of exploitation and estrangement features of the underpri-vileged migrant worker’s occupational situation in general, but, inaddition, the features of compulsory work as typical for concentrationcamp or slave labour organisations. This might be closely connected toher biographical condition of being an inexperienced, shy and veryyoung woman, who does not speak the language and from whom, there-fore, the employer and his plant organisation do not expect any type ofsystematic resistance;- nevertheless: during her long stay in Germany, Hülya emancipates her-self from her rural family background and dares to speak for herself andthereby overcomes a disastrous biographical crisis situation; she ac-quires an emancipated and individualized personal identity;- but most important is the following extraordinary feature: Hülya’s in-tention to come to Germany is linked to an unbearable material con-dition in which her family lives. She attempts to free her family fromthe burden to care for her as the dependent youngest daughter, and, inaddition, she even intends to help her mother, father, and siblings—inso far as they are still dependent—out of their poverty-relatedpredicament and of humiliating dependence on her oldest brother (whotook over the family household) by earning enough money in Germanyto support the family.Putting the common and the unique features of the life history of Hülya to-gether: Hülya develops an attitude regarding the course of her marginalisationand cultural hybridisation, which shows many features of productive individu-alisation. The question is how Hülya would acquire her remarkable competen-cies for individualizing biographical work taking into regard all the disastrousdifficulties of her life history.2. Biographical Processes in the Life History of Hülya.Biographical Processes up to the Life Episodes of a Pre-arranged Marriage and the Way out of it Through DivorceIn order to understand the mixture of uniqueness and common features inHülya’s life history that is mainly patterned by her work migration to Germany,it is necessary to briefly recapitulate the biographical processes and the mostimportant phases of these biographical processes in her life history. This short-ened version of her biography is methodically grounded on the analytical pro-cedures of text sort analysis, structural description, and analytical abstraction(SCHÜTZE 1983, 1984). Text sort analysis looks at the features of ongoing109interaction in the interview situation and at the differential involvement of thecommunicative schemes of narration, description and argumentation in theinformant’s follow-up of the line of rendering of her or his personal experi-ences. Of particular interest in this stage of analysis are background construc-tions (SCHÜTZE 1992, 2001a), which deal with disorderly chunks of bio-graphical experience, and argumentative commentaries (SCHÜTZE 1987,1991a), which express biographical work of the informant. Structural descrip-tion is the analytical procedure, by which the unfolding of the story telling inits formal textual features is articulated1 and at the same time the unfolding ofbiographical processes is sequentially followed up and delineated (SCHÜTZE1981, 1984, 1991, 1994, 1995, 2001b). Most important is the analytical activityof “pragmatic breaching”, which envisions the formal and substantive featuresof the autobiographical text as expressions of a recapitulation of re-enacting oreven “re-enlivening” (formerly) evolving biographical process structures thatthe informant has been involved in. One basic step in the analytical abstractionis the integrated follow-up of the sequential order and/or simultaneous conflictof the supra-segmental units of the narrative text; these lump together narrativeunits into integrated biographical contexts that reveal stretched-out biographi-cal process structures. The aim is to reach an empirically grounded concept ofthe overall biographical structuring of the whole life history as told in the auto-biographical narrative interview (SCHÜTZE 1981, 1991, 1994, 2001a). In thisfollowing article a full application of the analytical apparatus cannot be articu-lated. However, I articulate my understanding of the overall biographical struc-turing of Hülya’s life history by lumping together the narrative units of Hülya’snarrative. I use the supra-segmental sequential organization of Hülya’s overallautobiographical narrative as a guide. But this is only possible on the base of ameticulous segmentation of the entire text into local narrative units or it wouldbe impossible to differentiate between segmental und supra-segmental units. Inaddition, it would be impossible to appreciate the vague or even “oblique”ways of textual rendering of disorderly and hurting experiences, which shespecifically expressed through background constructions dealing with her pre-arranged marriage and her divorce.2.1. The family trap (ll.122-154)In the beginning of Hülya’s life history there is her family’s collective trajec-tory of being unable to autonomously support itself. Hülya’s parents do nothave the capacity to give a proper education to three of five children, still de-1 These include narrative units, sub-segmental phenomena (like background constructionsand descriptive detailing) and supra-segmental meta-units of sequential biographical con-texts dealing with biographical process structures (like biographical action schemes, bio-graphical trajectories of suffering, biographical processes of identity metamorphosis and thepursuit of institutional expectation patterns of the life course).110pendent on their support. Hülya’s father became severely ill, fell into unem-ployment, and has not worked since. He was not able to uphold his own house-hold, because he did not have health or invalidity insurance. Instead, the oldestson took over, and he now controls the household budget covering all depend-ant family members (including his father and mother). This might be a typicalintergenerational relationship in a rural society with patrilocal succession(which goes back to ancient times). The oldest daughter is an exception to thedifficult situation in which other family members live: she married a well-to-dofarmer. Hülya’s family including herself took the opportunity to work on thefarm of the rich son in law during the summer season of harvest.The absence of the household autonomy of Hülya’s inner family means hu-miliation for her father, mother, the bright youngest brother (who cannot go touniversity), and herself. Hülya cannot get a vocational training, although shehas been successful in school. And nobody seems to be concerned about it—contrary to the concern about the educational situation of her youngest brother.Hülya is apparently expected to become a traditional housewife. (Later welearn that Hülya’s father might possibly have had different ideas, but he hadbeen removed from his former authority position as head of the family—ll.1074-1077.) In the early days of her life Hülya identifies intensely with hermother, who cannot reign her own household and, hence, is unable to functionproperly as a traditional housewife and mother. She suffers a lot and seems tobe emotionally quite unstable. Hülya doesn’t see any future perspective for hermother, for her father, for her brother and for herself. She witnesses the mal-functioning or even deterioration of the traditional rural family system in Tur-key. It does not fit the modern requirements for the development of autono-mous, individualized biographical identities which Hülya is oriented to; herfather’s advice probably plays an important role in this context. Taking intoaccount the absence of a protecting health and unemployment insurance sys-tem, one realises that no welfare state or civil society serves as a substitute forthe lack of protection and social solidarity meant to derive from the traditionalTurkish rural family system. This explains Hülya’s subsequent high apprecia-tion for the German system of social security produced and permanently upheldby state and cooperative institutions.2.2. Hülya’s biographical action scheme of work migration andof supporting her family through it (ll.156-195)Hülya develops the plan not only to escape from the family trajectory of heter-onomous determination, of being dependent on the (probably not freely given)support of her very controlling oldest brother, of the humiliation of her parentsand herself and of not having any developmental personal future for the familymembers and herself, but also to rescue her family from its predicament. Hav-ing seen Turkish guest workers in the neighbourhood coming back from West-111ern Germany during vacation times, who seem to be affluent in their life style(ll.145-146), Hülya at first fantasizes about and then plans to embark on alabour migration to West Germany as soon as possible. Her fantasies can inpart be ascribed to having been misled by the show-off displayed by migrantworkers having come home; here we therefore have the opportunity to studythe power of “pull” mechanisms of labour migration.There are two features of Hülya’s action plan to go to West Germany as aguest worker, which seem to be special. First, Hülya is the youngest child ofthe family and it can legitimately be asked, why is she the only member of theinner family who develops and pursues the plan to rescue the family throughlabour migration? Being very young and female she seems to be the least fitfamily member for this type of rescue action—to be accomplished through hardcorporeal work, which is associated with cultural alienation and social isola-tion. Second, although Hülya painstakingly attempts to give the impression thather family—especially her father and her mother—does not like to send herabroad, it is her father, who finally assists in the legal procedure of “making heryounger” to the effect that she can apply in advance to the administrative guestworker program. One of her brothers—probably the eldest brother as head ofthe family—accompanies her to Istanbul, the location of the selection processin the administrative recruitment procedure for getting promising (healthy,bright, well educated, hard working) guest workers. He obviously is not onlyher protector and emotional supporter, but also controls her pursuit of labourmigration. For example, he harshly criticizes her when she reacts with panic atthe long needles used for drawing blood for the compulsory blood tests.One gets the impression that it is not just Hülya, who pushes through herbiographical action scheme, but also that the family is indeed quite suppor-tive—perhaps even pushy—regarding her pursuit and realisation of the plan.Though being the youngest child, she appears to be the least embedded andleast rooted within the family structure and social structure of rural Turkey; shetherefore is the one most “available” for uprooting and migration to Germany(from where she serves as the supporter of the family from afar). In addition, asthe youngest child she can least be helped in getting a good education and aproper vocational training at a time when the material position of the familycontinuously deteriorates.2.3. The intake procedure for guest workers that Hülya isencountering (ll.197-258)Hülya undergoes the institutional procedure of being tested, examined andselected for “guest work” in Germany. This procedure resembles the intakeprocedure of being drafted into, or incorporated within, an army—especiallytaking into account the medical examinations and mental ability tests adminis-tered to the applicants. But it also shows some additional features of checking112and scrutinizing that are harsher than any army intake procedure: scrutinyresembling that given a horse or slave to be sold. In addition, a phase for thepresentation of the work to be done in Germany and for the signing of thecontract is built into the institutional selection procedure for guest workers, forexample, for activities of advertising and of formal contract reciprocity.The selection and contract procedures are formally controlled by the na-tional Turkish work administration agency. But they seem to be more effec-tively moulded by the interests and interventions of German firms that plan tohire Turkish personnel. Two facts reveal the low efficacy of official Turkishcontrol during the intake procedure and later on (when Hülya has worked inGermany for some time). First, Hülya had just turned seventeen when sheunderwent the selection and intake procedure and her age is not checked care-fully. Second, the Turkish labour administration agent visiting Hülya’s firm(ll.390-409) does not—unlike Gogol’s “auditor”—seem to do autonomouschecks of the circumstances under which the Turkish labourers work and live.He obviously does not check if somebody of the Turkish work personnel isactually missing—in this case Hülya, who is severely ill at the time (due to anaccident at work) and has been hidden from his eyes by being placed in a wait-ing room for a whole day with the false announcement that she was seeing thephysician.Generally speaking, a systematic collusion between the public Turkish la-bour agency and exploitative German firms apparently had been established tothe disadvantage and detriment of the selected and hired guest workers.2.4. The biographical trajectory of compulsory labour(ll.260-409)During her first year in Germany, Hülya is trapped within the dynamics of aprisoner’s or slave worker’s trajectory of confinement and forced labour. WhenHülya arrives at Germany, she experiences not only the normal type of immi-gration trajectory (RIEMANN & SCHÜTZE 1991) but also the much harsherones of confinement and compulsory labour.In Hülya’s case, the normal type of an immigrant’s trajectory means that fora certain while she would not be able to proceed under the auspices of herbiographical action scheme of labour migration—earning surplus money insupport of her family back home in Turkey. Or more generally speaking, in thecourse of a normal immigration trajectory expectation patterns—following upthe action scheme of establishing oneself within the new life situation in acircumspect way, earning “real money”, and improving by this one’s ownmaterial life situation—are impaired or even eliminated for a while. This is so,since everything within the new life situation turns out to be different from howit had been expected prior to the journey and immigration. The experience ofbeing culturally and socially strange to the new life situation, that is, of having113to live and proceed under conditions that are unknown, would for a whileoverwhelm and impair the immigrant’s capacity to follow up her or his ownline of intentions and orientations by circumspect action. For a while, the im-migrant would only be able to react to the overpowering conditions of thestrange, very urging new life predicament. For example, she or he would beforced to follow up the conditional relevancies of the new situation with itsunexpected necessities. At the same time the immigrant would also be isolatedsocially. Especially due to the language barrier, she or he would not be able tocommunicate with others and would feel alone. In addition, she or he would bedisoriented by the falsification of her or his own cultural and social expectationpatterns brought into the new cultural and social situation (SCHÜTZ 1964a).The immigrant would feel self-alienated by her or his incapacity to follow upformer intentions.Then, in the course of the normal type of immigration trajectory, the immi-grant would need some time to learn the ropes of the new social and culturalsituation—acquiring the language, managing to get in contact with others,communicating with them, and understanding the regulations, conditions andaction possibilities of the new life and labour situation. All of this would bequite difficult initially. But after some time, the immigrant would be able to re-cover her or his own action capacities for following up the old overall actionscheme of earning surplus money and to improve her situation. For example,Hülya could really start to support her family in Turkey, and in addition to thisshe could develop a new biographical action scheme (e.g., to establish her ownautonomous existence in Germany). Of course, to a certain extent, she wouldremain a cultural stranger. She still would compare her old cultural expecta-tions with the new cultural orientations that she has learned in between(SCHÜTZ 1964a, 1964b). But as such an “enculturated” stranger she surelywould be able to act autonomously again. In addition, as a cultural hybrid(BHABHA 1994) she increasingly would envision certain opportunities fororientation, reflection, deliberation and action that are not open to autochtho-nous members of the immigrant receiving German society. On the other hand,she would still suffer from being positioned between the two cultures and so-cietal bodies as a marginal personality (STONEQUIST 1961).As mentioned above, Hülya’s new predicament of confinement and compul-sory labour is more severe than the normal type of life situation of an immi-grant. She gets deprived of her passport by having it stored in the administra-tion bureau of the recruitment firm, and she does not receive a permit ofresidence for the whole time span of her work in the firm; her permit of resi-dence does not include the five days of extra work which are required from herafter the expiry of her contract and she is not aware of the specific legal re-quirements, she only learns about them later on. The firm does not explain tothe newly recruited foreign workers what their civil liberties and work rightsare, and nobody else—for example, the Turkish labour administration or Ger-114man institutions such as the German labour administration, German unions,controlling public bodies (e.g., the Gewerbeaufsichtsämter) or representativesof the German employer organisations (like the Industrie- und Handelskam-mer)—does this either. Hülya insinuates—and she seems to be correctly as-suming—that the firm deliberately takes advantages of the ignorance of thenewly recruited workers, since after the year of official contract nobody likes tostay in the firm, and, instead of this, the firm recruits new personnel in Turkeythat too is exploited and systematically deprived of its work rights and civilliberties. The firm does not proceed legally, but it is remarkable that it canenact these practices in such a systematic and effective manner. Striking struc-tural similarities exist to slave labour in Nazi firms and concentration camps2or—maybe this comes closer—to prostitution into which unsuspecting youngwomen from Eastern Europe have been trapped who are lured and often “im-ported” to Western Europe.Hülya has to live in a small room with four others young women in somesort of army barracks situation. She has to work from six o’clock in the morn-ing to ten o’clock at night: in addition to her normal work at the chickenslaughter house assembly line, she cleans the workplace together with threeother women without receiving any substantial payment. The safety regulationsin the factory are poorly enforced. Hülya gets injured twice, and her medicalpredicament is exacerbated by the negligence of the factory physician. In both2 It might be seen as an exaggeration to state structural similarities between compulsorylabour in a concentration camp and Hülya’s overload of work in the slaughterhouse forchicken. One could argue, that Hülya always had the legal right to quit her work contractand to work somewhere else or—at least—to return to Turkey without a proper annulmentof the contract. And in fact, by physical force nobody endangered Hülya’s life at all.—Buton the other hand, decisive is the fact, that Hülya did not know about such alternatives. Shemistakenly assumed that she was forced to remain in her work position in the slaughter-house for chicken and, in addition, that she had to carry her overwhelming burden of work.The management of the slaughterhouse systematically reckoned with the ignorance of thenewly recruited workers and was, thus, able to organize a hermetically closed system ofexploitation of its neophytes. In addition, there seemed to be at least some bit of vague col-lusion of German state institutions, public agencies and professional bodies with the man-agement of the slaughterhouse: the union, the agency for factory safety and health control,the governmental job centre, the chamber of industry and commerce, the local medical doc-tors and local hospitals tended to look away, to circumvent the ominous establishment, tokeep quiet and to leave the inmates in all their ignorance about their work rights, healthrights and human rights in general. Although this collusion of German official institutions,bodies and professional actors was vague, it was—in fact, on a quite systematic scale—morally irresponsible nevertheless. (In this regard Hülya is especially critical about the lo-cal union; see ll.421-422.) Hülya was not forced through physical violence to do all the ex-tra work—and at least formally she probably even got some extra pay for it, although itwas, then, factually reduced from her regular pay again. But she was systematically ma-nipulated to mistakenly assume that there was no alternative from doing that extra work. Inexactly this sense she was forced to do the extra work; and in this sense, too, the manage-ment of the slaughterhouse had successfully set up a modern organisational arrangement forcompulsory work: it accomplished it through a cunning strategy of making use of the igno-rance of its dependants from foreign countries.115cases of accident Hülya does not receive proper treatment and is forced by thefactory physician or the shop steward to work until late at the night. The man-agement of the firm knows that the treatment by the factory physician is inade-quate: it would not have hidden the injured and ailing Hülya from the eyes ofthe Turkish labour administration inspector.Hülya assumes to be forced to stay in the slaughterhouse for the first year inGermany. She does not have her passport. She is in debt to the firm, since itissued her an advance payment to her at the beginning of the contract. Hülyathinks that there is no legal escape from the contract and that it is totally impos-sible to change from one firm to the other during the first year, the contractyear, as guest worker in Germany. (The slaughterhouse officials do not correctthis assumption when they refuse a slightly premature ending of the one-yearcontract.) It is a nightmare for Hülya to imagine the “worst case scenario”:being forced to go home without ending the contract and returning to Turkey asa failure. (The company probably knows that its Turkish employees do not seea feasible escape from the situation by returning home to Turkey. Pride, selfesteem, reputation and the moral state of being righteous would be overwhelm-ingly at stake.)The compulsory work situation has three features of biographical impact.First, it isolates the persons in the same predicament from each other. At thebeginning of Hülya’s stay there is no solidarity of mutual help and consolationbetween the newcomers and the other dormitory dwellers and co-workers.Second, it is a life and work situation of extreme humiliation: Hülya knowsabout her exploitation—too much and too hard work and far too little pay—butshe cannot change it. Her central biographical problem is to be forced into asituation that is unjust and unfair. Moreover, her situation makes little sensewith respect to her former biographical action scheme of supporting her familyin Turkey. She realises that her suffering is not only an everyday burden, butalso does not matter in terms of future biographical developments and perspec-tives. Hülya feels and fears to be seen as a grumbler after she has been injuredby the two work accidents and complaining about them and the pain involved.Her me-images (MEAD 1934) are impaired. She would like to be seen as ahard efficient worker and she feels to be approached like a malingerer. Third,Hülya is forced to postpone learning German and being socialized into Germanculture, because there is no chance of having private social contacts with Ger-mans (even buying groceries is difficult, since she has to work from 6 to 22o’clock). There is no time and little energy left to attend any type of languagelessons. (It is remarkable that neither the employer nor the labour administra-tion or the union provide related opportunities or support.) In addition, theremight be an emotional barrier to learn the language and culture of a society inwhich such a despicable systematic work situation of unfairness, loss of bio-graphical sense, and personal humiliation is possible. It is remarkable thatHülya learns German and gets into German culture only eight years later, when116she seriously considers building a life in Germany rather than in Turkey andafter going through a pre-arranged marriage and her divorce. The delay oflearning German and getting involved in German culture might be due not onlyto a lack of opportunity but also to a systematic attitude acquired in this earlyoccupational “hell” of enforced, exploiting and isolating work. This means thatwork arrangements do not always have a socializing impact on acquiring thecompetence to do collective identity work (dealing with the neighbourhood,with networks of acquaintances, friends and voluntary associations, with thecultural region, with Germany and Turkey as nation states and their productiverelationship to each other, with civil society and the welfare state, with publicdiscourse arenas, with Europe and the universal world society as frames ofmoral and political orientation). The contrary can also be true. If work situa-tions are experienced as disastrous, they can retard the biographical develop-ment of competencies for collective identity work (including learning pertinentlanguages).2.5. Liberation from the compulsory labour trajectory(ll.411-475)Nearly at the end of her first year of contract work, Hülya is visited by remoterelatives living in Hamburg, who have been asked by her own inner family tolook after Hülya. In this concern of her own inner family, especially her par-ents, might be implied their consideration of how Hülya would be able to findanother job at all, since an extension of her first job contract seems to be un-bearable for her and should be avoided by all means. (However, Hülya does notconsider this question as the implied intention of her inner family in turning forhelp to their remote relatives in Hamburg.) The remote relatives from Hamburgimmediately realise how deplorable and despicable Hülya’s present work situa-tion really is. They attempt to immediately take her with them. But the factorymanagement insists that Hülya would have to fulfil her contract up to the lastday; it even requires Hülya to work five days longer than that stipulated in thecontract, since her actual employment after coming to Germany started onlyfive days after her arrival at the factory location. These five days are actuallyquite important in legal terms, because for them Hülya and her roommatesdon’t have a permit of residence, since the one year permit expired five daysearlier. By accident the brother of one of the roommates realises the lack of avalid permit of residence for the five young women, including Hülya, when heattempts to take his own sister with him to his place of residence. (Not having avalid permit of residence at one’s disposal would mean the danger of beingextradited immediately when checked by the police by chance or when gettinginto contact with the governmental work administration or with other possibleemployers.) The circumspect brother of Hülya’s roommate can manage to get ahearing for the five young women with an understanding and professional117agent of the governmental work administration in a neighbouring city. This isthe first German state representative mentioned by Hülya who fulfils his civilservant duty by professionally criticising and controlling the dehumanisingwork exploitation practices that are illegally imposed on guest workers. Hechecks the legal status of the five young women for their entitlement to work intheir former firm of employment and the lack of correct administrative prac-tices of its management to deal with that legal entitlement and the occupationaland civil rights implied in it in a direct phone communication with the firmmanagement. He criticises the disgusting administrative and legal performanceof the firm management right away and outspokenly. And then, without anybureaucratic delay, he issues the permits of residence to the five young women.In the course of her liberation from the former compulsory work situation,Hülya also becomes aware of the social base of sisterly solidarity and mutuallove between her and the other four roommates who now have to part fromeach other. Only now, in retrospect, she can understand and appreciate themutual emotional support and practical help of her and her roommates for eachother as an important experience in her life. Only now she realises the value offriendships apart from the family. This is in contrast to the solidarity platformof the traditional Turkish family, which step by step deteriorates under theimpact of societal modernization, or at least does not produce biographical wel-fare to its individual members. This realisation of the value of private friend-ship is an important early step of biographical work that Hülya, in the follow-ing years, will do so impressively. Hülya now notices that a network of privatefriends is extremely important in a situation of isolated life as a migrant workerseparated from her own family of origin. Hülya starts to understand—and lateron she realises even more closely (see, e.g., the coda part of Hülya’s autobio-graphical narrative of the main story part of the interview on ll.857-861)—thatin the future the networks of private, individualised friendship might become anew platform of social solidarity in life situations of social isolation and indi-vidualisation. This new solidarity platform might substitute for a malfunction-ing or even deteriorated platform of solidarity provided by the traditional ruralfamily in Turkey. (In her biographical insight, Hülya’s deliberation resemblesthe analytical assessments of the early Chicago sociologist of the impact ofrapid modernisation, especially industrialisation and metropolisation, on thebiography constructions, social relationships and solidarity bases of modernmen and women, especially on work migrants and immigrants with their “mar-ginal personalities” [THOMAS & ZNANIECKI 1927, PARK 1967, STONE-QUIST 1961]).With the help of her remote relatives from Hamburg Hülya gets a work posi-tion in a metal processing firm in a small town near Hamburg. This might notbe the work she would have liked most. (First, the remote relatives tried to gether into a big hospital as a nurse assistant or cleaning woman, but she was notaccepted.) But looking at her formulations in the text of her autobiographical118rendering (e.g., ll.819-823) it becomes clear that Hülya develops a biographicalidentification with hard industrial work she would like to do with circumspec-tion, effectiveness, trustworthiness, dependability and biographical pride—verymuch similar to the value features Max WEBER (1988) has conceptually con-nected to the orientation pattern and cultural tradition of the protestant workethic. Probably Hülya does not like to be conditioned by a network of socialrelationships that may be difficult to handle in her own family of origin. In-stead, the industrial work situation can be handled without much complicatedcommunication and negotiation.Having been rescued from the life and work situation of compulsory work,Hülya intensely expects from the future to find situations that she can shapeherself and that allow her to have some biographical rest to start learning to livein Germany. Not to find such a new life situation would be extremely disap-pointing to her. After a first step of biographical work she seems to be ready fora biographical metamorphosis (SCHÜTZE, 1991, 1994) of education, learning,acquiring new cultural orientations, i.e. she yearns to leave behind the depres-sive predicament of a self-alienating trajectory experience, of being the igno-rant cultural stranger and of being forced into a exploitative compulsory worktrajectory.2.6. Intensification of the biographical experience of suffering ina self alienating trajectory of work exploitation (ll.480-544)Contrary to her own biographical expectation, the trajectory experience ofextreme work exploitation does not vanish when Hülya enters the metal pack-aging and metal processing firm. This amounts to a very complicated bio-graphical problem constellation, since Hülya has allowed herself to open up tonew hope because she could finally manage to escape from the forceful trap ofcompulsory extra labour in the slaughterhouse for chicken. Now, in contrast tothe experience of this extraordinary form of exploitation, Hülya must encounterthe “normal type” of a biographical trajectory of occupational exploitation ofmigrant workers in Germany. She has to do hard bodily work and gets a typicaldisease from it: tendovaginitis and the swelling of her operating arm, throughwhich she pursues her industrial work tasks. (She has to continually push heavylevers for closing the lids of tin cans.) After two years of this extremely strenu-ous work she has to change her work place in order to avoid having her workdisease become chronic and to escape from this mechanism of corporeal trans-formation of her entrapment predicament of exploitation trajectory. But—astypical for the fateful mechanisms of a full-blown trajectory dynamics—shefalls out of the frying pan into the fire, i.e. she has now to lift roughly 800cardboards a day onto pallets. The total exhaustion of her body partially condi-tioned by this causes Hülya to become dangerously underweight, although amental state of depression is also part of the structural conditions for her weight119loss. The latter of course is a second phenomenon of corporeal transformationof the work exploitation trajectory and of the biographical experiences of se-vere suffering connected to it.The private accommodation situation of Hülya is difficult, too. She has tolive with three other persons in a small room and at least one or two of theseother persons are on different shifts. In addition, all of these other persons seemto be much older than Hülya. She always must keep quiet if she is present inthe room. Only later she can live with other young women, albeit they are fromcountries other than Turkey, and since she is still not able to speak German,that means that there cannot develop such warm feelings of mutual sisterlysupport and solidarity, which she had experienced being with her young Turk-ish roommates in her first place of residence when she worked in the slaughter-house. The life situation of Hülya is sharply exacerbated by the future projec-tion of her own life and personal development looking at the example of theolder roommates of her accommodation room and of the other older Turkishguest workers in her new firm. Looking at the psychosocial features of thesepersons she envisions a “natural history” of deterioration of the personal identi-ties of those guest workers getting older in Germany who are totally isolated,do not allow themselves to conduct their own private lives and therefore arejust work and salary oriented. In Hülya’s view, these old and worn out guestworkers became personally isolated exactly by losing the social ties of familyand friendship networks in their country of origin. In addition, from the pointof view of Hülya, their ability to relate to interaction partners in Germany withfeelings of solidarity, sympathy and understanding permanently deteriorated,too, because they did not understand that a substitution of the lost family tiesby other social relationships (e.g., of getting married in Turkey or Germany, ofengaging oneself in Turkish and/or German voluntary associations, of findingTurkish or German friends) would be pivotal. In Hülya’s view, it seems to bethat they necessarily became selfish, de-cultured and extremely materialistic. Itis the perspective of Hülya that today, at the end of this process of “naturalhistory”, the old and isolated migrant workers envision themselves and theirwork partners just as good or bad machine operators, i.e. as just biotic, corpo-real parts of the machine system, according to the rhythm of industrial work.One has to take into account that here Hülya is using a common Turkishcontrast set of categorisation regarding life in rural Turkey (with all its expecta-tion features of idyllic landscape, of freely given and trustworthy solidarity andemotional relating to each other), on the one hand, and regarding the life underthe condition of industrial work (e.g., cf. MAURENBRECHER, 1985), on theother. But she doesn’t assume that this difference is just imposed by the clashof the mental forces of two different cultures, but that it is caused by the overalllife course and life situation of the isolated and exploited migrant worker,which conditions the deterioration of their personal identities and culturedness.Hülya overcomes the common German image that almost every migrant wor-120ker—especially those from Turkey—comes in “family packs” to Germany. Shedraws the attention to the very fact that many migrant workers—and that is astructural feature of the life of one important category of them—are utterlyalone in their German life situation and become even more isolated during theirtime of permanent stay in Germany (because they are stigmatised, confined totheir own living quarters and self-restrained since they are not willing to investin social relationships to home-national, other-national and German partners inGermany having in their mind the plan to return to their country of origin any-way). Hülya has—as stated already—a “Chicago Sociology” type of perspec-tive on work migration to Germany, being progressively forced into structuralprocesses of social isolation and individualisation (THOMAS & ZNANIECKI1927, PARK & MILLER 1921, ZORBAUGH 1929).One of the riddles of the autobiographical narrative interview with Hülya isthe fact that she marks the biographical suffering related to her second workposition as even more intense than the biographical suffering in the slaughter-house for chicken. Comparing the work organisations of the two positions thesecond one does not have the characteristic features of the compulsory worksituation as the first one has. One can find compulsory work situations in pris-ons, in institutions of enforced prostitution and slave trade with women andchildren as well as in concentration camps. All these institutions exert an ex-tremely dangerous impact on bodily existence and biographical identity. It isremarkable, that Hülya herself reveals that she was always reminded by theoutfit of the mass shower room of the dormitory connected with the slaughter-house for chicken—it was actually an old school building—to the gas cham-bers of concentration camps (l.455). But nevertheless, the biographical suffer-ing in the second work position and in the accompanying accommodationsituation seems to be even worse. Hülya marks the working-through of thissuffering as one of the important “switch stations” of her managing her migrantworker trajectory. She delineates that experience and the biographical sufferingconnected to it as a “hard blow” for her (l.512); she cries all the time (l.518),and the janitor admonishes her that her permanent crying would finally kill her(ll.527-528).There are three reasons for the utter bleakness of Hülya’s second work tra-jectory experience: First, Hülya had hoped to escape from the trajectory trap ofexploitative and alienating work when leaving the slaughterhouse for chicken.Understandably, she had assumed that her first work situation in Germanywould be extraordinary through its open illegality and coercion. Now she has torealise that even under correct legal conditions the dynamics of the trajectory ofexploitative and alienating work, in which migrant workers in Germany can beentrapped, goes on and on. She also has to acknowledge, that this trajectorydynamics and its organisational structural context are an overwhelmingly wellorganised system, and that her chances for escaping them are small. Second, inher second work position and the housing connected to it Hülya feels even121more isolated than in her first work and dwelling situation, since she lost heryoung solidarity group of sisterly Turkish roommates. Third—and this is themost important reason—Hülya envisions, looking at her future life course, howher own biographical identity could develop, when she would permanentlyremain as an isolated migrant worker in Germany. She looks into the mirrorimage of older women who underwent the isolated migrant worker trajectoryfor extended periods of their lives. She realises the mechanisms of becomingalienated from one’s own identity connected with that isolated migrant workertrajectory. Of course, she stresses in her argumentative commentary (ll.515-522) that she is different in terms of her essential features of identity “lay-out”as inherited from her family and home culture. But when she explains that sheis “still sentimental, sensible today” she insinuates that she has already gottenhardened, too (l.519). It is a nightmare for her to imagine, that she could be-come just a working machine and—connected to it—could get utterly selfishand materialistic like the older women with whom she lives. She realises thedanger of losing her own biographical identity by a systematic process of self-alienation connected to the isolated migrant worker trajectory. Now she knowsthat she has to make a serious attempt to change her life situation drastically.This is her next step of biographical work: to analyse the isolated migrantworker’s trajectory and to decide to hinder such a gloomy development bysearching for a way out.2.7. Hülya’s pre-arranged marriage as an unsuccessful attempt toescape from the isolated migrant worker’s trajectory (ll.546-573,671-731)Not earlier than almost two years after her coming to Germany Hülya is able togo on a vacation to Turkey. Only then her mother fully realises how much herdaughter has suffered: she is only a shadow of herself, having lost 40 pounds.And Hülya, in turn, realises how much her mother, too, has suffered from herbeing abroad: she became severely ill immediately after Hülya’s leaving forGermany. During her stay at home mother and daughter—perhaps the wholefamily—must have understood that Hülya would not have a realistic chance tobecome affluent in Germany and that her worker’s existence in Germany mightbe connected to too much suffering. And note again, that immediately before,while still in Germany, Hülya had detected for herself the danger of becomingestranged from herself by permanently remaining entrapped in the isolatedmigrant worker’s trajectory in the future. The double insight of Hülya, on theone hand, and of her family on the other, and the communicative exchangeabout it between Hülya and her family, especially between Hülya and hermother, must have been followed by thinking about a marriage for Hülya dur-ing this first stay at home, although she doesn’t report it.122During her next visit to Turkey, two years later (in 1976), Hülya gets mar-ried to a relative belonging to the maternal part of her own extended family.Hülya explains that she did not love her cousin (“...well, that was...no...marriage with great love”—ll.556). And at the same time she conveystwo other tacit considerations that don’t really fit well with each other: thatthere was no alternative marriage candidate available and that she generallywas not in the mood to get married at all (“..., but I didn’t love anybody somuch either or something.”—ll.556-557), since she was still exhausted andsuffering from her trajectory experience of an isolated migrant worker who didnot find the time even to think about young men. And in addition, such a tradi-tional pre-arranged marriage was not developmentally adequate for her any-more, having already started to do the biographical work of one’s own lifehistorical personalisation and individualisation. The young couple remainedtogether only for one week (ll.697). Hülya gets a first impression even at thewedding ceremony that her husband would not be the right partner for her:“Well, we didn’t quarrel and so on, but I had...right at the...we...” (ll.696-697).“But I knew this /eh/ right a way /eh/ that we didn’t harmonise. That itwouldn’t end well, even if I would return home forever” (ll.706-708). Andduring the one week of living together Hülya realises the difference between arelative who is a nice, morally proper man and a husband to be loved: “Well,you just expect something different from relatives and /eh/ something differentfrom your husband and ...He was .../eh/ not like I had ...imagined.” (ll.699-700)It becomes clear from Hülya’s way of storytelling that her return to Turkeyin order to get married was originally meant to stay in Turkey and live with herhusband there (ll.546-547). This assumption about her original plan is in totalaccordance with her biographical insight into the migrant worker’s trajectory ofexhausting exploitation, of getting culturally alienated and of losing one’s ownpersonal identity—an insight, she could win by looking into the mirror imageof the older women living with Hülya in the same dormitory connected to hersecond job. Hülya envisions her marriage as a biographical action scheme ofescaping from the exploitation and self-alienation trajectory of the isolatedmigrant worker.But due to her experiences on the marriage day and in the following week ofliving together, Hülya develops the action plan of returning to Germany for oneyear; two years are not allowed by the parents by law and by her own mother.Hülya gives as the official explanation for her action plan of returning to Ger-many that she would like to earn the money for and buy electrical householdequipment and other household goods in order to let her future children learnabout the former migrant worker’s life of their mother (ll.565-570). Both rea-sons given are not false; to the contrary, they are biographically plausible, andthey underline the life historical and individualized attitude of Hülya to herown life. But on the other hand, these two reasons, why Hülya should return toGermany again, disguise and rationalise Hülya’s new distance towards her123legal marriage partner. The change of her mind—first she plans to stay in Tur-key with her husband and not to return to Germany, and then she develops theaction plan to return to Germany to earn additional money in order to buyhousehold equipment—is only understandable by assuming that she has secondthoughts about her marriage and wants to stay apart from it for a while in orderto reconsider it.After her return to Germany Hülya becomes severely ill for a year, andwhen she comes home again to Turkey one year later, she is still so weak thatin the beginning of her time there she can only stay with her mother. Not earlierthan during her last week in Turkey she finally visits her husband, who livesquite far from Hülya’s parents. Hülya’s in-laws feel insulted by her late visit toher husband, and he himself blames her for not having visited him immediatelyafter her arrival in Turkey and for not returning from Germany even earlier.Hülya is very disappointed that he does not ask her about her health situationand her suffering at all. Such a deeply felt attitude of compassion would havebeen the only road for rapprochement and transgressing the conventional ex-pectation patterns of traditional gender relating and family life. But it is obvi-ous that Hülya’s husband is trapped into the mold of traditional male conduct.Hülya returns to Germany again not keeping the promise to stay with herhusband. After some argumentative letter exchanges during the following yearshe decides to get a divorce from him since she acknowledges that he as a verytraditional man with his conventional ideas about male pride is totally unfit toserve as an understanding husband of an individualised young woman havinglived alone for a long time. Hülya follows up her action scheme of getting thedivorce, although her in-laws and even her own mother implore her to stay inthe marriage. Through her autonomous action scheme of getting the divorceHülya emancipates herself from traditional rural Turkish family culture with allits responsibilities and expectations. She pursues this against the deep wishes ofher own mother. The dissent and emotional cleavage between mother anddaughter must have been very difficult for Hülya since she loves her mother sodearly, and she always kept a close emotional bond with her. But here, on theother hand, she has to notice and to accept a dramatic difference of the outlookon life between mother and daughter.124References<ref>Bhabha, Homi K. (1994).
