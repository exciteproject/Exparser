This demand for CAQDAS has brought not only moresophistication in the newest programs and updates but also the discussion about its methodologicalimplications and the need for more training courses and workshops. A lot has been written aboutthe relation between CAQDAS and qualitative methodology. Nevertheless, the ways the trainingcourses and workshops have been developed and carried out have not been outlined. Who arethese courses planned for? Is there any prerequisite that the attendants must fulfil? What must themain goal of these training courses be? This article discusses some facts I have found in myexperience as a social researcher and CAQDAS user and trainer in a country where this kind ofsoftware is not widespread. The article also focuses on some of the problems that arise when train-ing people in the use of CAQDAS and the consequences the globalisation of training courses andworkshops focused on the acquisition of mechanical code-and-retrieve skills have for qualitativemethodology. Finally, I propose some critical issues that CAQDAS trainers and qualitativeresearchers should bear in mind when teaching or learning the use of any qualitative data analysissoftware.Table of Contents1.

Critical Issues When Teaching and Learning CAQDASComputers make good friends. No matterhow stupid, dull or dumb we may feel, we canstill feel smarter than our computer.Computers can do many things, but theycannot think—and we can. Unfortunately,that also means the thinking is up to us. Acomputer can help us to analyse our data,but it cannot analyse our data. This is not apedantic distinction: we must do the analysis.Ian DEY, 19931. IntroductionComputer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software, CAQDAS, are verycommon among qualitative researchers nowadays. The first programmes werecreated in the 60s, but it was in the 80s and early 90s when they began to bewidely recognised in the field of qualitative analysis. Today the use of software toassist qualitative analysts is a must, and there is a wide range of programmes tochoose from, each one including specific tools for the handling and storage ofdifferent qualitative data. Some of them can work only with text, others canhandle images, sound and video; some build hierarchical trees of categories,others let the researcher build their own "trees", and others simply list thecategories alphabetically. Most of them can create reports according to theanalyst's needs; some can be used as a first step in the analysis of data, and theresults can be exported to other programmes for further analysis. Although thetools the programmes offer have revolutionised the way of doing qualitativeanalysis, there are still qualitative researchers who systematise their datamanually in a reliable way. [1]Together with the increase of the use of these programmes, many workshops totrain researchers in the use of them have been developed. Some workshops areled by universities and research centres, and others are provided by privateenterprises. Some are offered to small groups of researchers, others are offeredto anyone who wants to learn to use these programmes. But most of them areone-day or two-day training workshops, which guarantee participants that theywill acquire the adequate skills to use a specific software in their own qualitativeprojects. [2]The most well known programmes are the code-based theory-builders (MILES &WIETZMAN, 1995), and most of the workshops offer training in the use of one ofthese programmes. I have trained some qualitative researchers interested inknowing CAQDAS, and some quantitative researchers who simply wanted toknow the way a text analysis software works, but kept on using SPSS. Althoughsoftware to assist qualitative data analysis is almost unknown in Colombia (orperhaps because of it), my brief experience as CAQDAS user and trainer hasmade me wonder: Are we on the right track offering one-day or two-day trainingworkshops? And, even more important, are we on the right track when separating© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(2), Art. 14, Diógenes Carvajal:The Artisan's Tools. Critical Issues When Teaching and Learning CAQDASthe workshops from the academic discussion about the methodologicalimplications that the use of CAQDAS brings? I do not have all the possibleanswers to these questions, but my particular experience shows some ways tore-think most of the current training workshops. [3]2. Training Workshops: Between Neophilia and Usefulness2.1 The demand for training workshopsThe use of CAQDAS is rapidly growing among qualitative researchers. This hasimplied the creation of many workshops round the world to train people in the useof the software. Some programme developers travel widely to lead one-day ortwo-day workshops, which are now highly appreciated in many countries, such asthe United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. These workshops are opento anyone who wants to be trained in the use of a programme; being a qualitativeresearcher is no prerequisite. [4]The demand for workshops is focused on two programmes: Atlas.ti and NUD.IST.I think that this is due to two main reasons: (1) these are the most well knownprogrammes world-wide; and (2) most of the novice qualitative researchers whowant to use a CAQDAS ask more experienced researchers for the "best"programme, and most of the time they are referred to Atlas.ti and NUD.IST. [5]This phenomenon has been strongly criticised. Not because of the programmesthemselves, but because they are based on the Grounded Theory Methodology.COFFEY, HOLBROOK and ATKINSON (1996) say that the wide spread use ofsoftware developed around Grounded Theory, would lead us to thehomogenisation of all the qualitative analysis processes; i.e. we all would becomegrounded theorists. [6]LONKILA (1995) suggests that the fact is that some aspects of Grounded Theoryhave been overemphasised, especially the process of coding. In other words,some of the qualitative researchers are using Grounded Theory because thesoftware they use is based on this methodology. The advantages anddisadvantages that this may bring have been long discussed (see also LEE &FIELDING, 1996). My own experience has shown me that that is causingprejudicial effects in the qualitative research field, something that I had alreadymentioned in a previous article (CARVAJAL, 2001). But there is another fact tobear in mind: some qualitative researchers use CAQDAS because theseprogrammes are fashionable. [7]I have found that some researchers prefer Atlas.ti or NUD.IST based on aspectslike the user-friendliness and the interface, instead of the fact that theprogrammes are useful to their methodology. Once a qualitative researcher askedme about the "best" programme of all (this is the first question CAQDAS usersask); I told her that there was no "best" programme, but that based on the dataand methodology of her research, I could suggest her one. After some interchangeof emails, she decided to buy NUD.IST Vivo because it was the latest version© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(2), Art. 14, Diógenes Carvajal:The Artisan's Tools. Critical Issues When Teaching and Learning CAQDASavailable in the market, and because its interface was more attractive. It is notthat a programme must not have an attractive interface; but the decision to useone or the other must be made from the basis of the methodology the researcheris going to use. Buying a CAQDAS is like buying a tie: you will look for a tie thatmatches the suit you are going to wear. [8]2.2 What people believe and expect from CAQDASAs I said before, in Colombia the software to assist qualitative analysis is almostunknown; because of this, most of the people I have trained had no previousknowledge about CAQDAS. When I asked what they expected from this software,the answer was very simple: "to use the programme to analyse our data". This isthe first misunderstanding about CAQDAS that trainers must fight. Noprogramme can analyse data. They can help the analyst to organise thedocuments, categorise them and facilitate the processes of searching documentsand categories. But the process of interpreting and building results from thecategories and the relations among them is up to us. We must do the analysis(DEY, 1993). [9]The possibility of reducing the time of analysis by using a programme is also oneof the expectations that novice CAQDAS users have. If we compare the processof computer-assisted analysis to the traditional cut and paste, the amount of timewill be significantly reduced. But the time of analysis depends not only on the factof using a CAQDAS or not, but also on the amount of data that is going to beanalysed, the type of analysis the researcher is going to do and the expertise ofthe researcher in the use of the software. Novice users, especially those whohave no background in qualitative research and methods, must realise thatqualitative analyses imply longer time than quantitative analyses do. Using aCAQDAS is not like inputting data in a spreadsheet and pressing OK to obtainresults. It implies a long process of reading, segmenting and categorising thedata. And, finally, if the researcher wants, he/she can also search among his/herdocuments and categories, formulate hypothesis and test them just beforebuilding his/her conclusions. [10]A last expectation novice users have is related to the results of the research.Novice users are interested in the way the programme can help them to write thefinal report of their research. That is, how the outputs can be integrated into thefinal report. The outputs (results of searches, reports on categories, diagrams,etc.) have different formats, depending on the software used. Most of theprogrammes generate outputs that can be exported as ASCII or ANSI files (text-only documents), and then can be edited using a word processor. No qualitativeprogramme generates outputs that can be directly included as a part of the reportof a research. Once again, it is the researcher who has to write his/herconclusions in the final report. [11]These expectations, understandable in the context of researchers that have noprevious knowledge of CAQDAS, represent a quantitative approach to the use of© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(2), Art. 14, Diógenes Carvajal:The Artisan's Tools. Critical Issues When Teaching and Learning CAQDAScomputers in qualitative analysis. Some researchers expect the programme to anal-yse their data in the same way some quantitative programmes like SPSS do. [12]2.3 Characteristics of current training workshops: more tools thanreflectionThrough the mailing list QUAL-Software, created by the CAQDAS NetworkingProject, I regularly receive information about CAQDAS workshops led byuniversities, the CAQDAS Networking Project itself, and private enterprises. I willrefer here only to the workshops that were planned to be held betweenSeptember 2001 and April 2002. Ironically, I will use a quantitative approach toshow the frequency of the main characteristics of these workshops. [13]There were 44 planned CAQDAS workshops, divided as follows: fourteen onNUD.IST Vivo; nine on Atlas.ti; eight on NUD.IST 5; four on NUD.IST 4, as wellas on Decision Explorer and winMAX, and one on The Ethnograph. 29 out of 44workshops were one-day sessions; 14 were two-day sessions, and one was athree-day session. The last one was a special case because it followed a two-daycourse on Handling Qualitative Data. 43 out of 44 workshops were introductoryones. There was only a one-day workshop for advanced users. All of the 44workshops were hands-on, and in seven of them, participants were invited tobring their own data. Only three workshops specified the maximum number ofparticipants (5, 10 and 20 respectively). [14]In addition to the CAQDAS workshops, there were a few other courses onCAQDAS related topics, such as a two-day course on Computer AssistedQualitative Data Analysis, with practical demonstrations of up to five packagesand hands-on workshops on at least three packages. There was also a two-daycourse on Handling Qualitative Data followed by a three-day workshop on aprogramme, and a five-day retreat on the Focus Group method, which includedthe use of software. [15]Apparently the workshops were open to anyone who was interested in the use ofa programme to assist qualitative analysis. Only 3 out of 44 workshops andcourses required the fulfilment of some prerequisites. It was prerequisite to havea basic understanding of qualitative methodology to attend a workshop onNUD.IST 4. It was prerequisite to be a researcher or postgraduate student, and tohave a basic understanding of qualitative data analysis, to attend an introductoryworkshop on NUD.IST Vivo. And it was prerequisite to be a full-time or part-timeworker on research projects, a social science academic, research officer, orpostgraduate research student to attend a two-day course on Computer AssistedQualitative Data Analysis. [16]This very simple categorisation of the characteristics of current CAQDASworkshops allowed me conclude: (1) most of the workshops are one-daysessions; (2) it is not prerequisite to be a qualitative researcher, nor to haveprevious knowledge of qualitative research and methods to attend a workshop;(3) although all the workshops are hands-on, only few of them allow participants© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(2), Art. 14, Diógenes Carvajal:The Artisan's Tools. Critical Issues When Teaching and Learning CAQDASto work with their own data; and (4) almost all of the workshops are intended totrain participants in the use of the basic tools of a programme, but a few of themintend to show the participants the relation between qualitative methodology andCAQDAS. [17]These workshops could lead to a misleading use of the programmes as tools toassist qualitative analysis and, in consequence, the undertaking of qualitativeresearch projects in which the qualitative methodology has been replaced orimposed by the software. This is not a joke. It can really happen; and what isworse, it happens. [18]2.4 "What is the next step?" When coding rulesNow I would like to talk about my own experience with a specific workshop, whichillustrates the problems that can arise when novice users face CAQDAS. One ofthe first workshops I ran was in the use of NUD.IST 4, and it was directed to agroup of about eight young researchers. They were interested in using aCAQDAS to analyse an enormous amount of field notes they had already made.They wanted a one-day workshop to acquire the basic tools to use NUD.IST 4. [19]After telling them that the programme could not do the analysis for them, I beganby the origins of NUD.IST and told them that although its design was based onGrounded Theory, it could be used with any methodology. At this point, theyinterrupted me and asked me about Grounded Theory, which they did not know.In that moment I stopped and brought up the basics of Grounded Theory, andthen continued the workshop as planned. At the end, I told them to email ortelephone me in the future if they needed further help in the use of NUD.IST. Ishould not have done so. [20]Some days after the workshop they called me because they were not sure abouthow to code. Besides, they wanted more information about the coding processused in Grounded Theory, because they considered that it was the methodologythey were going to use, instead of the one they proposed when they designedtheir research project. Some time later they called me again to tell me what theyhad done up to that time and then asked me: "what is the next step?" I met themand noticed that they had based all their analysis on the process of coding. I triedto make them realise that maybe that was not the way analysis should be done,but they were just focused on the deadline of their research. What kind of finalreport did they write? I do not know. What validity does that research have? I donot know either. [21]This experience exemplifies what COFFEY, HOLBROOK and ATKINSON warnedus in 1996: the homogenisation of all the ways of doing qualitative analysis due tothe use of CAQDAS. Those young researchers believed that because NUD.ISTwas designed based on Grounded Theory, that methodology was the one theyhad to use, because it suited the programme. It also exemplifies one of theconsequences one-day workshops bring: these novice CAQDAS users believedthat the use of a programme was going to strengthen and validate the© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(2), Art. 14, Diógenes Carvajal:The Artisan's Tools. Critical Issues When Teaching and Learning CAQDASconclusions of their research. Instead of this, the use they made of theprogramme invalidates their conclusions because they forced their methodologyto fit the programme's design. They were not critical of the program. They weredazzled by what I call neophilia: a blind trust in what technology brings, taking itfor granted, without discussion. [22]3. Alternatives When Teaching and Learning CAQDASBernardo TURNBULL (2001), referring to his own experience, once said:"running [a CAQDAS] without training was much like sneaking into an artisan'sworkshop and learning about the art and trade by looking at her tools. [...] I have saidmore than once that teaching the use of a software to someone who could not do thejob by hand is dangerous." [23]His experience showed me that I was not alone in this crusade: CAQDASworkshops should not be limited to learning the use of the software's tools. So Iwondered, what else must a CAQDAS workshop include? More than the use ofthe software (anyone who has the user's guide can learn how to use it), theworkshops must include basic elements to develop critical thinking in theparticipants, before the programmes. [24]I designed a one-semester workshop-seminar, titled Herramientas informáticaspara el análisis cualitativo (Computer Tools for Qualitative Data Analysis), andproposed it to the Department of Psychology at the Universidad de los Andes. Itwas accepted and I lectured its first version during the second semester of 2001to last year Psychology undergraduate students1. I want to present here somecritical issues raised from this experience, issues that I believe show us new waysto train qualitative researchers in the use of programmes to assist qualitativeanalysis. [25]3.1 Giving more information than developing skillsWEITZMAN and MILES (1995) designed a worksheet with four key questions toguide researchers to choose the right software. The questions are (p.9): (1) Whatkind of computer user am I? (2) Am I choosing for one project or the next fewyears? (3) What kind of project(s) and database(s) will I be working on? (4) Whatkind of analysis am I planning to do? I consider these four questions to becurrently valid, though they were formulated in 1995. Here I want to paraphrasethe first question. [26]Most of current CAQDAS workshops (it does not matter which programme), arefocused on the use of the programme; i.e., the main goal is that participantsacquire the basic skills in the use of a software. As seen above, all the workshopsannounced on mailing lists refer to one-day or two-day workshops. Basically,what most trainers do in workshops is to show participants how to import1 A second version will be lectured in the second semester of 2002, focused on four of the mostused qualitative methods, and the use of one qualitative programme to assist them.© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(2), Art. 14, Diógenes Carvajal:The Artisan's Tools. Critical Issues When Teaching and Learning CAQDASdocuments into the software, how to create codes or categories (althoughKELLE, 1996, differentiates codes from categories), how to code, how to createand/or test hypothesis and how to make reports. I myself began by doing so inthe first workshops I ran. Paraphrasing WEITZMAN and MILES (1996), what kindof CAQDAS users are we training? I wondered. [27]To use a CAQDAS is more than knowing how to import documents, code themand make reports. It is not only to fit the software to the methodology theresearcher is using or vice versa, as shown in the related case. It is also to knowhow our methodology relates to the tools the software has. I have knownresearchers who believe that the more tools they use the more complete theiranalysis is. And other researchers who believe that because the programme doesnot have the tools they need, it means that their research has exceeded theprogramme's capacities. Both of these are misconceptions of what the tools andthe programmes are for. [28]The students that registered for my seminar were particularly interested in theuse of CAQDAS to analyse the data of their undergraduate thesis. But after ourfirst session they were disenchanted: I told them that only in the sixth session wewere going to use software. The first five sessions were focused on theintroduction to the seminar, the history of CAQDAS, their main characteristics, theprocess of coding in qualitative research, and the relation between theory-building software and Grounded Theory. This last topic was included to preventstudents believing that Grounded Theory is the right methodology to be usedwhen working with CAQDAS. [29]After these seminar sessions, we went into the workshop sessions. I trained mystudents in the use of EZ-Text, winMAX 99, NUD.IST 4, and Atlas.ti 4.2. I hadplanned to work with HyperRESEARCH too, but we did not have enough time. Bythe end of the semester we returned to the seminar sessions to discuss the useof the programmes and the relation between software and qualitative methods.Each of my students was using a particular methodology in his/her thesis, so wecould share our points of view about the way each one was going to use thechosen software. [30]In the last session they told me that they had finally understood why the first fivesessions were more theoretical than they expected. It is worth saying that all thestudents who attended my seminar had previously taken a seminar on QualitativeResearch, but had no previous knowledge on CAQDAS. [31]I have stated that CAQDAS workshops are open to everyone who wants to use aprogramme of this kind; it is not a prerequisite to be a qualitative researcher or tohave a background on qualitative methodology. Must CAQDAS be limited to beused only by qualitative researchers? I do not think that is the solution. I believethat CAQDAS workshops must include training in qualitative methods if theparticipants do not have previous knowledge of it. But if participants do, it is worthhighlighting that the software is nothing but a tool. A tool that researchers can usein several ways, according to their methodology and needs. Researchers must© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(2), Art. 14, Diógenes Carvajal:The Artisan's Tools. Critical Issues When Teaching and Learning CAQDASnot limit their analysis to the tools that the software has nor be obliged to use allthe tools, either. [32]3.2 Promoting critical thinking instead of mechanical thinkingHow many of CAQDAS trainers are CAQDAS critics? Most of them defend theadvantages CAQDAS brings; but how many of them present on their workshopsthe disadvantages these programmes bring? To know a software is to knowabout the methodological implications its use has for qualitative methodology.There are lots of papers, articles and even books about this topic. But how muchof this literature is included as basic bibliography in the workshops? I know thatsome workshops led by universities world-wide promote the discussion about therelationship between CAQDAS use and qualitative methodology. But most ofworkshops do not. I think that there is an economical factor for this: one-day ortwo-day workshops are income producing. To include more information in theworkshops would imply more than two or three sessions, and it would increasethe cost for participants, which would also have a bearing on the number of them.But if we are to do things, we are to do them right. [33]It is not up to the participants who attend a CAQDAS workshop to discover thedisadvantages that the use of a specific programme could bring to his/heranalysis process. We must warn novice CAQDAS users about the consequencesneophilia brings and include readings about the relation between qualitativeresearch and the use of CAQDAS, about the criticisms the use of CAQDAS inqualitative research have received, and about research projects assisted with aprogramme. In addition to the hands-on workshops the readings can bringparticipants the opportunity to create their own criterion of CAQDAS. [34]The discussion about the methodological implications that the use of CAQDASbrings to qualitative methodology has been limited to academics. It has becomean almost theoretical topic not included in CAQDAS workshops. But I believe thatevery CAQDAS user has something to say about this, if he/she is given thechance2. Every month there are lots of new researchers trained in the use of aprogramme to assist qualitative analysis. Even the way all these researchers areusing programmes is a researchable field. The academic discussion has to betaken out to the public, and researchers of every kind must be included on it. Thecreation of a specific "discussion group" about this topic (be it real or virtual)would be a great idea3. [35]This aspect (developing critical thinking) is related to what I presented in Section3.1. The more information we include in the workshops, the more criticalparticipants will be. The lack of information and the neophilia are the twoelements that would lead us to weak qualitative analyses, giving weight to thosewho believe that to introduce computers in qualitative research is counter-2 FIELDING and LEE (1998) carried out a project asking users what they were doing.3 Mailing lists such as QUAL-Software are focused on the diffusion of the programmes and onlyfrom time to time some list members question the methodological aspects regarding the use ofthe software.© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(2), Art. 14, Diógenes Carvajal:The Artisan's Tools. Critical Issues When Teaching and Learning CAQDASproductive. It is also possible that some of the trained researchers begin to becritical before CAQDAS when using a programme on their own research. Thatwas my case. Nonetheless, I think that by introducing aspects like someprogramme's weaknesses and the way they organise and systematise the data,participants will not fall in neophilia and will be careful when using a programmeto analyse their data. [36]3.3 When "Bring your own data" means "Analyse your own data"As we could see in Section 2.3, only 7 out of the 44 mentioned CAQDASworkshops invited participants to bring their own data. I know it is impossible towork individually with every participant on his/her own data. It is better to offerpersonal advice to researchers. Besides, for academic purposes, it is easier togive the participants in a workshop the same documents to do exercises with aprogramme: we will always know what segments of the document (be it text,images, sound or video) the participants are working with. But is it not aworkshop's goal that participants know how to analyse their own data? Of course;but they will only work on their data when returning to their research projects. Andthe work of trainers ends when the workshops end; and by experience I havelearned that giving your telephone number for further questions is not a good ideaat all. [37]My experience with the seminar in the Universidad de los Andes showed me thatonly when participants begin to analyse their own data, can really understand theway the software works and how to use it according to their methodology. I usedmy own material to train my students, although they began to analyse their ownthesis material by the mid-semester. From that moment the questions they hadabout the use of the software increased a hundred percent. By the end of thesemester they suggested to me to allow them to use their own data from thebeginning: "it was easier for me to use the programme when analysing myinterviews, because I knew what my research question was, and what I waslooking for in the answers of my interviewees", one of them said, and the othersagreed. [38]I believe that once the participants have been trained in the basic tools of aprogramme, it is time to allow them to experience the programme by themselves.By doing so, they will find the best way to segment and code their data, and howcodes and categories can be organised. Trainers must not only guide participantsin the appropriate use of the software according to the methodology participantsare using, but they also have to confront them with the decisions they have tomake in the process of analysis. [39]Of course, this is only possible if the workshops are not limited to one or twodays. This process of accompanying novice CAQDAS users implies a long timecourse. I think that this process is only possible in academic environments(undergraduate and postgraduate research students), or with full-time and part-time researchers really interested in the use of a programme to assist theiranalysis. But people interested only in the mechanical operation of the software© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(2), Art. 14, Diógenes Carvajal:The Artisan's Tools. Critical Issues When Teaching and Learning CAQDAScan be trained in one session. I myself was trained in a three-hour session onNUD.IST 4, the first programme to assist qualitative analysis I knew; nonetheless,only when analysing my own data did I found that there was something missing inthe programme and its relation to qualitative methodology. [40]3.4 The wide panorama: there is no "best" programmeCAQDAS workshops are planned to train in the use of only one programme. Onlyone of the above mentioned workshops was intended to show participants morethan one programme (the course on Computer Assisted Qualitative DataAnalysis), but it was not precisely a training workshop. I believe that when trainingpeople who do not have previous knowledge of any software to assist qualitativeanalysis, we must show them that there is not only one programme. We must tellthem about the wide variety of software available and the different functions theyhave. I know that training in the full use of a programme would imply a very longprocess; but by giving participants the basic tools of various programmes, and byallowing them to experience the software with their own data, they would selectthe appropriate programme according to the tools it has and the type of analysisthe participants are going to do. I have already related the case of the researcherwho wanted to buy the "best" programme. She trained herself with the demoversion of NUD.IST Vivo, and decided that that was the best programme, but didnot try other software. [41]As shown in Section 2.3 most of CAQDAS workshops are on Atlas.ti, NUD.ISTversions Vivo, 4 and 5, and a smaller number on winMAX and The Ethnograph.But there are many other programmes: AQUAD, CoAn, Code-A-Text, Diction,DIMAP, HyperRESEARCH, KEDS, TEXTPACK, TexSmart, and BEST, amongothers. It is not that someone interested in the use of a CAQDAS must be trainedin all of this software, but if trainers show participants the wide variety of existingprogrammes and their main characteristics and functions, participants will havereal elements to choose the software that better fits their needs. [42]In my seminar I trained my students in the use of the basic tools of fourprogrammes, with the possibility of using the complete version of three of them.This, combined with discussions about the methodology they were going to useon their thesis, gave us the opportunity to choose the most adequate software fortheir particular needs. In the end, all of the participants chose the same softwarealthough their methodologies were very different. To decide what software to use,they took into account two factors: the user-friendliness and the flexibility. Theytold me that they did not want a programme that was very rigid in the organisationof the categories and material; they preferred a programme that would allow themto play with the categories and to create their own relations among all theelements of their research. "Flexibility; that's the clue", they concluded. [43]© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(2), Art. 14, Diógenes Carvajal:The Artisan's Tools. Critical Issues When Teaching and Learning CAQDAS4. Closing Note4Computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software has become a basic tool forqualitative researchers; a tool to aid them in their process of analysis. Cutting withscissors and pasting with glue, our traditional way of systematising our data, isnow seen as archaic work. However, we cannot forget that that way ofsystematising was widely used by every qualitative researcher round the worlduntil a decade ago; even today some researchers still use index cards andcabinets to organise their data. And it works. [44]What are the advantages of using software to assist qualitative analysis, then?These programmes facilitate the processes of segmenting, categorising,annotating, retrieving, and searching within and across documents andcategories. All of this can be done in a fast way, and the original documents arenot fragmented. Researchers can find what they want just by doing the rightselection, and the PCs can store lots of documents that otherwise required bigcabinets and folders. The programmes by themselves are neither good nor badfor qualitative research. It is the way that qualitative researchers use them thatinfluences qualitative methodology. Even so, in some cases, programmes havereplaced the method. And it is a real fact that some programmes, especiallythose based on Grounded Theory, include new tools that were not used before inqualitative methods. These new tools imply new ways of doing qualitative analysis(KELLE, 1996), but are not intended to be a method by themselves. [45]Every qualitative researcher who uses CAQDAS is responsible if the programmereplaces the method. Over all, this is a responsibility of every researcher whotrains in the use of CAQDAS. We cannot believe that these programmes are thepanacea in qualitative analysis just because they are widely used today. InColombia the use of this software is still limited to small groups of researchers. Ibelieve this is the reason why it was easy for me to notice that the workshopsfocused on the use of the software would raise methodological implications forqualitative research. [46]Based on my experience, I have presented four critical issues that I believequalitative researchers must bear in mind when training or being trained in theuse of CAQDAS: giving more information, promoting critical thinking, thepossibility of analysing participant's own data, and knowing the wide variety ofprogrammes. These issues would prevent a misuse of CAQDAS and wouldstrengthen qualitative research methods. The programmes are the tools and weare the artisans. It is up to us how we use them. [47]4 Once this article was finished I received information about two articles that discusses this topic:MANGABEIRA, LEE and FIELDING (2001) and FIELDING and LEE (2002), of whichconclusions I do not reference here. The first article, specially, is about two studies the authorsdid with CAQDAS users and their expectations. Their findings in the United Kingdom are verysimilar to the ones I found in Colombia.© 2002 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/fqs/FQS 3(2), Art. 14, Diógenes Carvajal:The Artisan's Tools.
