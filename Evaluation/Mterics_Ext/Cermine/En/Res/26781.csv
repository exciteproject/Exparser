Tempo adjustment of thetotal fertility rate (TFR) requires data on the annual number of births by parity andage of the mother. Since ofﬁcial statistics do not provide such data for West Ger-many as well as Eastern Germany from 1990 on we used alternative data sourceswhich include these speciﬁc characteristics. The combined picture of conventionalTFR and tempo-adjusted TFR* provides interesting information about the trendsin period fertility in Western and Eastern Germany, above all with regard to thedifferences between the two regions and the enormous extent of tempo effects inEastern Germany during the 1990s. Compared to corresponding data for popula-tions from other countries, our estimates of the tempo-adjusted TFR* for Easternand Western Germany show plausible trends. Nevertheless, it is important to notethat the estimates of the tempo-adjusted total fertility rate presented in this papershould not be seen as being on the level of or equivalent to ofﬁcial statistics sincethey are based on different kinds of data with different degrees of quality.Keywords: Germany · Fertility · Fertility trends · Tempo adjustment · Tempo-adjustedTFR · Bongaarts – Feeney · Total fertility rate · East-West comparison ·Parity · Biological birth order · Average age at childbirth1IntroductionThe East-West German differences in fertility trends which have been observedover many decades are probably the most frequently studied aspect of the demo-graphic differences between Eastern and Western Germany. Above all the changesin Eastern German fertility have been frequently studied in recent years (e.g. Dorb-ritz 1992; Menning 1995; Witte/Wagner 1995; Conrad et al. 1996; Beck-Gernshe-im 1997; Dorbritz 1997; Sackmann 1999; Lechner 2001; Sobotka 2002; Kreyenfeld2003; Kreyenfeld 2009), and are regarded as the main characteristic of the “demo-graphic shock” experienced by the population in the new Federal Länder after the© Federal Institute for Population Research 2011DOI: 10.4232/10.CPoS-2010-14enURL: www.comparativepopulationstudies.deURN: urn:nbn:de:bib-cpos-2010-14en2606 • Marc Luy, Olga Pötzschpolitical changes (Eberstadt 1994). The level of fertility and its changes over timeare particularly important because they have the strongest long-term impact on theage structure of a population (Luy 2009). This is why the determinants of fertilityand of childlessness in the context of the speciﬁc backgrounds of life in Westernand Eastern Germany have been analysed intensively in recent years (e.g. Dorbritz/Schwarz 1996; Hank 2002; Dornseiff/Sackmann 2003; Hank/Kreyenfeld 2003; Hanket al. 2004; Butterwege et al. 2005; Eckhard 2006; Boehnke 2007; Bernardi/Keim2007; Bernardi et al. 2008; Arránz Becker et al. 2010; Pötzsch 2010).For most politically and socially relevant questions the absolute numbers ofbirths are of primary interest since these determine the future numbers of kinder-garten children, school pupils, students, employed persons or pensioners, albeitthe size of these population groups is additionally determined by mortality and mi-gration. Demographic fertility research, by contrast, studies primarily the relativefertility quantum in order to be able to describe changes and differences betweenpopulations and to identify the corresponding determinants and inﬂuencing factors.The demographic indicator used most frequently in the ﬁeld of period analysis – i.e.the analysis of fertility conditions in a speciﬁc calendar year – is the “total fertilityrate” (TFR) which is often interpreted as the “average number of children”. However,it is generally difﬁcult in the period analysis to give a speciﬁc meaning to such meas-ures. This is only possible in the cohort perspective, in which the fertility of a realcohort is analysed year by year on a longitudinal basis. Period analysis, by contrast,summarizes the fertility of a speciﬁc calendar year using the age-speciﬁc fertilityrates of all women who were between 15 and 49 years old in this calendar year. Bysumming up the age-speciﬁc fertility rates to the total fertility rate, a hypotheticalcohort is constructed which is supposed to represent the current fertility conditions(see Sobotka and Lutz 2010 on the problem of the use of the period TFR for ques-tions of political and societal relevance).The observed or reconstructed number of births of women belonging to a cer-tain cohort can be inﬂuenced by speciﬁc period and cohort effects. In general, theseeffects are not seen as distortions, but rather as causal determinants of cohort fer-tility and are thus of central interest of the analysis. Period analysis, by contrast,aims to describe the “pure” fertility level of a speciﬁc calendar year– the so-called“quantum of fertility” – without including any other structural factors determiningor inﬂuencing the level of fertility. A classical structural factor inﬂuencing the overallfertility level is the age composition of a population, which can have a major impacton the number of births. Thus, demographic period indicators such as the TFR arecalculated as age-standardised measures. (Although cohort indicators are gener-ally calculated age-standardised as well, no comparable distortion effects of theage composition can occur here).At the end of the 1990s, Bongaarts and Feeney (1998) showed that changes inthe average age at childbirth occurring during a calendar year alter fertility rates andhence the TFR, a phenomenon that has been described already by Hajnal (1947).Bongaarts and Feeney (1998) referred to this alteration of the TFR as a “tempo ef-fect” and proposed to not only standardize the total fertility rate by age, but to alsoadjust the TFR for tempo effects. The basic idea of Bongaarts and Feeney is thatEstimates of the Tempo-adjusted Total Fertility Rate in Western and Eastern Germany • 607tempo effects are also a structural factor distorting the TFR when this indicatoris used to reﬂect the pure quantum of current fertility. An increase in the averageage at childbirth during the analyzed calendar year leads to a tempo effect-causedreduction in the fertility rates, and a reduction in the average age at childbirth leadsto a tempo effect-caused increase in the fertility rates. Even though the existenceof such tempo effects in the period TFR is not questioned among demographers,opinions as to the need for the tempo adjustment diverge in some respects. None-theless, the additional use of the tempo-adjusted total fertility rate, which is sym-bolised by TFR*, has more and more become the standard in demographic fertilityresearch in recent years. This can be seen in the increasing number of publicationsin which fertility trends and differentials are analysed not only on the basis of theconventional TFR, but also using the TFR* (e.g. Lesthaeghe/Willems 1999; Philipov/Kohler 2001; Goldstein et al. 2003; Sobotka 2003, 2004a, 2004b; Frejka/Sobotka2008; Goldstein et al. 2009). The TFR* is also a part of the standard repertoire of de-mographic indices compiled in the “European Demographic Datasheet”, publishedevery two years by the Vienna Institute of Demography of the Austrian Academy ofSciences (available on the Internet at http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/datasheet/index.html).In most of the above mentioned publications, however, information on the tem-po-adjusted TFR* is missing for some European populations, including Germany.The calculation of the tempo-adjusted TFR* requires the number of births beingseparated not only by age of the mother but also by parity. This information wasnot available for uniﬁed Germany and for former West Germany until 2009 becauseof the statutory regulations. Prior to 2009, the parity was exclusively collected forbirths of married mothers, with the birth order referring solely to children of thecurrent marriage (including pre-maritial children with the current husband). Pre-maritial children with fathers other than the mother’s current husband, as well aschildren from previous marriages, have not been considered and thus did not en-ter ofﬁcial population statistics on parity. Only after the supplement of the Popula-tion Statistics Act in 2009 (Bevölkerungsstatistikgesetz/Federal Law Gazette [BGBl]2007) it was possible to record the so-called “biological birth order” independentlyof the civil status of the mother for the whole of Germany (see Statistisches Bunde-samt 2010).For the new Federal Länder (eastern Germany), the data of the former GDR areavailable for the period prior to 1989. These include all births by parity and year ofbirth of the mother as required for tempo adjustment. After reuniﬁcation, however,the birth statistics were carried out in accordance with the Federal Population Sta-tistics Act, and thus no ofﬁcial data on births by biological parity is available forEastern Germany for the period from 1989 to 2008.This article aims to provide estimates for the TFR* in Western and Eastern Ger-many from the mid-1950s to the present, and hence to close – at least partly – oneof the gaps in international fertility research. In order to separate births by parityas required for tempo adjustment of the TFR, we have used a variety of alternativesources for West Germany as well as for Eastern Germany from 1990 on. These con-tain estimates for the number or proportion of births by parity and age of the mother608 •Marc Luy, Olga Pötzschfor different periods, but they are based in some cases on very small populationsamples with questionable representativity for the overall population. Moreover, inview of the educational and family bias usually found in survey data, it cannot beruled out that some of these data sources lead to systematic distortions in estimat-ing parity and age at childbirth. Another inaccuracy results from the fact that thedata covers different age ranges of the reproductive life span. Although the tempo-adjusted fertility rates derived from these data are rather plausible when comparedto corresponding estimates for other countries with better data bases, it is impor-tant to note that the estimates presented in this paper should not be seen as beingon the level of or equivalent to ofﬁcial statistics since they are based on differentkinds of data with different degrees of quality.The methods, and above all the data, on which our estimates of the TFR* forGermany are based are described in detail in the next section. Then we present theresults for Western and Eastern Germany both in an intra-German as well as in aninternational comparison. Finally, we summarise the most important ﬁndings anddiscuss brieﬂy interpretation-related and methodical aspects of the tempo-adjustedtotal fertility rate. Note that the latter issue as well as a detailed analysis of the fer-tility trends in Western and Eastern Germany are not the central purpose of thispaper. Nonetheless, the advantages and disadvantages of the tempo-adjusted TFR*should be at least brieﬂy summarised for those who have not followed the very de-tailed discussion on tempo adjustment or those who have not studied it in detail.2Data and methodsThe conventional total fertility rate (TFR), which is published by the German FederalStatistical Ofﬁce on an annual basis, is calculated from the sum of the age-speciﬁcfertility rates f(x), which are calculated by dividing the number of all births of womenaged x, B(x), by the number of women aged x, P(x):TFR ¦DEf(x)¦DEB(x) .P(x)(1)Since all indicators in this article refer to periods, we refrain from using an ad-ditional index for the calendar year as far as possible for reasons of simpliﬁcation.The parameters α and ß represent the lowest and highest ages of women’s repro-ductive life span, which are usually deﬁned as 15 and 49 years. When totalling theage-speciﬁc fertility rates, they all take on the same weight in the resulting TFR, sothat – as has already been mentioned in the introduction – the TFR primarily consti-tutes an age-standardised fertility indicator.The basic idea behind tempo adjustment of the TFR is not only to standardize forage but also for shifting effects which emerge in a calendar year when the averageage of women at childbirth changes during that calendar year (see Bongaarts/Feeney1998, 2006, 2010). The direction of these changes can differ between parities. SinceEstimates of the Tempo-adjusted Total Fertility Rate in Western and Eastern Germany • 609the parities take on different weights in the overall TFR, the tempo adjustment ofthe TFR according to the method of Bongaarts and Feeney (1998) is performed ona parity-speciﬁc basis. This requires separating the TFR in its parity-speciﬁc com-ponents. The TFR for a parity i is calculated by summing up the corresponding age-and parity-speciﬁc fertility rates f(x)i which differ from the age-speciﬁc fertility ratesin equation (1) in that the numerator does not contain all births of women aged x,but only births of parity i, B(x)i:Note that these age- and parity-speciﬁc fertility rates f(x)i are no probabilities(or any related measure) of the transition of a parity i to the next parity i+1. For thispurpose, the denominator of the rates should not include all x-year-old women,but only those who actually belong to the female population at risk of giving birthto a child of the i-th birth order (e.g. childless women in the calculation for parity1). The age- and parity-speciﬁc fertility ﬁgures from equation (2) rather representthe elements of a purely formal parity-speciﬁc decomposition of the TFR as can bedemonstrated easily. Subdividing the age-speciﬁc numbers of births B(x) in equa-tion (1) into the parities B(x)1 (ﬁrst births), B(x)2 (second births), B(x)3 (third births)and B(x)4+ (fourth and further children), leads toTFRi ¦f(x)i ¦ȕĮB(x)i .P(x)ȕĮȕĮDEwhich can be reformulated toso that followsTFR ¦TFR ¦TFR ¦4i 1TFRi .B(x)1B(x)2B(x)3P(x)B(x)4 ,B(x)1 ¦P(x)ȕĮB(x)2 ¦P(x)ȕĮB(x)3 ¦P(x)ȕĮB(x)4 ,P(x)Tempo adjustment with the method proposed by Bongaarts and Feeney (1998) isdone within the parity-speciﬁc TFRi. Therefore, the TFRis are divided by one minusthe annual change in the average age at childbirth of parity i, ri, so that the tempo-adjusted parity-speciﬁc TFRi* results from(2)(3)(4)(5)610 • Marc Luy, Olga PötzschTFRi*TFRi .1 ri(6)(7)(8)(9)ri(t)MABi(t 1) MABi(t 1) .2MABiȕ¦ (x 0,5) f(x)iĮȕ¦ f(x)iĮ.4TFR* ¦ TFRi * .i 1The change in the average age at childbirth of parity i can be estimated by halv-ing the difference between the average parity-speciﬁc age at childbirth, MABi, inthe following year and the preceding year (see Bongaarts and Feeney 1998).

The ofﬁcial statis-tics of the GDR (East Germany) recorded all births by parity and year of birth of themother, and thus the tempo-adjusted TFR* for East Germany for the period 1955 to1987 can be directly estimated from these data. For the new Federal Länder sinceuniﬁcation in 1990 (Eastern Germany) as well as for the territory of the former Fed-eral Republic of Germany (West respective Western Germany), ofﬁcial data on thebiological birth order are only available since 2009. In order to carry out the parity-speciﬁc subdivision of the birth numbers necessary for the tempo adjustment ofthe TFR for West respective Western Germany and Eastern Germany from 1990onwards, it was necessary to use alternative data sources:• Birg et al. (1990) provided an estimate of the parity-speciﬁc subdivision ofbirths in the Federal Republic of Germany for the years 1958 to 1985. Theestimates were based on the family biographies collected in the context ofthe research project entitled “Labour market dynamics, family development••Estimates of the Tempo-adjusted Total Fertility Rate in Western and Eastern Germany • 611and generative conduct” in 1986, promoted by the DFG, which included 793women and 783 men of the cohorts born in 1950 and 1955 from Düssel-dorf, Hannover, Bochum, Gelsenkirchen, Gronau, Ahaus, Vreden and Leer.For each child of these respondents, the family biographies contain both theactual birth order and the birth order information used by the West GermanStatistical Ofﬁce at that time. From the corresponding relative frequencies(obtained for single ages of the mothers by means of linear regression mod-elling), both the parity-speciﬁc births in marriage, and the non-marital birthswhich were recorded in ofﬁcial statistics on a non-parity-speciﬁc basis, weretransferred into an estimate of the biological parities by single age of themother. The authors used constant parity-speciﬁc subdivisions as obtainedfrom the project sample for both the children born in wedlock and those bornout of wedlock for every year from 1958 to 1985.Kreyenfeld (2002) combined the ofﬁcial birth numbers for West respectiveWestern Germany from 1985 to 1995 with parity-speciﬁc frequencies de-rived from the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) similarly to Birg et al. (1990).However, only the non-marital births of the SOEP samples for West/WesternGermany and for foreigners (211 cases in total) were used for the subdivisioninto the respective birth orders by means of a time-variable multinomial logitmodel. As a consequence of this modelling procedure, the estimated age-speciﬁc parity distributions differ slightly from year to year, in contrast to theestimates of Birg et al. (1990). For marital births, Kreyenfeld (2002) used theofﬁcial data on birth order of parents who were married to one another.For the years 1995 to 1999 (Western Germany) and 1995 to 2000 (EasternGermany) we could use the data of the perinatal survey compiled and kindlymade available by Dr. Manfred Voigt (University of Greifswald). This surveyhas been carried out since the 1980s directly in West German birth clinicswith the aim of improving the quality of perinatal medicine. Participationin the survey, which was conducted by the Bundesländer themselves until2000, has been obligatory for all clinics since 1995 (see Goerke/Lack 2000;Kreyenfeld et al. 2010). In contrast to ofﬁcial statistics, the perinatal surveyincludes the birth order for all births a woman has ever had. Because of theaim and the method of the survey, the perinatal survey exclusively containsbirths which took place in clinics, what applies to the majority of all birthsin Germany. Dr. Voigt was able to collect the perinatal survey data for all theFederal Länder with the exception of Baden-Württemberg. Despite the ob-ligatory participation for all hospitals, the dataset for the years 1995 to 1997contains only approx. 70 % of all 1,656,339 births registered in Germanyduring these years. The percentages for the single calendar years are about65 % in 1995, 78 % in 1996 and 66 % in 1997. Nevertheless, the availability ofthe data for the Federal Länder enabled us to estimate parity-speciﬁc propor-tions of births by the age of the mothers for Eastern and Western Germanyseparately. For this purpose we used the absolute numbers without addi-612 • Marc Luy, Olga Pötzsch•tional smoothing. Since Berlin is included as one overall unit in the perinatalsurvey – as in the ofﬁcial statistics from 2000 onwards – we excluded thecapital from our analysis.Kreyenfeld et al. (2010) also used the data of the perinatal survey, which havebeen compiled for the whole federal territory since the beginning of the 21stCentury by the German National Institute for Quality in Healthcare (Bundes-geschäftsstelle Qualitätssicherung), to estimate parity-speciﬁc birth num-bers for the years from 2001 to 2008. But also these data are only virtuallycomplete from 2004 onwards. Some hospitals as well as entire Bundesländerare missing in the years before, such as Hessen, Schleswig-Holstein and theSaarland in 2001. The authors report that 4,978,381 births are recorded (anduseable) for the entire period from 2001 to 2008, corresponding to 89 % ofall births registered in Germany in these years. The shares in 2001, 2002 and2003 are however only between 62 and 85 %. Kreyenfeld et al. (2010) pro-vide the parity-speciﬁc birth numbers derived from these data separately forEastern and Western Germany, with all of Berlin being allocated to EasternGermany. Like the data from the perinatal survey from 1995 to 1999 respec-tive 2000 (see above), the data used by Kreyenfeld et al. (2010) are basedsolely on births which took place in hospitals. Using data from Germany’sofﬁcial health reporting (Gesundheitsberichterstattung des Bundes) and sta-tistics of the Association for Quality in Out-of-Hospital Births (Gesellschaftfür Qualität in der außerklinischen Geburtshilfe e.V. – QUAG), the authorsfound that roughly one to two percent of all births took place outside hospi-tals between 2001 and 2008. Although these ﬁgures include primarily higher-parity births, taking them into account only leads to negligible changes in theparity-speciﬁc subdivision derived from the data of the perinatal survey (seeKreyenfeld et al. 2010).• In order to close the gap arising from the above mentioned data sourcesfor Western Germany in the year 2000, we also analyzed the parity-speciﬁcbirth numbers of ofﬁcial statistics for the period 1998 to 2002. As has al-ready been described, these ﬁgures only include children born to parentswho are currently married to one another including their joint pre-maritalchildren. The quality of the TFR* estimated on the basis of these data mainlydepends on the extent of deviations between the average age at childbirth ofthe women by the biological birth order and by the birth order in the currentmarriage. Analysing the new ofﬁcial statistics for 2009 one asserts that thisextent mainly depends on the proportion of non-marital births (StatistischesBundesamt 2010). The difference between the age of the mother at the ﬁrstbirth in the current marriage and the age of the mother at the ﬁrst birth in herlife was 0.9 years in Western Germany in 2009 with the proportion of extra-marital ﬁrst births being 36 %. The proportion of extra-marital births wassmaller among second and further births, namely between 17 % and 19 %,and the corresponding age difference was only 0.3 years. The inﬂuence ofEstimates of the Tempo-adjusted Total Fertility Rate in Western and Eastern Germany • 613re-marriage was weak: 93 % of ﬁrst births in the current marriage in 2009were also the ﬁrst births in the life of the mother. The concordance betweenbiological and marital birth order was even larger in second and furtherbirths. Thus, since the proportion of births of unmarried women among alllive births in Western Germany in the years 1998 to 2002 was between 16 %and 21 % (Statistisches Bundesamt 2008, Tab. 1.1.1 to 1.1.3), the informationon the marital birth order forms a relatively sound basis for estimating theTFR*. The situation for Eastern Germany is different what prohibits using theinformation from ofﬁcial statistics on the marital birth order: The proportionof extra-marital births is much larger than in Western Germany. The propor-tion of extra-marital births among ﬁrst births was 74 % in 2009, and amongsecond and further births it was still far above 40 %. The difference betweenthe age at the ﬁrst birth in the life of the woman and the age at the ﬁrst birth inthe current marriage was 2.3 years. Between second and further births, theage difference was 0.9 and 0.8 years, respectively. Furthermore, 20 % of thewomen had already given birth before the ﬁrst child in the current marriagewas born. The proportion of extra-marital births in the new Federal Länderin the period between 1998 and 2002 was more than twice as high as in theWest, and it increased more rapidly: from 47 % in 1998 to 55 % in 2002.Table 1 summarizes the data sources used. As far as we know, these containthe only data existing for the German population which provide the subdivision ofbirths into ﬁrst births (parity 1), second births (parity 2), third births (parity 3) andhigher-order births (parity 4+) for the years 1955 to 2008. Since the case numbersin the data sources used differ from the total number of births registered in Westernand Eastern Germany, the relative parity-speciﬁc subdivision of births, calculatedfrom the data sources, was applied to the total number of births in Western andEastern Germany as published by the statistical ofﬁce. In formal terms, the age- andparity-speciﬁc numbers of births B(x)i were estimated as follows:with B(x) denoting the ofﬁcial overall number of births of x-year-old women, andB(x)iB(x)  B' (x)iB' (x)(10)B‘(x)i and B‘(x), respectively, denoting the number of births of parity i of x-year-oldwomen as well as the corresponding total number of births included in the respec-tive data source. From these age- and parity-speciﬁc birth numbers and from thenumbers of living women aged 15 to 49 published by the statistical ofﬁce, it waspossible to derive age- and parity-speciﬁc fertility rates for single ages of the moth-ers which ﬁnally enabled us to estimate the parity-speciﬁc TFRi from equation (2) aswell as the parity-speciﬁc age at childbirth MABi from equation (8). The tempo-ad-justed total fertility rates TFR* were ﬁnally calculated as shown in equation (9). Forparities 1, 2 and 3 we used the tempo-adjusted TFR1*, TFR2* and TFR3* (calculated614 • Marc Luy, Olga PötzschTab. 1:Data sources used to estimate age- and parity-speciﬁc fertility rates(a) Western Germany (former Federal Republic of Germany/old Federal Länder)Data sourceBirg et al.

The corresponding estimates for TFR1, TFR2, TFR3 and TFR4+ foreach calendar year can be found in Annex 1.Figure 1 shows the proportions of the parity-speciﬁc TFRi from 1958 to 2008 cal-culated from these data. Although the time trends of the parity-speciﬁc proportionsof the TFR reveal interesting differences between Western and Eastern Germany,both parts of the country resemble each other in the fact that total fertility is mainlydetermined by parities 1 and 2. All in all, ﬁrst and second born children account for70 % (from the end of the 1950s until the 1960s) to 80-85 % (since the 1970s in East-ern Germany and since the 1980s in Western Germany) of the total number of livebirths in the analyzed period. The proportions of parity 3 remain largely constant inboth Western and Eastern Germany, whilst births of fourth and higher order haveclearly become less signiﬁcant since the 1970s in both parts of Germany and are ofonly minor signiﬁcance for total fertility. With regard to the tempo effect componentin the conventional TFR it is therefore of primary relevance how the average ageat childbirth of mothers of ﬁrst and second children has changed in the analyzedcalendar years.Fig. 1:Proportions of parity-speciﬁc TFRis in the conventional total fertilityrate TFR in Western and Eastern Germany, 1958-2008Notes: Data basis of the estimates for Western Germany for the years 1958-1985 Birg etal.

The values for parity 1 in Western Germany (black dotsin Fig. 2a) are to be found exclusively in the negative range until the beginning ofthe 1970s. This means that the average age of women giving birth for the ﬁrst timeis continuously decreased during these years. The situation is similar for the aver-age age at childbirth of parities 2 (shown in Fig. 2a by white triangles) and 3 (starsignature in Fig. 2c). Consequently, one can presume that tempo effects increasedthe conventional TFR in the years of the baby boom. The changes in the average ageof the mothers of children of fourth and higher order (grey squares in Fig. 2c) show atrend in contrast to parities 1 and 2 between the mid-1960s and the beginning of the1970s. Because of the minor signiﬁcance of parity 4+ for total fertility, this can onlyresult in a slight reduction of the tempo effects caused by parities 1, 2 and 3. Fromthe 1970s to the end of the 1990s, all parities show an almost permanent annualincrease in the average age at childbirth in Western Germany, albeit with varyingintensities. Above all in parity 1, the annual changes are more than 0.1 years in mostcalendar years, with the maximum value of 0.26 being reached in 1983. Only in thesecond half of the 1980s the values for r1 are around zero. Since the early 1990s,there is a rise in the annual increase again, with an overall upward trend until the lastyear of observation. The changes in the other parities are very similar over the entireperiod. In the last years of the observation period, the annual change in the averageage at childbirth among parities 1 to 3 is between 0.15 and 0.20 years, so that theTFR in Western Germany was inﬂuenced most by tempo effects in the 1970s andearly 1980s as well as since the early 1990s.In Eastern Germany, the values for ri of all parities ﬂuctuate around zero from themid-1960s until the end of the 1980s (see Figs. 2b and 2d). The few exceptions relateto parities 2, 3 and 4+ for a short time around 1970 and to parity 4+ at the end of the1970s and at the beginning of the 1980s. All in all, the conventional TFR in EasternGermany should be more or less unaffected by tempo effects in this period. Sinceuniﬁcation, the trends have changed considerably. Unfortunately, for the years be-tween 1987 and 1996 the change in the average age at childbirth cannot be esti-mated. However, the ri values derived for the years from 1996 to 2000 are – aboveall for parities 1 and 2 – very high and much higher than in Western Germany. Thedashed interpolated lines in Figures 2b and 2d between 1987 and 1996 are includedto provide an impression of the massive changes which occurred in the ages atchildbirth among Eastern German mothers during the 1990s. These lines cannot beused to estimate the ri values for the single years of this period, which could indeedhave been rather above the level of 1996 particularly in the ﬁrst half of the 1990s.However, they indicate that the extremely low TFR of Eastern Germany in this pe-riod is caused to a considerable degree by tempo effects. From the beginning of the20th century on the annual change in the average age at childbirth returns to a levelof around 0.2 years among parities 1 and 2, and is hence similar to the West Germanlevel. The ﬂuctuations are larger in parities 3 and 4+ with many of the single valuesbeing around zero. However, as can be seen in Figure 1b, the changes in the ages atEstimates of the Tempo-adjusted Total Fertility Rate in Western and Eastern Germany• 617Fig. 2:Annual changes in the average parity-speciﬁc age at childbirth ri inWestern and Eastern Germany, 1958-2008(a) parities 1 and 2, Western Germany(b) parities 1 and 2, Eastern Germany0,40,30,2sraye 0,1nieng 0,0ahC-0,1-0,2-0,30,40,30,2sraye 0,1nieng 0,0ahC-0,1-0,2-0,3Parity 1Parity 2Parity 3Parity 4+0,40,30,2sraye 0,1nieng 0,0ahC-0,1-0,2-0,30,40,30,2sraye 0,1nieng 0,0ahC-0,1-0,2-0,3Parity 1Parity 2Parity 3Parity 4+1958 1968 1978 1988 1998 20081958 1968 1978 1988 1998 2008Calendar yearCalendar year(c) parities 3 and 4+, Western Germany(d) parities 3 and 4+, Eastern Germany1958 1968 1978 1988 1998 20081958 1968 1978 1988 1998 2008Calendar yearCalendar yearNotes: Data basis of the estimates for Western Germany for the years 1959-1984 Birg etal.

Figure 3 shows the corre-sponding estimates for Western Germany in comparison to the conventional TFR(thin line). All in all, the estimates for the tempo-adjusted TFR* derived from thevarious data sources (designated in Fig. 3 by different symbols) show a coherentoverall trend.Since tempo adjustment with the method of Bongaarts and Feeney (1998) cangenerally lead to distinct annual ﬂuctuations (and here additionally the combinationof different data sources), more robust results are obtained when averaging thetempo-adjusted TFR* for three calendar years (see Goldstein et al. 2009). The result-ing estimates for the TFR* of Western Germany can be found in Table 2a. The thickblack line in Fig. 3 represents the corresponding trend of the TFR* which reﬂectsthe expectations that have already been outlined in connection with the trends inthe annual changes in parity-speciﬁc ages at childbirth. The TFR* is slightly belowthe conventional TFR from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s because the age at child-birth was falling at that time. This shows that the increase in the TFR at the begin-ning of the baby boom in the 1950s was not only caused by the actual increase infertility but also to a slight degree by tempo effects. Similar results were shown forinstance for the USA (Bongaarts/Feeney 1998). At the end of the 1960s and at thebeginning of the 1970s, practically no differences can be found between the TFRand the TFR*.Since the early 1970s, the TFR* in Western Germany has been higher than theconventional TFR. Whilst the TFR stagnated between 1.3 and 1.4 after the fertilitydecline between the second half of the 1960s and the mid-1970s, the TFR* declinedless in the 1970s, and at the beginning of the 1980s the TFR* increased slightly toabout 1.7. The following years show a subsequent decrease in the TFR* that persist-ed until 1990. Since then, the tempo-adjusted total fertility rate shows a more or lesscontinuous increase, reaching almost 1.7 in the last year of the observation period(2008). All in all, although the TFR* is far from the replacement level of 2.1 childrenper woman (upper dashed line in Fig. 3), it lies – in contrast to the conventional TFR– clearly above the level of “lowest-low fertility”, which Kohler et al. (2002) deﬁnedas 1.3 children per woman (lower dashed line in Fig. 3).The differences between the conventional TFR and the tempo-adjusted TFR*also correspond to the expectations for Eastern Germany outlined above on the ba-sis of the estimated annual changes in the average parity-speciﬁc age at childbirth.In Figure 4 the corresponding estimates are, again displayed for the single yearsand the trend in the three-year average of the TFR* (the respective values can befound in Tab. 2b, as well as in Annex 2). It can be seen that tempo effects also led toa slight increase in the total fertility rate during the 1950s in Eastern Germany whichis indicated by the somewhat lower values of the TFR* in comparison to the TFR.Estimates of the Tempo-adjusted Total Fertility Rate in Western and Eastern Germany • 619Fig. 3:Estimates of the tempo-adjusted total fertility rate TFR* in WesternGermany from various data sources, 1950-20103,02,52,0etaryiltitr 1,5elfatoT1,00,50,0TFRTFR* (Kr1)TFR* (AS1)TFR*TFR* (Bg)TFR* (Kr1/AS1)TFR* (Kr2)TFR* (Bg/Kr1)TFR* (PE)TFR*(Kr2/AS2)1950196019701980199020002010Calendar yearNotes: The abbreviations in brackets refer to the data basis for the estimate of the TFR*,Bg = Birg et al.

Con-sequently, there are virtually no differences between the TFR and the TFR* in thisperiod. This changes in the last years prior to reuniﬁcation during which the TFR* inEastern Germany rises in contrast to the decreasing TFR because of the increasingage at childbirth, similar to what can be observed for Western Germany at the endof the 1970s.Although we have only few estimates for the TFR* in the 1990s because of theavailable data sources, these estimates illustrate to what degree the conventionalTFR (and the actual birth numbers) were affected by changes in the mean age atchildbirth in Eastern Germany. Whereas the conventional TFR was only 1.04 in 1997,the estimated tempo-adjusted TFR* is 1.47.

However, the differences in the tempo-adjusted TFR* in the two parts ofGermany are smaller in each phase (and since the second half of the 1990s almostnegligible).

This holds for both versions of the total fertility rate, namely theconventional TFR and the tempo-adjusted TFR*.Finally, Figure 6 (Western Germany) and Figure 7 (Eastern Germany) show thetrends in the TFR as well as in the TFR* in comparison to three other western andeastern European populations for which the corresponding values could be calcu-lated from the Human Fertility Database (HFD) (the TFR* for these populations wascalculated analogously to our estimates for Western and Eastern Germany, i.e. us-ing the tempo-adjusted TFRi* for parities 1, 2 and 3 and the conventional TFRi forthe higher parities, presented by means of three-year moving averages). Equally towhat has been done in Figure 5, the graphs on the left-hand side show the conven-tional TFR and the graphs on the right-hand side show the tempo-adjusted TFR*.The ﬁgures are intended to enable us to evaluate the degree to which our estimatesof the TFR* for Western and Eastern Germany derived from data sources of differ-ent quality can be regarded as plausible.

Austria is comparable to Western Germany with regard to the level andtrend of the TFR since the 1980s (the HFD provides data for Austria only since thistime). In Sweden and in the Netherlands, the TFR has increased in the last ten years,in contrast to the stagnation observed in Western Germany and Austria, where itranges around the level of 1.8 to 1.9 in most recent years. Figure 6b reveals thatthe estimates for the TFR* of Western Germany are also close to the correspond-ing values of Austria, for which age- and parity-speciﬁc birth numbers of the totalpopulation are published directly by the national statistical ofﬁce (Statistik Austria).This ﬁnding holds for the mid-1990s onwards. In the years before, at around 1990,the Austrian TFR* shows a strong ﬂuctuation which is not visible in the conventionalTFR. All in all, the estimates for the TFR* of Western Germany ﬁt well and plausibleinto the picture of the Western European populations. Only in the 1980s and early624 • Marc Luy, Olga Pötzsch1990s the estimates for the TFR* seem somewhat too low. An interesting result isthat in the most recent years the differences in the total fertility rate between West-ern Germany and Austria, on the one hand, and Sweden and the Netherlands, on theother, are much smaller when the TFR is tempo adjusted.Figure 7 also includes one population which seems suitable for comparison withEastern Germany in order to judge the plausibility of our tempo-adjusted estimates.Roughly since 1980, Slovenia shows a similar trend in the conventional TFR com-pared to that of Eastern Germany. In the 1990s, however, both differ when no fer-tility changes comparable to those in Eastern Germany occurred in Slovenia (seeFig. 7a). The two other populations, from the Czech and Slovak Republics, exhibit amuch higher TFR until the mid-1990s, but show similar changes in the fertility levelas the East German population in the ﬁrst half of the 1990s (albeit without recoveryafter the baby bust). The comparison of the estimates for the East German tempo-adjusted TFR* with the corresponding ﬁgures for the three other populations inFigure 7b also shows that the estimates for Eastern Germany seem highly plausible.Total fertility rate in Eastern Germany in comparison to other easternEuropean populations according to the conventional TFR and thetempo-adjusted TFR*, 1950-2010(a) conventional TFR(b) tempo-adjusted TFR*Fig. 7:4,03,53,0tea 2,5rylititre 2,0lfatoT1,51,00,50,0GER EastCZESVKSVN4,03,53,0tea2,5rylititre2,0lfatoT1,51,00,50,0GER EastCZESVKSVN1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 20101950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010Calendar year Calendar yearNotes: Values for the tempo-adjusted TFR* for Eastern Germany (GER East) reﬂect thethree-year moving average of the estimates for the single calendar years (see Tab. 2); thetrend for the TFR* in Eastern Germany for the calendar years 1987-1996 (years with noestimate) was completed by linear interpolation of the values for 1986 and 1997 (dashedlines); values for the Czech Republic (CZE), the Slovak Republic (SVK) and Slovenia (SVN)are calculated with data from the Human Fertility Database (HFD), three-year moving aver-ages.Estimates of the Tempo-adjusted Total Fertility Rate in Western and Eastern Germany • 625There are only minor differences in comparison to the values for Slovenia in the1980s as well as since the beginning of the 21st century. During the 1990s, the muchless pronounced fertility reduction shown by the TFR* in comparison to the con-ventional TFR ﬁts the examples of the Czech and Slovak Republics very well. Bothexperienced declines in the conventional TFR similar to those occurring in EasternGermany during this period.4DiscussionAs already mentioned in the introduction, the main aim of the work for this articlewas the compilation of a time series of estimates for the tempo-adjusted total fer-tility rate in Western and Eastern Germany. To achieve this, we used a variety ofdata sources from which age- and parity-speciﬁc birth numbers could be derived toserve as basis for estimating the tempo-adjusted TFR*. It was possible to constructa complete time series for Western Germany for the years from 1960 to 2007. ForEastern Germany, however, it was not possible to provide such a complete timeseries. We were able to present estimates (by means of three year averages) forthe years 1956 to 1986 and for 1997 to 2007 (the estimates for single calendar yearscover the years 1959-2008 for Western Germany and the years 1955-1987 as well as1996-2008 for Eastern Germany).Although the idea behind Bongaarts and Feeney’s tempo approach (not only forfertility but also for all other demographic events) as well as the arguments of thecritics are described in Luy (2010), we should add a few remarks with regard to theinterpretation and correct attribution of the tempo-adjusted time series presentedin this paper. Particularly the question of the interpretation of the tempo-adjustedtotal fertility rate is not easy to answer, and has already led to a number of misun-derstandings in the corresponding demographic literature. The advantage of theconventional TFR is its clear deﬁnition and interpretation as the sum of the age-spe-ciﬁc fertility rates observed in a given calendar year. In order to explain the meaningof the TFR* as intended by Bongaarts and Feeney, it is necessary to describe thisindicator in a broader context.Independent of the calculation variant (conventional or tempo-adjusted), the aimof the calculation of the total fertility rate for a period is to provide a cross-sectionalmeasure of a population’s current fertility. Therefore, only women who are agedbetween 15 and 49 in the calendar year under observation, i.e. women hence be-longing to 35 different cohorts, are considered. The current fertility of these womenis inﬂuenced to differing degrees by the current political and societal frameworkand their own reproduction histories. In order to obtain a better understanding of aperiod measure, one might imagine that the current age-speciﬁc fertility conditionsare used to construct a scenario for a hypothetical population. All the women ofthis hypothetical population would realise precisely the given age-speciﬁc fertilityat any time. In such a scenario, all female cohorts would have the same ﬁnal aver-age number of children, which equals the average number of children of all women626 • Marc Luy, Olga Pötzschaged between 15 and 49 living in each calendar year. Demographers refer to such ascenario as a “stable population”.A real population whose current fertility is to be characterised by the total fertil-ity rate is naturally never stable. Consequently, period indicators derived in the logicof the stable population always have to be regarded as purely hypothetical. Theidea behind Bongaarts and Feeney’s tempo approach is based on the fact that thenumber of births and the number of women aged between 15 to 49 living in a spe-ciﬁc calendar year do not originate from a stable population. Imagine a rather simpleexemplary case in which each woman has exactly one child, gives birth at exactlythe same age, and that the times of the births are evenly distributed over the year. Inthis scenario, the sum of the age-speciﬁc fertility rates as an indicator of the currentfertility would also be exactly one child per woman in any given calendar year. If,however, the age at which the women give birth to their child continually increases(so that a change in birth timing takes place, but not in birth quantum), the cohortsof women being in reproductive ages in a calendar year would have their childrenover a longer period than one year. In this case, all women living in a speciﬁc calen-dar year would still realise one birth during their lives, but the average value derivedfrom the age-speciﬁc fertility rates for this year would be lower than one.Bongaarts and Feeneys’ approach for characterising the fertility of a speciﬁc cal-endar year takes into account that the current fertility of a real population does notoriginate from a situation in which the age at childbirth of all cohorts currently livingremains unchanged. The idea is hence to adjust the time frames of the birth timesof the newborns and of the cohorts of mothers (i.e. the numerators and denomina-tors of the age-speciﬁc fertility rates) to capture the current birth quantum of thecurrently living women. The adjustment relates exclusively to the above describedexpansion effect of the birth period resulting from the increase in the age at child-birth, assuming that the fertility quantum remains unchanged despite the age shift(analogously, when the age at childbirth declines, the reduction effect of the shorterchildbirth period would be adjusted for).In a stable population, the total fertility rate of a calendar year can be regardedas the average number of children born during the life course of all female cohortscurrently living. In these terms, the conventional period TFR (i.e. the observed to-tal fertility rate of a speciﬁc calendar year) can also be interpreted as the averagenumber of children born by the female cohorts living at the same time in the hypo-thetical population in the course of their reproductive life span. The prerequisite isthat these female cohorts realise exactly the age-speciﬁc fertility rates observed inthe period, i.e. without changes in birth quantum and birth timing. The tempo-ad-justed TFR* is to be equivalently interpreted as the average number of children whoare born to the hypothetical female cohorts living at the same time in the course oftheir reproductive life span if these female cohorts realise the birth quantum of theperiod observed, deﬁned by the age-speciﬁc fertility rates, but with changes in birthtiming. When we reduce the interpretation to the single hypothetical cohort usuallyused, then the TFR* does not reﬂect the age-speciﬁc fertility rates observed in theperiod, but the age-speciﬁc fertility rates adjusted for changes in the birth timingduring the observed year (see also Lesthaeghe/Willems 1999).Estimates of the Tempo-adjusted Total Fertility Rate in Western and Eastern Germany • 627Besides the aspects of birth quantum and birth timing, the age distribution of theparity-speciﬁc fertility rates by the age of the women is also relevant with regardto the tempo adjustment according to the Bongaarts and Feeney formula used inthis article. It becomes evident from equation (6) that the tempo adjustment is ex-clusively based on the change in the average age at childbirth of the parities. Thus,the Bongaarts and Feeney formula implies that the distribution of the age-speciﬁcfertility rates remains constant when shifting with age. Most of the methodical crit-ics of tempo adjustment focus on this feature of the Bongaarts and Feeney method(see e.g. van Imhoff/Keilman 2000; Kohler/Philipov 2001; van Imhoff 2001; Yi/Land2001). In real populations, the changes in the average age at childbirth are indeedaccompanied by variance changes which also exert an inﬂuence on the number ofchildren born in a calendar year. Thus, the increase in the average age at childbirthcan be caused by both an increase in age-speciﬁc fertility in the higher reproductiveage and by a fall in the fertility rates among younger women (in the ﬁrst case, thefertility quantum would increase in the long term; in the latter it would fall). Conse-quently, very different changes in the age distribution of the parity-speciﬁc fertilityrates can lead to identical changes in the average age at childbirth, and hence to anidentical tempo adjustment with the Bongaarts and Feeney formula. Such cases arenot rare and can also be observed in the German population during the calendaryears analysed in this paper.Theoretically it is possible to extend the tempo adjustment to include the effectof changes in the age distribution of the parity-speciﬁc fertility rates as proposedby Kohler and Philipov (2001). In practice, however, feasibility reaches its limit herein most cases because of the detailed nature of the data required. It is thereforeimportant to note that the tempo adjustment with the Bongaarts and Feeney for-mula is merely an approximation of the intended adjustment of the total fertilityrate (see Luy 2010 for details). However, the criticism of the non-consideration ofvariance effects can be countered by two arguments: The ﬁrst concerns the relativesigniﬁcance of changes in the average age at childbirth and in the age distributionof the age-speciﬁc fertility rates for the numbers of births occurring in a speciﬁccalendar year. As Dinkel (1989) has shown by simulations, changes in the averageage at childbirth have a much larger impact on the birth numbers than changes inthe variance of the fertility distribution. It is not likely that the non-consideration ofvariance changes leading to an incorrect direction of the tempo adjustment withthe Bongaarts and Feeney formula occurs frequently, albeit its absolute extent canindeed be distorted. The second argument is that the conventional TFR does notat all account for changes in birth timing. Consequently, also Kohler and Philipov(2001) concluded that an adjustment of the total fertility rate with the Bongaarts andFeeney formula is better for the analysis of period fertility than completely exclud-ing tempo adjustment.This discussion, however, is not aimed to ascertain which measure is bettersuited to characterise period fertility. One should not forget that the TFR and theTFR* are both pure period indicators, and hence both solely reﬂect hypotheticalaverage birth numbers. In case of the conventional TFR, this hypothetical averagebirth number is based on the observed fertility rates of a calendar year, and in the628 • Marc Luy, Olga Pötzschcase of the tempo-adjusted TFR* on the estimated birth quantum of the women liv-ing in this calendar year. The latter cannot be measured, but only modelled, whichis certainly a weakness of the TFR* compared to the conventional total fertility rate.Ultimately, the two indicators are based on somewhat different reference quanti-ties. For the analysis of period fertility it is thus most informative to use them par-allel and supplementing one another, as it was done in all the papers listed in theintroduction.Regarding the empirical results presented in this article, it can be stated thatthe two fertility indicators – the conventional TFR and the tempo-adjusted TFR* –identify different phases in fertility trends in Western and Eastern Germany. In bothparts of the country, the TFR* is lower than the TFR until the end of the 1960s. Thisis a consequence of the decline in the average age at childbirth, in particular withregard to the ﬁrst and second births. The age of the women at the birth of their chil-dren rises markedly in Western Germany in the 1970s and 1980s. As a consequence,the tempo-adjusted TFR* is on average almost 0.18 higher than the conventionalTFR during the years from 1971 to 1987. In the former GDR, by contrast, the age atchildbirth remained relatively constant in this period, so that the tempo-adjustedTFR* and the conventional TFR do not differ signiﬁcantly. Since the beginning of the1990s, the average age at childbirth of Western German women rises once moreafter a brief phase of relative stability. This trend causes an increasing deviation be-tween the estimated TFR* and the conventional TFR in Western Germany. In EasternGermany, we can only presume that the difference between the two indicators wasparticularly large in the ﬁrst half of the 1990s. This is suggested by several indica-tors pointing towards a rapid increase in the age at childbirth of Eastern Germanmothers. An idea of the extent of this difference is provided by the estimates forthe second half of the 1990s. The difference between the tempo-adjusted TFR* andthe conventional TFR in the years 1997-1999 is between 0.37 and 0.43. In the yearsfrom 2000 to 2007, the TFR* in Eastern Germany is on average 0.28 higher than theconventional TFR.Hence, the combined picture of the conventional TFR and the tempo-adjustedTFR* provides interesting results with regard to the trends in period fertility in West-ern and Eastern Germany, which were not analysed in detail in this paper. This ap-plies above all to the West-East differences in the overall trend and the massivetempo effects in Eastern Germany during the 1990s. Since 2009 it is possible toanalyse level and trends of fertility in Germany with tempo-adjusted fertility rateson the basis of parity-speciﬁc data for all births from ofﬁcial statistics. For the periodprior to this we have compiled the best possible estimates. Even if these estimatesare not comparable with the data of ofﬁcial statistics in qualitative terms, the datapresented in this paper enables researchers to include the population of Westernand Eastern Germany in future research on international trends in tempo-adjustedperiod fertility.Estimates of the Tempo-adjusted Total Fertility Rate in Western and Eastern Germany • 629References<ref>Arránz Becker, Oliver; Lois, Daniel; Nauck, Bernhard 2010: Differences in fertility pat-</ref>terns between East and West German women.
