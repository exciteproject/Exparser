But Still Enthusiastic: The Unchanged Europeannessof the Spanish Parliamentary EliteDuring the Eurozone CrisisJuan Rodríguez-Teruel, José Real-Dato & Miguel Jerez∗Abstract: »Immer noch begeistert: Die unveränderte Europäizität der spani-schen parlamentarischen Elite während der Eurozonen-Krise«. Since the adhe-sion of Spain to the EEC in 1986, the Spanish electorate has shown a high levelof support for the European integration process. Even more enthusiastic thantheir fellow citizens, Spanish political elites also expressed a strong commit-ment to the European integration project, based in a pro-EU consensus beyondparty and ideological divides. However, Spain has also been one of the coun-tries most affected by the economic and financial crisis that has hit the EU (par-ticularly the Eurozone) since 2010. The main questions we aim to answer in thispaper is whether this crisis and its management by EU institutions has eroded thetraditional support for the EU shown by Spanish domestic political elites and, ifso, to what extent. To this end, we draw on survey data provided by the InTuneand ENEC-2014 projects on the attitudes of Spanish MPs towards the EU in theyears 2007, 2009, and 2014. Results show that the traditional pro-EU stance ofSpanish MPs has remained mostly stable during the crisis, yet such stability hasincreased the representation gap with citizens in this area.Keywords: Political elites, European integration, attitudes, European Union, Eu-roscepticism, Europeanness, Spain.∗ Juan Rodríguez-Teruel, Department of Constitutional Law & Political Science.

Scholars have detected ero-sion of citizens’ support to political institutions and the main political actors,particularly, mainstream political parties (Mair 2013; Cordero and Simón 2015;Teixeira et al. 2016). As a consequence, an ‘electoral epidemic’ has profoundlyaltered party systems, damaging the social basis of traditional political parties andpushing new challenger actors to parliaments and governments at different levels(Bosco and Verney 2012; Hernández and Kriesi 2016). Spain has been one out-standing example of this transformation, which has brought new parties likePodemos or Ciudadanos to the political landscape (Rodríguez-Teruel and Barrio,2015; Rodriguez-Teruel et al. 2016). These changes have affected not only na-tional institutions but also the traditional support to the European Union (EU),which in turn has fostered the raise of populist forces that question the role ofstates in the European integration. Hence, an increase of critical attitudes of thenational political elites towards the EU in these countries could be spreadingamong voters, and damaging indeed the traditional elite consensus on Europe.This article aims to analyse the consequences of this political turbulence onthe Europeanness of the Spanish parliamentary elite. Spain has been traditionallyone of the more pro-European countries even before its accession to the EuropeanEconomic Community (EEC) in 1986 (Sanchez-Cuenca 2001; Szmolka 2007).This consistency of political attitudes towards Europe has been particularly strongamong domestic elites, beyond party and ideological divides (Jerez et al. 2010;Jerez et al. 2015a). However, Spain has also been one of the countries that hasmost dramatically experienced the consequences of both the economic and finan-cial debt crisis since 2008. This has been accompanied by a deterioration of thesupport to the EU amongst the population. Previous works have suggested thatthis did not occur with the national political elite in the beginning of the crisisperiod (Sojka et al. 2015; Freire and Moury 2015). This article’s main question iswhether things have changed with the subsequent deepening of the economiccrisis. To check the evolution of the attitudes of Spanish political elites towardsthe EU, we will examine survey data collected at three different time points:2007, 2009 and 2014.Our main expectation is that continuity might prevail over change during theobserved period, in line with the continuity that has also characterised composi-tion of the parliamentary elite (Jerez et al. 2016). Indeed, given the traditional1 The authors would like to thank the financial support from the Real Instituto Elcano and theDepartment of Political Science of the University of Granada.

Despite the impact of the Eurozone crisis, until 2015 the mainfeatures of the Spanish party system were very stable. Although the 2011 generalelection produced a serious collapse of the PSOE vote (which led this party tolose the government to the PP), the concentration of the electoral vote and theparliamentary representation amongst mainstream parties did not change signifi-cantly, and those parties with soft Eurosceptic attitudes (Ruiz-Jiménez and Egeade Haro 2011) remained a small minority in the national chamber. Consequently,we expect to find a stable pattern in the main Europeanness traits of the Spanishparliamentary elite, while potential changes in attitudes and opinions could obeyto party variance rather to elite transformation. In this respect, the article assessesto what extent this elite consensus concerning the EU is affected by inter-partydivisions existing due to the politicization of EU issues at the national level.Besides, since these mainstream positions regarding the EU within the elite con-trast with the change in citizens’ attitudes, a resulting scenario would be an in-crease in the gap between elite’s opinions and those of the general population,eroding the traditional elite-mass congruence in Spain regarding the EU.The rest of this article is structured as follows. The second section reviews themain political facts that have shaped the political life in Spain in the last decade,paying particular attention to the main issues related to the EU. Then, the thirdsection introduces the main concepts, expectations and the data employed in thisresearch. Section four analyses the political attitudes regarding the EU in theparliamentary elite. And finally, the concluding section summarize the mainfindings and connects patterns observed in the previous section with the changesin the Spanish political system occurred since 2014.2.A Turbulent Political Time in SpainAlthough the time span strictly covered by the data used in this paper (2007-2014) may look too short to expect relevant changes, the Spanish political andeconomic landscape experienced deep transformations. During this period,there were three different parliamentary terms with episodes of governmentchange, economic instability and social turbulence. Along this time, the refer-ences to the EU in the Spanish political debate have evolved from the optimismduring the referendum for the Constitutional treaty in 2005 to the controversyin 2012-13 about the policy conditions linked to the bailout of the Spanishfinancial system through the European Stability Mechanism.The first government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero (2004-2008) wascharacterised by a period of strong economic development, in which Spainreturned to its traditional support to Germany and France as leading actors inHSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 216the EU, abandoning the transatlantic-oriented policy implemented by the previ-ous prime minister, José Maria Aznar (Delgado et al. 2015). In this respect,Zapatero gave strong relevance to the Spanish role in the process of ratificationof the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. While in other countriesthe Constitutional Treaty raised eurocriticism and division within the elite, inSpain the vote was employed as a legitimacy device for the national govern-ment. Indeed, Spain was one of the few countries in consulting citizens througha referendum before the parliament ratified the document. Despite the clearvictory of those supporting the project2, a low level of public debate about thetext (with a resulting low turnout), and an image of consensus and complacen-3cy amongst political elites weakened the political outcome of the referendum .The good results in terms of economic growth and unemployment lead theSpanish GDP per capita to surpass Italy by the end of 2007, and fostered goodprospects to reduce distance between Spain and the main economies of the EU,Germany and France. In this context, the positions of soft Eurocriticism in theSpanish political elite were mainly related to two concerns (Ruiz-Jiménez andEgea de Haro 2011, 117). On the one hand, there was the criticism from smallradical left parties regarding the lack of attention, from their point of view, tosocial matters in the EU. On the other hand, nationalist parties in Catalonia andthe Basque country remained sceptical about the weak role of regional repre-sentation in the EU institutional framework. By 2007, the Spanish citizensshowed the lowest levels of support to the idea that the Spain had not benefittedfrom belonging to the EU since the access to the CEE in 1986 (Ruiz-Jiménezand Egea de Haro 2011, 122).The context changed dramatically during Zapatero’s second term (2008-2011). The burst of the US real-state bubble in autumn 2008, following thecollapse of Lehman Brothers, had a tremendous effect on the internal situationof Spain and its own housing bubble. However, contrary to other Europeancountries, the Spanish government adopted a moderate approach against thecrisis, with discretionary counter-cyclical fiscal policies and a Keynesian strat-egy (increasing the budget deficit to 11.1% of GDP at the end of 2009), while itwas reluctant to implement serious structural reforms. This helped to maintainthe public’s confidence in a quick exit from the crisis. But the deterioration ofthe situation in Greece eventually forced the EU to intervene in order to hinderthe spread of the risk of default to other Southern European countries. Hence,in May 2010 Zapatero announced a U-turn change in its policy agenda, with2 The referendum was held on the 20th of February 2015, with a turnout of 42,32%. Theconstitutional project was backed by 76,7% of the participants. Some weeks later the Con-greso de los Diputados (the lower house of the parliament) approved the text by 311 votesagainst 10 (0 abstention) as well as the majority of the high chamber did (225 to six votes,and one abstention).3 “Spains’ mixed EU signals”, BBC news, February 21, 2015 <http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4284607.stm>.HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 217emergency cuts and structural reforms aimed at containing the public deficitand avoiding the risk of bailout. In August 2011, PSOE and PP approved anamendment to the Spanish Constitution (article 135) introducing a cap on thestructural deficit of the state.While support for the PSOE’s in the opinion polls shrank following this U-turn in the government’s policies, the new agenda altered the role of the EU inthe Spanish public debate. The EU institutions started to be identified as thepromoters of the austerity policy implemented by the government, being alsoblamed as responsible for the consequences that arouse in the followingmonths. Hence, some relevant intellectuals argued in favour of leaving theeuro4, while support for democracy and to the main political institutions de-clined in parallel to what was happening in Southern European countries(Alonso 2013). Political dissatisfaction also fostered social mobilization againstthe government and the political class, like the massive demonstrations acrossSpain held in May 15th 2011, dubbed the 15-M movement, also known as theindignados (Fominaya 2015).The collapse of the support for the government in the 2011 general electiongave the victory to the PP and paved the way for a majority government headedby Mariano Rajoy. Despite the PSOE’s electoral setback, the two main partiesachieved 73% of the total vote. The new executive did not alter the agenda ofstructural reforms, facing also major pressures from the EU to call for a bailout,after the downgrade of several Spanish banks’ credit ratings. Indeed, the hous-ing bubble crisis was evolved to a financial crisis in the banking system, partic-ularly in the local and regional semipublic saving banks (cajas de ahorro).Finally, the PP government accepted a bailout deal from the EU to the bankingsystem under the form of a loan to recapitalize Spain’s weakest banks (DeGuindos, 2016). In exchange, the government implemented new reforms andaccepted European monitoring of Spanish banking reform. However, the stateof the economy still experienced strong pressures during Rajoy’s first terms.Thus, public debt evolved from 69,5% (2011) to 99,3% of the GDP (2014),public deficit increased to -10,4% (2012), although budget cuts helped to re-duce it to -5.9% (2014). In turn, unemployment peaked in 2013 to almost fivemillion people, while the youth unemployment rate reached 56% by that time,although since 2014 it started to decrease slightly5.The poor economic performance during the first years of the Rajoy govern-ment, and the deepening of the social consequences of the austerity policiesfuelled political disaffection and electoral volatility (Cordero and Montero4 In this respect, Castells (2011) argued that the exit from the Eurozone was the only way forthe recovery of the Spanish economy. Similarly,<ref> Fernández-Albertos and Sánchez-Cuenca(2013) defended that Spain should le</ref>ave the euro if the EU could not strengthen the politi-cal integration.5 The source for all data reported in this paragraph is Eurostat.HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 2182015, 350; Urquizu 2015). In 2012 and 2013 several surveys detected a dra-matic collapse of the support for the two main Spanish parties, while the exist-ing small parties did not really benefited from this (Rodríguez-Teruel 2013),suggesting a failure of the political supply in Spain (Fernández-Albertos 2015).In this context, the European election in May 2014 triggered an unprecedentedelectoral dealignment, with the appearance of new parties like Podemos andCiudadanos on the EP, while the two main parties did not achieved even a 50%of the total vote. The electoral change came mainly from young, urban, politi-cally-informed voters (Cordero and Montero 2015; Fernández-Albertos 2015).Amongst these voters, European attachment was significantly stronger com-pared to the older electorate, although they seemed to express less interest inthe European election (Rodríguez-Teruel 2014). Interestingly, Spain remainedthe largest country in the EU without Eurosceptic and far-right parties.3.3.1Theoretical Expectations and DataExpectations: Stability Rather than ChangeThe financial crisis and its political consequences altered the position of Spainin the EU, as we have argued in the previous section. It changed from a story ofeconomic success to a potential bailout, even though it would be ‘too big tofail’. This turn could not happen without affecting citizens’ perceptions of thepolitical system and its legitimacy, although this negative effect should notnecessarily be immediate (Freire and Moury 2015, 179). Some figures showthat trust in government and its ability to manage the crisis steadily declined asthe crisis hit the Spanish economy, in a more consistent way than in other Eu-ropean countries (Roth 2009, 22). According to previous studies, the way citi-zens perceive their national governments and institutions influences stronglytheir views and support for the EU (Anderson and Reichert 1995; Sánchez-Cuenca 2000). From a utilitarian perspective, this support is also explained bycitizens’ perceptions of welfare gains from integration policies (Gabel 1998;Scharpf 1999). Hence, a regression in policy outcomes and the subsequentdeterioration of the perception of national institutions might erode the supportfor the EU amongst citizens.However, these symptoms might not be necessarily appear among the politi-cal elite. Parliamentarians’ attitudes and perceptions are elaborated and sustainedupon stronger cognitive support, since they are better informed about Europeanissues and have a strongest attachment to the EU (Müller et al. 2012; Sojka et al.2015; Freire and Moury 2015). Indeed, as political representatives know betterthe limits in the EU’s room for manoeuvre, their expectations about the EU roleare more in line with reality. In countries like Spain, where the potential for uni-lateral action is weaker, it might be even the case that such context of crisis couldHSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 219foster support for more integration, as the political elites might perceive thatovercoming the current situation or avoiding new crisis in the future requires asupranational solution. Alternatively, an opposite evolution is also possible, sincepoliticians could adopt more critic positions towards the EU in response to anincrease of Euroscepticism among voters (Hooghe and Marks 2009).The main theoretical expectation in this article is that the attitudes of Span-ish MPs towards the EU have not significantly changed during the crisis. Thishypothesis is in line with the above mentioned arguments about elites’ highercognitive competence and the political stability in parliament during the ob-served period. Therefore, between 2004 and 2014, despite of the electoralchanges mentioned in the previous section, the two main parties, both tradi-tionally pro-EU, accounted for more than 80% of the seats at the lower house.6Yet this does not mean the disappearance of ideological and party differences.In fact, some studies (Ruiz Jiménez and Egea de Haro 2011; Vázquez et al.2014) have found differences in the pro-EU positions of PSOE and PP. Forinstance, the PSOE has traditionally shown a more federalist stance, while thePP has supported a view centred on the coincidence between EU and nationalinterests. Hence, a second theoretical expectation is stable interparty divisionsalong ideological divides in both main parties, even though we do not expectthat these party differences respond to a high politicization of EU issues at thenational level. Consequently, they should not alter the general pattern of strongEuropeanness amongst Spanish elites.3.2Dimensions of EuropeannessOur analysis focuses on the patterns of ‘Europeanness’ is defined here as a“composite set of perceptions and sentiments” that drives political elites deci-sions and behaviours in the European integration (Best, Lengyel and Verzichel-li 2012, 8). In this sense, the concept departs from more generic uses in culturaland identity studies, and captures several aspects of attitudes and preferencestowards European integration. Following those authors, Europeanness becomesa multidimensional concept including the emotive, cognitive-evaluative, andprojective-conative dimensions (ibid. 8). The emotive dimension refers tofeelings of attachment and thus towards the European integration. The cogni-tive-evaluative dimension includes attitudes dealing with the working of theEU and its scope of governance. Finally, the projective-conative dimension isbased on the prospects and preferences for higher levels of European unifica-tion and integration in the future.Hence, the empirical data will be developed in the three sets of indicatorscorresponding to the dimensions previously mentioned. First, attitudes of sup-6 The proportion of seats at the Spanish low chamber by PSOE and PP was 89% (2004), 92%(2008) and 84% (2011).HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 220port for the EU, related to the emotive dimension (trust in EU institutions,attachment to the EU, and general support to the integration process). Second,opinions and preferences on working of EU institutions and their scope ofgovernance (related to the cognitive dimension), including issues about howthe EU faced the financial crisis. Finally, options regarding the future of theEU, including expectations and threats (conative dimension).MPs%Inter-viewsFreq.GenderCompositionWomen MenExperience:First MandateWomen MenExperience:more than one termWomen Men3.3DataTable 1: Sample for Spain in ENEC-2014(PPaPr)tido Popular 52,9 40 13POabrrteidroo ESsopcaiñaloislt(aPSOE) 31,4 26 11IIzzqquuiieerrddaa UPlnuirdaal- 3,1 4 1DUenmióonc,rParcoiagr(eUsPoyyD) 1,4 1 0Grupo ParlamentarioCatalán (Convergencia i 4,6 3 2Unió, CiU)Grupo ParlamentarioVasco (Partido Nacional- 1,4 1 0ista Vasco, PNV)Others 5,1 6 2Total (n) 350 81 29Source: Project ENEC (Spain); Real Dato (2016, 22).27153111452The empirical basis for our analysis comes from the data gathered by the twowaves of the elite survey of the IntUne project (2007 and 2009) and the recentENEC survey (2014) conducted amongst national parliamentarians from sever-al European countries. This allows us to develop a comparative analysis acrossthree parliamentary terms in Spain, covering the different periods described inthe historical section. The content of the IntUne 2007 and 2009 elite surveys inSpain was presented and analysed in previous works (Jerez, Real-Dato andVázquez 2010, 2015a). Regarding the 2014 ENEC survey, it basically repeatedthe structure and questions of the IntUne elite surveys, with some additionalquestions aimed at grasping the mood of national political representatives dur-ing the crisis. The sample consisted of 81 MPs, following the research designof the project (see Table 1). The fieldwork was implemented between October21st 2014 and February 18th 2015 – though almost all but three interviewswere conducted before the end of 2014. Most of the interviews were face-to-face (76.5%), while the rest were conducted by telephone. In this article, thesample is weighted by three criteria: parliamentary group, gender and pastHSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 22144101011115721103299700101181281001123parliamentary experience (Table 1). The deviation rate respect to the designedsample is 1.4% for party, 4.2% for sex (with a slight underrepresentation offemale MPs), and 0.5% for experience.Data collection took place two years after the formation of the PP govern-ment with a strong parliamentarian majority. In this respect, the 2014 ENECdataset differs from the two previous IntUne wages, conducted under PSOEgovernments. The party composition is indeed the main difference betweenboth datasets. Our analysis controls for this factor when it comes to interpretsignificant differences across time, by distinguishing between PSOE and PPparliamentarians, or between left and right parties.4.Findings: The Stability of Spanish Parliamentary Elite’sEuropeannessThe empirical results are presented following the three sets of indicators em-ployed to depict the patterns of Europeanness that we observed in the Spanishelite. Our analysis focus on the extent of change or stability detected in 2014compared to the previous survey waves. In those cases of where significantdifferences are found, we check whether party differences are responsible forthese changes.4.1The Emotive Dimension: Attitudes of Support to the EUMost aspects dealing with the emotive dimension of Spanish parliamentarians’Europeanness does not show major changes during the period 2007-2014 (Fig-ure 1). This general stability confirms the high level of support for Europeanintegration among Spanish MPs. Only the level of trust in the European Par-liament (EP) has experienced a statistically significant increase from 6.3 in2007 to 7.0 in 2014, while in the case of the European Commission (EC) andthe Council of the EU levels of trust remain approximately the same along theobserved period. No changes are also observed in the differences betweenparties except in 2014, where a significant difference appear in the levels oftrust among socialist MPs and those of the PP (6.1 against 7.4 points).The general positive stance is also observable in the indicator of attachmentto the EU. Despite having significantly stronger attachment to the nation and tothe region (Sojka et al. 2015), Spanish representatives are amongst those withhighest levels of attachment to the EU (nine out of ten MPs consider them-selves somewhat or very attached). There has been a steady (but not signifi-cant) increase of four points between 2007 and 2014, mainly because of theevolution of those declaring being ‘very attached’ (ten points of differences),including the 53.1% of the whole group. Therefore, the hard times experiencedby the Southern European countries and the controversy with the EU austerityHSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 22210,05,00,0100,0%95,0%90,0%85,0%80,0%policies do not seems to have eroded the emotive linkage between the Spanishelite and the idea of Europe. Yet, the strongest expression towards Europe islarger amongst the PSOE parliamentarians (61.5% are very attached) comparedto the PP (45%).In turn, the perception that the country has benefit from EU membership hasremained mainly unaltered along time (Figure 1), being the percentage higherthan that for the level of attachment to the EU. This is congruent with the pub-lic opinion view, and confirms Spain as a country in which Europeannessseems clearly rooted on the positive assessment of EU membership. These datasupport the utilitarian explanation of attitudes towards the EU, explained main-ly by the positive outcomes member states and their populations have experi-enced from EU membership (Aspinwall 2007).Figure 1: Trust, Attachment and Evaluation of the Overall Effect of EUMembership2007 2009 2014European Parliament European CommissionEU Council of Ministers Benefit from EU membershipAttachment to EUNote: The right-hand scale refers to the levels of trust in EU institutions, measured on a 0-10scale.

Thus, almost 40% of the Spanish MPs declare in 2014 to besomewhat or very dissatisfied with the democracy in the EU. In this respect,the extent of democratic dissatisfaction is mostly explained by party affiliation,as 57.6% of the PSOE MPs declares a negative assessment regarding the issue(figures are similar for the other minor political parties), while 87.5 of the PPrepresentatives express the opposite view. Moreover, as Figure 2 shows, dissat-HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 223isfaction with the democratic working of the EU has worsened compared to theinitial years of the crisis. The group of individuals declaring in 2014 to be verydissatisfied with democracy in the EU decreased by 11 points with respect to2009. Changes were significant both for the PP and the PSOE, though they runin different directions (satisfied MPs increase in the PP and decrease in thePSOE). Therefore, this deterioration of the views of the democratic working ofEU institutions among Spanish MPs belonging to opposition parties, expressesa deeper insatisfaction with the balance of power within the EU, which duringthe crisis has clearly turned to favour creditor countries. This is confirmed bythe significant increase in 2014 of the percentage of respondents who agreedwith the idea that EU decisions did not take into account the interests of Spain(27.2% in 2009, 50% in 2014) (see below).Figure 2: Satisfaction with Democracy in the EU (percentages)60,0%50,0%40,0%30,0%20,0%10,0%0,0%Very dissatisfiedSomewhatdissatisfiedSomewhat satisfiedVery satisfied20092014Source: IntUne (2007 and 2009) and ENEC (2014) elite surveys.However, these criticisms have not influenced the high levels of support for EUintegration among Spanish MPs. Figure 3 confirms this assertion, since thedistribution of opinions concerning whether the EU integration process shouldbe strengthened or stopped, and the corresponding average scores (8.1 in 2007and 2009, 8.0 in 2014), have hardly changed during the crisis. Party identitymakes again a distinction here when explaining the distribution of opinions(average differences are not statistically significant): while 42,3% of PSOEMPs are totally in favour (a score of 10 in a 0-10 scale) of strengthening theEU, most of the conservatives parliamentarians express different degrees ofmoderate support to this political view, with only 15% totally in favour.HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 224Figure 3: Support for the Strengthening of EU45%40%35%30%25%20%15%10%5%0%3456789102007 2009 2014Note: Figures represent the proportion of MPs who situate themselves in a particular pointwithin 0-10 scale, where 0 means 'EU integration has gone too far' and 10 'EU integrationshould be strengthened'.Source: IntUne (2007 and 2009) and ENEC (2014) elite surveys.4.3The Cognitive-Evaluative Dimension: The Scope of EUGovernanceThe evolution of MPs’ attitudes regarding the scope of governance that shouldbe developed in the EU does not differ substantially from what has been ob-served for the emotive dimension in the previous section. The main trend iscontinuity, although some slight changes along these years suggest again therelevance of the influence of the party competition. For the vast majority of theSpanish parliamentary elite (Figure 4), the EC must become the true govern-ment of Europe (86.6%), while the powers of the EP should be strengthened(85.9%) as well as those of the European Central Bank (ECB) (71.1%). Re-flecting a paradoxical position, an important proportion of respondents alsosupports the idea that states should remain central actors of the EU (65,5%).This contradictory position actually suggests an interesting evolution since thebeginning of the crisis. Indeed, while in 2007 the support to a more parliamen-tarian view of the European Union seemed to predominate (with 25 points ofdifferences between support to strengthen the EP powers and declaring thatstates should keep their central position in the European governance), the fi-nancial crisis has encouraged the support for a more executive view of thegovernance (based on the role of the EC) to the detriment of the role of states,HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 225with more than 20 points of difference between both statements (Figure 4). Inthis vein, it is interesting that the support for the ECB role7 is stronger than forthe role of the member states. In contrast with these opinions, the support to theemployment of referendum to be used as a tool to take most important EUdecisions is much weaker (52.6%). It does not seem that the consequences ofthe financial crisis could have altered the view in favour of direct democracy atthe European level. Overall, there is a prevailing view amongst Spanish politi-cal elites in favour of a state-like democracy for Europe, supported by the88.6% of the respondents.Figure 4: Agreement About EU Governance Issues (percentages)10090807060504030201002007 2009Member states should remain the central actors of the EU2014European Commission should become the true government of the EUPowers of the European Parliament should be strengthenedPowers of the ECB should be strengthenedMost important decisions should be taken through a EU referendumEU level decisions do not take the interests of my countryInterest of some countries carry too much weight in EU decisionsSource: IntUne (2007 and 2009) and ENEC (2014) elite surveys.Party affiliation also influences decisively the views about which institutionsshould be strengthened. While almost half of the PSOE MPs disagree with theidea of keeping the states as central actors of the EU decision-making (46.2%),only a minor fraction of the PP group (12.5%) does not agree. On the contrary,PP representatives are less convinced than those of the PSOE about the idea ofstrengthening the EP powers (75.6% vs 96.2%). Similarly, two thirds of thePSOE group (66.7%, and all the other left-wing MPs in the chamber) agrees in7 This item was not included in the IntUne surveys.HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 226that the most important decisions concerning the EU should be taken by amajority of all European citizens. In contrast, only 30.8% (most of them agree-ing somewhat) of the PP representatives agrees in this democratic approach.In contrast, the Eurozone crisis has clearly fuelled criticism regarding therole of states’ interest in the EU’s decision-making processes (Figure 4). In-deed, the amount of respondents arguing that the EU level decisions do notusually take Spain’s interest into account has expanded during the observedperiod, increasing from 17.1% (in 2007) to 49.4% (in 2014). This is congruentwith the strong view, shared by almost all the MPs, of the idea that the interestof some countries carries too much weight in the EU (supported by 93.8% in2014). Overall, this is an indicator of how Spanish elites have perceived theerosion of the position of the country (as well as other Southern Europeancountries) in the EU compared to the central role of the richest countries.Figure 5: Alternatives to Cope with the Financial Crisis in the EU (percentagesof agreement)9080706050403020100Intervention byinternationalfinancial institutionsIntervention by the Coordinated action Autonomous actionEU by national by nationalgovernments governments20092014Source: IntUne (2009) and ENEC (2014) elite surveys.The financial crisis forced the EU and their state members to take action to dealwith the economic consequences of the crisis. The experience during this peri-od may have affected opinions about how the EU should approach such chal-lenges. On the one hand, there is a general consensus about need of EU finan-cial aid to countries in difficulty (backed by 96.3% of the MPs). On the otherhand, of the different alternatives to deal with the crisis in the EU, during theobserved period Spanish MPs have reinforced their opinion in favour of theintervention led by the EU, to the detriment of state actions or the role of inter-national institutions (Figure 5). Between 2009 and 2014, the support for anHSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 227intervention led by the EU increased (as a first or second choice amongst dif-ferent alternatives) from 52.6% to 73.8%. In contrast, the choice for coordinat-ed action by national governments decreased from 76.3% to 67.5%. This de-cline is mainly focused on those considering this option as their first choicecompared to the other alternatives (51,3% in 2009). Besides, the alternative ofan intervention by international financial institutions has lost credit, decreasing14 percentage points, while an autonomous action by national governments isthe last choice for most of the parliamentarians.These choices are somewhat influenced by party ideology, as PSOE MPsare less likely to back the 'states only' strategy compared to conservative repre-sentatives. In 2014, the autonomous action by national governments was pre-ferred as first or second choice by right-wing MPs (difference +24.4) as well ascoordinated action of national governments (difference +11.7), while left-wingMPs gave stronger support to the intervention by the EU (difference +20.2) andto the role of the international fiscal institutions (difference +13.8). Moreover,the effect of party ideology is particularly outstanding when the MPs come toassess the role of EU institutions in the management of the Eurozone crisis.While PP representatives give a positive assessment of the EU, the EC and theECB (around an average of 6.3 points on a scale 0-10), left-wing parliamentari-ans express a worst opinion (average below 4 points). Finally, the ideologicaldivide is more generally reflected in the MPs’ opinions about which should bethe main aim of the EU. For left-wing representatives, this should be to providebetter social security (83.9%), while conservative MPs conceive an EU focusedon either making the European economy more competitive (31.8%) or on botheconomic and social aims (40.9%).The scope of governance also deals with multilevel policymaking, i.e., thechanging relationship between actors situated at different territorial levels andhow policy issues should be allocated amongst them (Jerez-Mir et al. 2010,49). In this respect, the preferences of political elites tend to follow the generalpro-EU support pattern observed in previous pages, with some exceptions. Infact, while elites express more pro-EU positions in issues and policies dealingwith transnational problems, they are less conclusive in those policies tradi-tionally linked with domestic issues (Real-Dato et al. 2012; Real-Dato andAlarcón 2015). However, since 2009 there has been a an increase in the per-centages of those respondents who prefer issues to be dealt at the EU level. Wemay interpret this as a consequence of the failure of national and subnationalgovernments to respond to the main political challenges posed by the financialcrisis. This effect is general (but not necessarily homogenous) across all kind ofissues and policies, with two resulting patterns of evolution (see Figure 6).HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 228Figure 6: Preferred Policy-Making Level for these Issues (percentages)Fighting Unemployment Immigration8060402008060402008060402008060402008060402009080706050403020100EU levelEU + national/regional levelsNational/regional levelsBanking/ Finance Regulation(2014)200720092014EU levelEU + national/regional levelsNational/regional levelsEnvironment200720092014EU levelEU + national/regional levelsNational/regional levelsFight Against Crime200720092014200720092014EU levelEU + national/regional levelsNational/regional levelsHealth Care Policy200720092014EU levelEU + national/regional levelsNational/regional levelsSource: IntUne (2007 and 2009) and ENEC (2014) elite surveys.HSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 229In those issues where political elites where divided regarding which level ofpolicymaking should prevail (the EU, the national/regional level, or both),there has been an increasing gap in favour of the EU in immigration, environ-ment, and fight against crime. Besides, in those policy areas where the pre-ferred policymaking level was the nation or the region (fighting unemploymentand health care policy), there has been a decline in support for those levels ofgovernment parallel with an increasing preference for the intervention of theEU (alone or in coordination with the other levels). One particular case is bank-ing and finance regulation, where there is a strong consensus around the fun-damental role of the EU in this policy area (84%).In some policy issues, preferences regarding which level must prevail interms of policymaking are slightly affected by the party ideology (Real-Datoand Alarcón 2015). Therefore, left-wing MPs give stronger support to the EUlevel than the conservative representatives in issues like the unemploymentpolicy (difference +33.8%), environment (+20.2%) or crime (+19.6%), while inother issues party differences are less relevant or non-existing.Figure 7: Preferences in Military Policies: A National vs a European Army(percentages)6050403020100200720092014A national armyA EU armyBoth (national and EU army)Source: IntUne (2007 and 2009) and ENEC (2014) elite surveys.The main exception to this general trend to reinforce the preference for the EUas a central policymaking level is the security area, at least if we observe thedeclining support for a so-called European army (Figure 7). While in 2007 thepreferences in this aspect were clearly in favour of European military coordina-tion (with an EU army alone, or also in cooperation with national armies), onlyHSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 230seven years later the situation is much less clear, with divided opinionsamongst Spanish MPs. We might interpret these changes as a domestic reactiontowards the rise of new threats to the national security, particularly the destabi-lization of the Northern African countries, like Libya or Egypt, since the startof the Arab Spring, or the crisis in Ukraine, and the failure of the EU to providea unified strong response to these security issues. Party ideology might help toexplain partially how this evolution has influenced th<ref>e Spanish elite’s opinions.Even though the increase of the support for the national army is consistent inboth left and right, the preferences for either an EU army alone or for the coex-istence of armies (European and national) are substantively different alongparty lines: while the left-wing MPs are mostly in favour of a EU army com-pared to the conservatives (48% against 23.3%), the</ref>al army is consistent inboth left and right, the preferences for either an EU army alone or for the coex-istence of armies (European and national) are substantively different alongparty lines: while the left-wing MPs are mostly in favour of a EU army com-pared to the conservatives (48% against 23.3%), the development of a EU armyin cooperation with national armies is the preferred option for the conservativescompared to the socialdemocrats (48.8% against 20%).4.3The Projective-Conative Dimension: Perspectives on the Futureof the EUOur analysis of the conative dimension includes three aspects of how Spanishparliamentarians perceive the future of the European project and its institutions:which of the policies traditionally linked to the core of state sovereignty shouldbe fully Europeanized, which threats may endanger European integration, andhow MPs foresee the future of the EU in the long term. These attitudes areparticularly relevant to understand how the financial crisis and its consequencesmay have changed what elites expect from European integration. As Best,Lengyel and Verzichelli state, “the willingness to transfer control over im-portant policy areas to a supranational European level rests in a ‘progressive’perception of Europe’s destiny and future purpose” (2012, 9).Regarding the Europeanization of core sovereign policies (foreign policy,social security, and taxation), the financial crisis has had an impact in howSpanish politicians view the political evolution in these specific areas (Figure8). Generally, Spanish MPs’ preferences in most of these areas remain stablecompared with those in 2007 and 2009. It is the case of developing a singleforeign policy for all the EU members regarding non-EU states (48,1% stronglyin favour, 43,2% somewhat in favour), or setting a common social security forthe EU members (28,8% strongly in favour, 58,8% somewhat in favour). Thereare not obviously strong differences along party lines in these policies. But inthe taxation area, there has been a significant change during the observed peri-od. Therefore, if in 2007 the proportion of those in favour of a unified tax sys-tem was slightly below 75%, in 2014 such percentage increased up to a 85.6%(40.5% strongly in favour, 45.6% somewhat in favour, including almost allleft-wing MPs). In the same vein, there is a strong support for developing asystem of collectivising the national debt through the issuance of EurobondsHSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 231(39.5% strongly in favour, 53.9% somewhat in favour). In these policies, partylines make some slight differences in the intensity of preferences (strongly vssomewhat in favour) rather than between supporting or opposing the alterna-tives, being left-wing MPs those who show a more favourable position forcommon European policies.Figure 8: Policy Preferences in 10 Years (percentages)r-Eou sdbon 20142007lanoireg lep 2009e hroM 20142007ngire yfo ilc 2009leg opiSn 20142007ilacoCsoonmm irtscyeu 20092014tem 2007systxa 2009deiifn 2014U70%75%80%85%90%95%100%Strongly/somewhat in favourStrongly/somewhat againstNeither in favour or againstSource: IntUne (2007 and 2009) and ENEC (2014) elite surveys.There are also some signs of change in the perceived threats to the EU. In par-ticular, some threats have gained relevance since 2007. The more relevant isconnected to the financial crisis itself and its political consequences: two thirdsof the respondents think economic differences among states is a big threat tothe sustainability of the European project in its current form, while the corre-sponding percentage was only 42.1% in 2007. The economic effects of theHSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 232crisis may also spill over the political arena, in the form of the growth of na-tionalist and state-centred positions. Therefore, a 74.1% of the MPs consider abig threat that some countries put its national interest first, to the detriment ofthe collective view of the European project. This second indicator was alreadyhigh in 2009 (unfortunately, it was not included in the 2007 survey). This viewof economic inequalities and self-interested positions in states as threats to theEU is not corresponded when considering other issues. Therefore, only 39.2%of the interviewees considered the competition from the emerging countries asa threat; 25.6% thought the same about immigration from non EU countries,and 22.4% considered the enlargement of the EU to Turkey a likely danger.These positions clearly depend on the party affiliation of the respondent, withleft-wing representatives being mostly concerned with economic inequality,state self-interest and competition from emerging countries, while right-wingMPs were more likely to be concerned with the other issues.Conversely, almost all Spanish MPs dismiss the idea that the EU itself couldbecome a potential threat for the national culture and identity (only 2.5%agreed), welfare state (13.9%), economic growth (12.7%) or the quality ofdemocracy (4.9%).Figure 9: EU Long-Term Perspectives: In 10 Years (percentages)9080706050403020100EU will bemoreintegratedEU economywill be morerobusteconomic differencesdifferences btw citizensbtw members within stateswill be lower will be lowerEU as ageopoliticalpower willincreaseimportanceYesNoDo notknow/do notanswerSource: ENEC (2014) elite surveys.Finally, Figure 9 shows the results concerning the views of Spanish MPs aboutthe future general situation of the EU in 10 years. Opinions among SpanishMPs are definitely optimistic, though levels of optimism differ depending onthe aspect of the future in consideration. Thus, while about 85% percent ofrespondents were confident that in 10 years the EU will be politically moreintegrated and its economy will be more robust, this percentages was lowerHSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 233when considering the future of the EU as a geopolitical power or that differ-ences between citizens (60.3% and 68.4%, respectively, were optimistic aboutthese issues).5.Conclusion: Stability in the Europeanness of SpanishParliamentary Elite during the CrisisThis article has offered an overview of several aspects of the Spanish politicalelite’s attitudes towards the EU. We have employed the multidimensionalconcept of Europeanness to integrate these views into a common comparativeanalytical framework. The main results confirm that the longstanding pro-European consensus among Spanish national representatives (Jerez-Mir et al.2015b) has remained almost unalterable after the harsh period of financialcrisis and political turbulence. And in those few cases where significant chang-es in the main patterns of perceptions and expectations are detected, thesechanges usually reveal a strengthening of the support to for a more federalistview of the European project. Therefore, in 2014 the average level of trust inthe EP among Spanish MPs was significantly higher than in 2009. Similarly,the percentages of respondents who prefer that key policy areas of contempo-rary governance, particularly those that are at the core of the current Europeandebate such as taxation, finance, immigration, and environment, are decidedexclusively by EU institutions increased in 2014 with respect to 2009. Besides,this has also become the preferred alternative for a key policy area in the do-mestic arena such as fighting unemployment. In contrast, one of the more rele-vant changes comparing to previous results (in the 2007-2009 IntUne projectdata) is the deterioration of the support to the national/regional level of gov-ernment as crucial reference points for decision-making (in contrast to whatwas observed by Jerez-Mir et al. 2010, 51). However, some negative percep-tions have gained relevance during the last years, related to the perception thatEuropean decision-makers or the decision structure of the EU do not takeenough into account the interests of those countries, such as Spain, more af-fected by the crisis, while the view that some countries carry too much weighton EU decision making still persists. This is in line with the perception ofmember states' self-interest and economic inequalities as the most importantthreats to European integration.The pro-EU positions among Spanish MPs is also evidenced when lookingat their views of the future of the EU in 10 years, where a great majority be-lieves Europe will be more integrated and prosperous; and the minority repre-sented by those who think the EU constitutes a danger for the country's cultur-al, economic or political systems.This Euro-optimism of the Spanish parliamentary elite may also have lesspositive reading if we look at it from the perspective of the representative roleHSR 41 (2016) 4 │ 234played by Spanish parliamentary elites. As we have explained in previouspages, this pro-EU consensus was built upon the stability of the representationof the main political parties (even though some changes in the parliamentarybalance between PSOE and PP). But this stability has run in parallel to a dete-rioration of some aspects of the (traditionally positive) attitudes of Spanishcitizens towards the EU. Such deterioration has affected mostly to the levels oftrust in EU institutions, support for European integration, or the benefits ob-tained from the EU membership (Real-Dato 2015). This differential evolutionof the views of citizens seems to be producing an increasing gap between theseand their political representatives. This gap might be partly caused by the cog-nitive differences between elites and the general public mentioned at the begin-ning of this article. But also, it could be an expression of what Peter Mair hascalled the dilemma between responsibility and responsiveness (2013, 140).According to this, the emphasis on responsibility by traditional parties to thedetriment of responsiveness to the electorate might open a growing dividebetween “parties which claim to represent, but don’t deliver, and those whichdeliver, but are no longer seen to represent” (Mair 2013, 141). Unsurprisingly,the increasing gap between the positions of Euro-optimistic political elites andEuro-critical citizens has developed during a time when both PSOE and PPgovernments implemented very unpopular austerity policies. In this context,parties' emphasis on responsibility may have eroded the popular basis of thepermissive consensus that has prevailed in Spain since its entry in the EEC in1986. It could also be argued that the persistence of this gap between partiesand citizens could pave the way for new parties or political actors thriving onpopular disatisfaction with the economic and political situation and with anationalist or even Eurosceptic agenda. This might help to understand the elec-toral breakthrough of a new party like Podemos in the 2014 European election,which based its campaign in exploiting a highly critical discourse with thepolitical class and the austerity policies imposed by the EU, and claiming thereinforcement of the role of the national institutions in Europe (Rodríguez-Teruel et al. 2016). This raises interesting prospects about the implications ofparty system change in Spain for the European project. Will the new MPs com-ing from the new parties – mostly from Podemos – accommodate to traditionalpatterns of Europeanness? Or will they transform them aiming to respond todissatisfied voters if the EU’s output-oriented legitimacy continues to deterio-rate?ReferencesAlonso, Sonia. 2013.
