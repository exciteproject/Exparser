This practice of nursing can be seen as a social being exercised by professionals on theobject of your doing, by who establish relationships, applying their knowledge as a way to transform aconcrete reality.1From this perspective, theories are built from concepts, models, propositions serve as abasis to support practical actions, assisting and explaining the approaches taken by the work object -the human being. In nursing, the body of the human being, the person suffering physical,psychological, social and spiritual, can be understood as the object in which it performs the task ofprofessional nursing. This task it is the therapeutic care, which is set in action, which develops andcompletes with the human being, value-laden ethical and a necessary good people.2To understand the formation of theoretical nursing, it briefly redeems some historical eventsof the constitution of the profession. The nursing for many years, described its procedures, fromclinical practice to the first decades of the twentieth century, systematize them as first organizedform of knowledge, subsequently, by the institution of the scientific principles that underlie. Andmore recently, in the 1950s and 1960s, the concern focused on reflecting more deeply about theprofession, its object of study and the theoretical framework relevant to care, when then began tobe built nursing theories.3Theories hold a reciprocal relationship with the nursing actions and jointly exercising dailywork is the therapeutic care, as epistemological object, which refers to the discipline of nursing, tostructuring their professional practice.4However, it's still observed in the literature scarcity of scientific theories about the nationalnursing. A study on the subject points out that only 4.6% of the publications used nursing theories of3757 articles, seven nursing journals, from 1998 to 2007.5The proposed consideration of theories focuses on nursing recognizing it as a discipline,profession and social practice, through the formalization of concepts and theories, as the properinstruments to direct the search for specificity of nursing, ie, limits of performance relative to otherprofessionals, own body of knowledge, autonomy, professional identity and visibility.6In this direction, the Theory of Professional Links (DVT) consists of a tool for nursing, whichaims to train, and continuously affirming interpersonal relationships in nursing team, as a unit group,in addition to the group of persons with potential for growth and strengthening the practices of care,through the establishment of healthy professional bonds. This theory, in essence, seeks to addressthe interpersonal relationships between nurses and staff, thereby establishing therapeuticrelationships more. Moreover, grasps the links with the development of group dynamics arising frommovements that take place in two spheres of relationships, institutional space and space-specificcare action, directing the action team to the exercise of therapeutic care.7Based on these, this paper it is a critical reflection about the importance of nursing theories,using DVT, as an example, to assert theories as instruments of labor, which formalize the actions ofthe nursing profession and, as a social practice, which builds daily.R. pesq.: cuid. fundam. online 2013. dec., 5(5):155-61156ISSN 2175-5361Porto AR, Thofehrn MB, Pai DD et al.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2013v5n5esp155Nursing theories and models…RREESSUULLTTSS AANNDD DDIISSCCUUSSSSIIOONNEpistemological context of nursingThe construction of knowledge in nursing is still in its initial phase; however, the designationof care is based on the principle of a practice that develops on the nurse-client interaction, with theintention of contributing to the welfare this in their daily lives. The watch is designed by manyscholars as an epistemological object of nursing because it involves humans in its complexity, which isthe focus of their work.4Progress can also be seen in the evolution of conceptions of the term "human being" and theparadigm shift in the management and attention paid to the needs of health. In the twentieth century,there was the assertion of the fragmentation of the human body and mind, from the biomedical modelthat produces the mechanism of making the individual's biological vision, expertise about the person'sbody, the appreciation of the technical procedures of the act physician and the emphasis on curativemedicine, which reinforce the division of the person into parts, making the union of these fragments,for an overview of the human being, especially considering besides the organic aspects, such as illness,other dimensions of human life- psychological, social, spiritual, economic, among others.Moreover, the biopsychosocial model of health care and management emerged as a way tomeet the shortcomings of the model history, such as the production of health in people with chronicdiseases, autoimmune cases without clinical diagnoses or difficult to solve . Still, compared to recentparadigm that other knowledge professionals now become necessary to complexity involving healthcare to people.9Nowadays, much of the demand for health services, in terms of workforce - professionals, isrelated to knowledge that go beyond the biomedical model approach, demanding greater coverage ofthe process of health and disease, with emphasis on policies health and operation of new modes ofcare. This question is linked to the fact that in recent decades there have been changes in clinical andepidemiological profile of the population, life expectancy, the economy and world politics, withconsequent restructuring of the health sector and pose new challenges to the professionals, who mustso articulate, organize to confront the problems that arise in different scenarios and actions thatimpact the health field and do nursing.10In this context, although the nursing care adopt as its object of activity, the profession stillsuffers the effects of the need to occupy positions of power and develop nurses as being socio-político.6 Moreover, this area deals with health permanent identity crisis, the lack of anepistemological and theoretical dependence of scientific practices in the field of health and otherareas.Thus, the question is: why not think about the epistemological object as therapeutic carenursing? Dare to conceive this as metaparadigm this field of knowledge and at the same time, nursinggrounded in epistemic structure multiparadigmatic, before the lack of professional identity and inaccordance with the needs of customer care.From this perspective, it is clear that the Brazilian nursing theories are still incomplete, oftenbeing disregarded and devalued in academic and professional spaces.These gaps reflect the corpus of nursing, in particular, within the pedagogical and healthcare,as these are an aspect conditional better understood in relation to theories and practices that onceR. pesq.: cuid. fundam. online 2013. dec., 5(5):155-61157ISSN 2175-5361Porto AR, Thofehrn MB, Pai DD et al.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2013v5n5esp155Nursing theories and models…imported, without being questioned, they became the majority, or hegemonic because measures weretaken as saviors of professional difficulties, accumulated from historical experiences of thinking andaction in nursing. In terms of scientific construction, there is a nursing losses undesirable lack ofpower, as knowledge areas face the pressures of health policies by regulators or the funding agenciesand research support.12In recent decades, the paradigm shifts in the field of health care and management areoccurring rapidly, since the construction of the social process, which has the most wins the right tohealth of millions of Brazilians, from a philosophical and conceptual basis derived in Sanitary Reformmovement, whose landmark the XVIII National Health Conference, held in 1986, which instituted itseminently interdisciplinary due to multiple measurements and historical mediations. Thus, those whohave concrete object as work health and disease in its social context cannot from a single discipline toguide their professional actions, because it involves both social relationships and social itself, theexpressions emotional, as well as the biological conditions and reasons socio-cultural and historicalindividuals and groups.Similarly, in the educational field, the new National Curriculum Guidelines provide animportant achievement in the field of nursing by pointing, as policy, the need to produce changes inthe training process, providing professionals more committed and engaged with the principles andguidelines of the Unified Health System (SUS). These efforts correspond to the concern of breakingdefinitively with the biological paradigm and medicalized, hospital-and procedure-centered, meetingthe new challenges of contemporary knowledge production, the production of professions andestablishing healthy relationships in work teams.The link between education, work and social practices envisions a new perspective onsignificant transformation in the daily life of each professional involved with comprehensive care,especially when organized from the health needs of the population. So this is where nursing, as well asother health professions, needs greater engagement in defense of an argument more solid permeatedby assumptions Health Reform with a view to reviewing, in which lie the paradigm of current modelshealth care and what has been their role in this process, action that dispenses with the reorientationof their professional practice.13From this point of view, it should be noted that health work is highly relational, since its focusis human care cannot, as in other production models are cast in equipment or highly structuredknowledge, such as organizational technologies However, the meeting of subjectivities, incorporating asignificant degree of freedom in choosing the method of doing this production.14In this space often inconspicuous amid the daily routine of many health workers and thediscussion of the performance of an interdisciplinary manner, which focuses the importance of theoriesin the construction of specific core of knowledge, social practice and consolidation limits nursingactivities, by their epistemological possibility in therapeutic care and ethics in dealing withprofessional issues.11Theory of professional connections: strengthening practiceFront exposed to discussion about the epistemological construction of nursing, given thechanges (multi) paradigmatic healthcare, presents itself as an alternative, the Theory of ProfessionalLinks (DVT), seeking to strengthen professional practice in meeting intersubjectivities of subjects,which act in everyday life on the same team.R. pesq.: cuid. fundam. online 2013. dec., 5(5):155-61158ISSN 2175-5361Porto AR, Thofehrn MB, Pai DD et al.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2013v5n5esp155Nursing theories and models…Thus, the scope of the potential of teamwork may be valued at the time at which individualsrecognize themselves as members of a group with a common goal. Thus, team members may feelresponsible, both for its failures as its successes, participating in decision making and particularlydescribing the communication of essential information to nursing work.Team work can be understood as "a network of relationships between people, power,knowledge, emotions, desires and interests, it is possible to identify group processes, where teamworkequals to relate."15:264Accordingly, DVT aims to provide nurses a model of teamwork in nursing, which promotesinterpersonal relationships, ie professional ties to the scope object epistemological nursing - caretherapeutic, committed people who need care health services. Furthermore, it allows theestablishment of greater inclusion and significance of the group in the institution, and also reinforcesthe very identity of the nurse as leader, ie, team coordinator and the planning of their activities.The basic assumptions of this theory are based on a philosophical look at historical anddialectical materialism, in which the bonds have a professional nature expressed in action and speech.That is, the bonds between humans are determined by the totality of the person through theirrelationship internal and external reflected through their actions and their words, not a part of it,because the worker must not separate his inner life of its externality, since the extent that the bondsformed professional group acquires a personality, an identity, determining your viewing and valuingthe institution.In addressing the relational skills of the management process in nursing, DVT has several setsof concepts, especially with regard to the subject of the theory, the nurse and the tool mediatesbetween the nurses and the other staff members, technicians and assistants nursing and communityhealth workers, ie, the model for teamwork in nursing. The goal of this proposal is focused on therelational and managerial actions of the nurse as a mediator in the process of establishment ofProfessional Links.The theory of knowledge is a process, because it includes the process of working in nursingand nurse-staff interaction in group dynamics. It is a suggestion with a high level of adaptation to thereality of the group, but is constructed by the operational method, and presents strategies forimplementation of the theory in a clear and practical, requiring the trader is scientific knowledge,sensitivity, creativity, imagination and skills to execute them.CCOONNCCLLUUSSIIOONNThis reflection-critique that focused on the importance of nursing theories to strengthen theprofession of nursing and social practice to inter-relate the context of nursing knowledge, DVT standsas a model to be experienced in daily care in order to qualify the relationship at work. It is, however,a flexible and adaptable to reality and creativity of nurses.Based on the theoretical models it is believed that nursing could provide their professionalidentity and body of knowledge, more broadly, including subsidies brought there by DVT relationalissues that mark with a lot of intensity do nursing. This, in turn, while at the same time, requiringsystematic routine operations, mechanized interventions should refuse, since its object of study is thehuman being in its uniqueness and subjectivity, thus requiring the humanization of related viewstherapeutic care.R. pesq.: cuid. fundam. online 2013. dec., 5(5):155-61159ISSN 2175-5361Porto AR, Thofehrn MB, Pai DD et al.DOI: 10.9789/2175-5361.2013v5n5esp155Nursing theories and models…Alert to the need for discussion on the construction of nursing knowledge and reinforces thesuggestion of some researchers, that the epistemological object of nursing, should be careful.
