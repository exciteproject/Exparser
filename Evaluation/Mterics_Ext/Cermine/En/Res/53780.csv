The paper debates the concepts of spaceand place in relation to westernization as a form of universalism. It shows how universalism is linkedto space with no respect for diverse cultures according to geographical origins as the case is forlocalism which is rooted in place. It analyses the United States’ pursuit for market unity, a strategywhich is propagated but with the ill intentions of maintaining her international superiority. The marketunity project is indeed, an enemy of democracy and a threat to not only cultural diversity, but also toall life on earth. In this paper I therefore suggest that, contrary to the critics, difference and thehorizontal structure of the Occupy Wall Street movement is advantageous. The fact that people areorganizing in protests in spite of their diverse cultures is, of course, an act of solidarity and unity. Bythis they demonstrate their belief that a better world is possible and that valuing cultural diversity anddifference is a prerequisite for coexistence and peace. Therefore, the main focus of this paper is todefend difference and diversity against world unity or totality or sameness.Keywords: Unity; space and place; western universalism; localism; world unity and peace; culture;enlightenment; United States1. INTRODUCTIONThis paper is divided into three main parts. In the first part I will briefly discuss the ideaof unity, from the time of the Enlightenment to the present age. The Enlightenmentconception of unity led to a perversion of human nature that elevated human reason overhuman emotion, and eventually led to a narrow understanding of the world, and the belief thatscience could guarantee peace. Reason, it was believed, would eventually unify all knowledgeinto absolute truth, which could be spread everywhere on earth.I will also talk about the concepts of space and place in relation to Westernization aform of universalism. I hope to show how universalism is connected to space and has norespect for different cultures, and no longer has any geographical origin, whereas localism isrooted in place. In place-centered worldviews context is of the utmost importance anddifference is respected. Also, the origins are clear and connected to geographical locations.This is an open access article under the CC-BY 4.0 license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)International Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 109The second part of this essay consists of a summary and analysis of the United Statespursuit for market unity as a way to maintain international superiority. This was used as ameans for keeping peace and containing the Soviet Union during the Cold War. However, wewill see that this project of market unity is, indeed, an enemy of democracy and a threat to,not only cultural diversity, but also, all life on earth.In the concluding part of this essay I point to encouraging signs of emerging socialmovements that are motivated by disdain for the status quo and the unity of the marketsystem. I suggest, contrary to the critics, that difference and the horizontal structure of theOccupy Wall Street movement is advantageous. The fact that people are organizing in protestis, of course, an act of solidarity. One could even describe it as unity. The protesters areunified only inasmuch as they oppose market unity. They believe that a better world ispossible, that alternatives exist, and that valuing cultural diversity and difference is aprerequisite for coexistence and peace.Diversity, after all, is a fundamental feature of life, but respect for and acceptance ofdiversity by itself is not enough. It merely provides a basis for the negotiation of truths, whichcan end in dynamic hybridity where place and context are respected while beingsimultaneously conscious of what is going on in the space arena. Far from advocating forisolationism, the main focus of this essay is aimed at defending difference and diversityagainst world unity, and what Emmanuel Levinas calls totality or sameness (Morgan, 2007).Levinas believed that “Western philosophy has been totalizing” because of its preoccupationin discovering an ultimate Truth believed to unify everything (Morgan, 2007, 95). Hence,Western philosophy has devalued difference and has resulted in what Levinas refers to as “thetriumph of the Same” (Morgan, 2007, 97).2. UNIVERSALISM: A WESTERN PROJECTThe Western utopian project of the Enlightenment was based on the idea that theunification of human knowledge and the advancement of science would eventually liberatemankind and ultimately lead to a more peaceful, rational world. All social phenomena andconflicts in life, it was believed, could be rationally understood, and thereby, solved (Dietrichand Sutzl, 2006). From this linear perspective, Europe was seen as the epicenter of progressand civilization.Human reason became a deity to be worshiped, and in many ways, it took the place ofChristianity as the central way of interpreting reality. Human emotion, on the other hand, wasrelegated as the lower nature and devalued as irrational being associated with nature andfemininity. The Enlightenment quest of attaining universal truth is the foundation ofmodernity, which is “characterized by Newtonian physics, Cartesian reductionism, the nationstate of Thomas Hobbes, and the capitalist world system” (Dietrich and Sutzl, 2006, 283).Wolfgang Sachs, makes a fascinating distinction between space and place in order tofacilitate our understanding of how both universalism and localism function in the world.Because universalism has “shed all vestiges of its particular origin, place and context, itbelongs nowhere and can therefore penetrate everywhere” (Sachs, 2006, 219). Hence, modernuniversalism a product of the Enlightenment is a hegemonic project that makes absolute truthclaims for all cultures of the world and measures civilization in relation to its own narrowconception of reality.Localism, however, is rooted in place. In other words, it is connected to culturesconsisting of “particular peoples, memories and cosmologies.” Human experience is10Volume 10connected to specific geographical places. Relationships, too, are intimately related to place.When speaking of place, the context is respected. Furthermore, it is important to point out that“place is not just the intersection of two lines on a map, but a concentration of meaningfulhuman activity which gives it a distinct quality, a distinct aura” (Sachs, 2006, 221).Space-centered universal values have been reinvented and reformulated in various waysthroughout history. The conquistadores and European settlers, for example, sought to spreadChristianity often violently throughout the Americas. The Belgian King Leopold II claimedthat his conquest of Africa was intended to civilize the savages, and the British Empiredefined its imperialist ambitions as the White Man’s Burden, which claimed a responsibilityof bringing Western civilization to so-called backward cultures and peoples (Dietrich andSutzl, 2006). All of this culminated in the modern concept of development, which, at its core,aims to spread the capitalist economic system characterized by an insatiable appetite for massproduction and industrialization. The capitalist system, which is a space-centered project,threatens all subsistent societies with “machine-driven, large-scale and standardizedprocesses” (Dietrich and Sutzl, 2006, 287).The impact of development on cultural and linguistic diversity has been devastating.“Along with languages, entire conceptions of what it means to be human have evaporatedduring the development decades since 1950. And yet, the death of languages is only the mostdramatic signal of the worldwide evaporation of cultures” (Sachs, 2006, 209). Sachs refers tothis destruction of diversity as the “homogenization of the world” (Sachs, 2006, 210). “Thehistory of the West is the history of the annihilation of countries and the extermination ofwhole peoples and cultures” (Duchrow and Hinkelammert, 2004, 71).The development period is marked by the peak of the linear belief that all cultures ofthe world are on the same historical path, headed in the same direction. This ideology isexpressed in the UN Charter (Sachs, 2006). Tragically, in order to unify mankind by means ofdevelopment, people had to be “disembedded from their stories of the past, disconnected fromthe context of their places, and detached from the bonds of their communities” (Sachs, 2006,211).3. THE UNITED STATES AND MARKET UNITYFollowing World War II, the United States found itself as the major victor of the war(along with the Soviet Union) and commenced to rebuild the world in its own image.Globalization and unity of the market was viewed, by those in power in the U.S. government,as the best and only way to maintain the superiority of the U.S. and achieve peace in theworld. When the Cold War began the U.S. government quickly created the either/or narrativeof good capitalist versus evil communist. This served Washington’s hegemonic aspirationsperfectly. It gave the U.S. a pretext for invading, occupying, and meddling in the affairs ofother countries around the world, as well as dividing the globe into allies and enemies. Ofcourse, the allies were always conveniently defined by Washington as those states thatadhered to capitalist market principles. Since the end of World War II the driving forcebehind Westernization and the so-called civilizing process has undeniably been the U.S.A new form of imperialism was born with its main objective being the pursuit ofglobal market unity (Sachs, 2006). The traditional way of exercising domination over otherswas recast and disguised in the deceptive altruistic albeit ethnocentric language ofdevelopment. Truman stated in his inaugural address that “the United States is pre-eminentamong nations in the development of industrial and scientific techniques.” (Truman, 1949).International Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 1011And so it was narrowly assumed that the United States was the most advanced civilization,possessing the one truth, with a moral responsibility of helping the rest of the world toindustrialize, particularly those cultures outside of the capitalist system with different ways ofbeing and relating to the world. Difference continues to be seen as an obstacle to developmentand world economic unity. It has been noted that “the neo-liberal ideology of the absolutemarket is presented as the only option, and all movements that resists it and its attendantinjustices must therefore be opposed” (Duchrow and Hinkelammert).Sachs points out that this project for economic unity has actually become an oppressiveforce to governments all over the world (Sachs, 2006). It is precisely this type of economiccompetition that prevents countries from tackling more pressing problems, such as, loomingenvironmental catastrophes and pollution caused by capitalist production.Duchrow and Hinkelammert give a dire assessment of the effects of market unity:The globalization of the market means that the nation-state has less and lesspower to intervene in economic policy when social considerations dictate.Instead capital employs every conceivable means to drive profits ever higher,without any consideration for people and the environment, and in this wayevades the constitutional obligation to sustain life (Duchrow and Hinkelammert,2004, 91).“Not to lose ground in the economic arena has become an obsession which dominates politicsdown to the local level” (Sachs, 2006, 215). The world market has become, as Sachs calls it, adespotic dictator that dominates both rich and poor countries (Sachs, 2006, 215). Thus, thequest for unifying all cultures into one Western overarching capitalist system has become athreat to everyone everywhere, even to those who exercise power within the capitalist system.The conquest of foreign markets trumped the conquest of foreign territories (Sachs,2006). Yet, the impact has been just as brutal and devastating to the conquered localpopulations. As the capitalist system forces different cultures to conform to Westernconsumerism in its quest for market unity, it marches towards an impending abyss, facing theannihilation of all life on earth with the collapse of the ecosystem. Outrageously, the originalsin, namely global unity, is now being touted as the only solution to the advancing threat tothe environment. Again, the unity discourse has been recast, not to spread Westerncivilization, but to save it (Sachs, 2006). The market has connected the world in such a waythat individual actions in one place may harm others living in a different place. We are nowliving in a time where people are linked together by “their shared dependence on biophysicallife-support systems” (Sachs, 2006). Therefore, saving the planet from environmental globaldestruction has increasingly become a national security objective for many countries. Sachswrites, “Can you imagine a more powerful motive for forcing the world into line than that ofsaving the planet?” (Sachs, 2006).Even before the attacks of September 11th, the United States was already obsessed withnational security. Westernizing other cultures and those deemed as different is one of thestrategies employed by Washington to mitigate hostility toward the United States and thecapitalist system that it is built upon. Andrew J. Bacevich argues that after World War IIWashington believed that global responsibility fell upon the United States and “the UnitedStates alone to lead, save, liberate, and ultimately transform the world” (Bacevich, 2010, 12).The U.S. global war on terror is being used (like the Cold War) to justify its neoliberaldevelopment policies and interference in other states’ politics. This has led the U.S.government to continue and even expand its support for antidemocratic policies in othercountries. The unity of the global market has always been the actual objective of the U.S.government and its capitalist partners. Using democratic language has merely served to12Volume 10further U.S. imperialist ambitions of global market unity, not advance democracy. Universaldemocracy has never been the real goal of U.S. foreign policy because democracy entailsallowing people to choose their own destinies and respects the autonomy of different cultures.As other countries around the world industrialize and grow economically, particularlyBrazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS), the U.S. and other Westerneconomies feel immense pressure to compete economically. Despite the remarkable economicgrowth of China, for example, it is still marked by many internal problems. “Though Chinamay have one of the world’s fastest-growing economies it has also become one of its mostunequal societies” (Harvey, 2005, 142).Democratic and labor rights are extremely weak in China, and in many cases simplynonexistent. The lack of workplace regulations has enabled businesses (including Westerncorporations) to make obscene profits at workers’ expense. David Harvey, writing about aform of neoliberalism with Chinese characteristics, notes that “wage levels in China areextremely low, and conditions of labour are sufficiently unregulated, despotic, andexploitative…” (Harvey, 2005, 148).Yet, China has created an attractive business climate for international corporations.And since China is not a democracy it is able to make economic decisions almost by decreerather than debating issues for months and ending in a deadlock with nothing accomplished,as it happens in the U.S. In short, capitalism in China is proving to be more efficient andprofitable an economic model to be emulated. The American pursuit of reshaping the world inits image specifically by unifying the market is now threatening to eliminate democratic andworkers’ rights (achieved through class struggle) still remaining in the U.S. “The success ofChinese communist-run capitalism is an ominous sign that the marriage between capitalismand democracy is approaching a divorce” (Zizek, 2011).The perceived limitation of democracy in contributing to economic growth has surelybeen noticed by the U.S. government and the corporate elites who wield power over it. As aconsequence, politicians in the U.S. are attempting to strip away workers’ rights and allregulations that may hinder the profits of giant corporations. Charles and David Koch thefourth richest Americans have “promoted their free market ideology and business intereststhrough aggressive lobbying in Washington DC, and financial support of political candidates”(Abeshouse, 2011). Furthermore, the Koch brothers are infamous for their support andfunding of the Tea Party and rightwing organizations that oppose government at almost everylevel, except for protecting the profits of the super-rich. They see “virtually all regulation asinterference with the free market” (Abeshouse, 2011).The aim of the West, and particularly the U.S., is to unify all countries under a capitalisteconomic model; but now, as we are witnessing in the current economic crisis, all countrieswithin the Western capitalist tent are sharing in the pain and collapse of the capitalist system.A universal solution is susceptible to error and can potentially lead to universal suffering.This is precisely the danger of space-centered universalism. It puts all of its eggs into onebasket and gambles on the survival of life on earth.It may be noteworthy to mention that the economic crisis of 2008 did not have as muchof an effect on Muslim countries with Islamic financial institutions. Indonesia, for example,did not suffer economically like Western countries. “Islamic law prohibits the payment andcollection of interest.Transactions must be backed by real assets, and because risk is shared between the bankand the depositor, there is added incentive for the institutions to ensure deals are sound”(Williamson, 2009). Hence difference was the redeeming factor. This is just one of manyexamples of the failure of universalism as a dominant space-centered ideology.International Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 10134. CONCLUSIONThe impact of space-centered universalism, which was a product of the Enlightenment,has been devastating to cultures on every continent. The loss of indigenous wisdom,creativity, and different ways of relating to the world, have created a dangerous unity of oneabsolute truth, namely, the unity of global capitalism and the belief that Western civilizationis the best and only way to organize the world. Moreover, a multitude of languages thatenable unique varieties of human expression have been extinguished, never to be regained. Asother economies rise to rival the U.S., the universal virus of global capitalism the destroyer ofcultures forces those in power in the U.S. to deregulate industries and strip away democraticrights in order to keep up with its competitors in a race to the bottom.Despite this grim description of the hegemonic pursuit for unity, we may be comfortedby the recent emergence of social movements around the world that are discontent with thestatus quo. From the Arab Spring to the Los Indignados in Spain, and finally, to the OccupyWall Street movement in the U.S., people are demanding alternatives to the market-drivencapitalist system that has eradicated diversity, increased the income gap between the rich andpoor, and is devastating the ecosystem.The Occupy Wall Street Movement has been criticized for its lack of unity, leadership,and ability to clearly articulate specific demands. These critics, however, fail to understandthat difference is indeed strength. In other words, the protesters are being criticized for notbeing prescriptive, not having a universal solution already prepared. The discontent that ismanifested in these social movements is the result of the failure of Western universalism.People are not demanding just one way for all peoples and cultures of the world, they aredemanding different ways to globalization and market-driven capitalism.I am not suggesting that the protesters should not eventually make specific demands.On the contrary, the protesters are already unified insofar as they are demanding alternativesto universalism and the status quo. “Their basic message is: the taboo is broken; we do notlive in the best possible world; we are allowed, obliged even, to think about alternatives”(Zizek, 2011).The Occupy Wall Street movement has already had an impact on the political discoursein Washington D.C. Those politicians who initially criticized the Occupy Wall Streetmovement are now attempting to placate and hijack it for their own political advantage. “Inthe same way we get coffee without caffeine, beer without alcohol, ice-cream without fat,those in power will try to make the protests into a harmless moralistic gesture” (Zizek, 2011).The horizontal structure of the movement allows it to be leaderless and creates anegalitarian environment. This, I believe, is another important strength of the movement.Thus, the arrest or killing of a beloved charismatic leader (i.e., Martin Luther King, Jr.) willnot pacify the movement. It also leaves those in power, who wish to crush the movement,confused about how to stop it.I will conclude with this quote by the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek regarding theOccupy Wall Street protesters:They are dismissed as dreamers, but the true dreamers are those who thinkthings can go on indefinitely the way they are, just with some cosmetic changes.They are not dreamers; they are the awakening from a dream that is turning intoa nightmare. They are not destroying anything, but reacting to how the system isgradually destroying itself. We all know the classic scene from cartoons: the catreaches a precipice but goes on walking; it starts to fall only when it looks downand notices the abyss. The protesters are just reminding those in power to lookdown (Zizek, 2011).14ReferencesVolume 10<ref>[1] Abeshouse, Bob, The Koch Brothers - People & Power: Al Jazeera English.
