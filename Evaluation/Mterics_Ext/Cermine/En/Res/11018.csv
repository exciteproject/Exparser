Management andtrade unions present it as a radical innovation that calls into question theprinciples of the former Taylorist organisation on the one hand, and themeaning of production workers' work on the other hand. The workers Iinterviewed at Volkswagen in Hannover actually develop a different analysis ofthe new work organisation and of its outcome. Their original understandinginvalidates the appellation of "groupwork" itself. They strictly separate thegroup: singular form of first-line supervision based on a new normativeframework, and the work: the meaning of which has remained unchangeddespite the implementation of the new organisation.ZUSAMMENFASSUNGGruppenarbeit ist eine für die deutsche Automobilindustrie typische Form derArbeitsorganisation, die maßgeblich von Gewerkschaftsideen beeinflusstwurde.

At that time, "groupwork" was a union wordonly. It was part of the considerations arising from the project called"humanisation of work" (Humanisierung der Arbeit) initiated by the federal Statein 1974. "Groupwork" was far from notions such as profitability andcompetitiveness [IG Metall, 1980; Leminisky, 1980]. It was an alternativeproposal for better working conditions, through re-qualification of assembly linework, tasks enrichment and greater workers' autonomy. It gave rise to someexperiences which were rapidly abandoned, as in the motor assemblydepartment at Volkswagen in Wolfsburg [Granel, 1980].In 1990, the publication of the MIT study on world-wide car industry[Womack et al., op. cit.] induced a major turn in western car manufacturersrationalisation's strategy. This study strongly contributed to bring to light the"Japanese model" and to diffuse teamwork. The automation strategy wasreaching its limits. Facing the emergence of very efficient Japanese competitorsorganised in a completely different way regarding work, production or supplierrelations, western car assemblers started to re-think their rationalisation policy,inspired by the Japanese success.1At the beginning of the 1990s, German managers turned to the workscouncils and the IG Metall1 to negotiate plant agreements on "groupwork",considering now "groupwork" as a key element to restore competitiveness. Bydoing this, they appropriated a term they have been rejecting before, and theyassociated "groupwork" with rationalisation and profitability. As a formeralternative proposal to management projects, "groupwork" became the core ofmanagement initiatives regarding work organisation. One observes a reversedsituation. Management now seeks to mobilise workers' know-how, experienceand creativity to enhance firms' competitiveness. "Groupwork" marks "workers'come back" in management words and strategies. It also signals the collusion(and sometimes the confusion) between management and union projects.Work in Groups on the Assembly LineIn 1996, management and works council at Volkswagen Hanover decided togradually introduce "groupwork" in all departments. The negotiations' outcomeconducted to implement one of the most innovative forms in the German carindustry2. It meets what Gerst et al. [1995] call "self organised enhancedgroupwork". Workers are called together in groups composed of ten to fifteenpersons. They are collectively responsible for a portion of the line, are in chargeof distributing the tasks between the different jobs. They are incited to rotateamong jobs on a self-determined rhythm, so that each worker is able to occupyany job on the group's portion of the line. Each group elects a spokesman whois not paid for his function. He acts as an internal co-ordinator and representsthe group outside.Besides production, the group as a whole is responsible for materialprovisions, light maintenance, workplace tidiness, repairs on the product, qualitycontrol and tools, but also for planning holidays and overtime recovery. In orderto be able to face those new responsibilities, groups are weekly given an hourdevoted to group-meetings, during working time. Workers themselves settle theagenda, and may invite any "expert" (planning engineer, foreman, unionrepresentative) being in a position to help them on any question they decide toaddress. The most important instruction in a factory is still "never let the linestop". However, group-meetings cause the stopping of the lines in the middle ofthe day. As the works council insisted on the importance of group-meetings,management finally agreed to implement them, provided that this would notentail any production losses. As a consequence, daily productivity has been122IG Metall is the German metalworkers’ union.On groupwork's diversity within the German car industry, see for example:Bahnmüller, Salm, 1996; Gerst et al., 1995; Hollmann, Niemeyer, 1998;Jürgens, 1995 in Sandberg; Murakami, 1995.enhanced, so that the time devoted for group-meetings does not provoke thefall of the number of produced vehicles. The introduction of group-meeting hasthen been followed by an intensification of the work on the line."Groupwork" between Innovation and RecurrenceThis particular form of work organisation, strongly influenced by union's views,proposes compatibility between assembly line work and workers' initiative. Itquestions the traditional academic conception of assembly line work as anexecution of simple and repetitive tasks demanding no intellectual activity[Sainseaulieu, 1998:30], as an extremely fragmented work [Friedmann, 1964],or as a manual work bound by rates and technical constraints [Verret, 1999]. Bycalling "groupwork" the new organisational pattern and the re-distribution ofresponsibilities it is based on, management and union propose a newunderstanding of the category of work. According to them, the new organisationwould radically put an end to the former vision of production workers' labour andinitiate an original one, including manual work and administrativeresponsibilities, execution and planning.The introduction of "groupwork" however maintains a recurrentrationalisation policy and cost reduction strategy by intensifying production workand enhancing rates. The outcome of the negotiations on group-meetingsshows that the production volume is intangible. According to this point,"groupwork" only represents an adaptation of traditional rationalisationstrategies.Consequently, "groupwork" contains a tension between two poles. On theone hand, the re-distribution of responsibilities breaks with former forms of workorganisation: for the first time, management is giving workers the right to decideon certain points, and is socialising the decision-making process. On the otherhand, the impossible negotiation on production volume and the continuous risein rates reiterate usual forms of rationalisation."Groupwork", Group and Work in Workers' ViewWhat do workers think about this new organisation, which is regarded as asuccess by the union, supported by management, and considered by the twoparties as an innovation? How do they themselves analyse "groupwork"? Intheir opinion, does "groupwork" re-found the category of work? Do they developa new vision of factory workers since the introduction of "groupwork"?3I tried to answer those questions by conducting interviews with productionworkers and asking them what they themselves think about "groupwork"3. Bydoing this, I was not seeking to collect information from workers' side that couldvalidate or not my own hypothesis, but I was willing to get access to workers'opinion and statements on "groupwork". I considered workers as real interviewpartners, as interlocutors.In the following lines, I will focus on workers' understanding of "groupwork"by identifying the meaning workers give to "groupwork" only from their ownstatements. This is a specific anthropological enquiry framework, which materialonly consists of workers' words and assertions.I could resume workers' propositions with an apparently absurd sentence:everything has changed, everything is exactly as it used to be. In each of the 29interviews I conducted, workers' declarations on "groupwork" are built onparadoxical affirmations such as "it is better... but it has not changed anything"or "it is new... but we could already do that before". Workers' quotations areorganised as a network of successive oppositions, separations andconnections. By using simple words, that can be banal or surprising, workersdismantle and deny "groupwork's" mechanisms and principles. They not onlyhave their own vision of "groupwork", but also their own idea of work and therole of factory workers.Two cleavages organise workers' point of view. Workers dissociate"groupwork" from the period prior to the new organisation. They sometimesunderlie a fracture at the beginning of a new period, they also compare the neworganisation with the time before its implementation to soften "groupwork's"innovative character... and they also point to a fundamental continuity. Moreimportantly, contrary to the combination that "groupwork" contains, workers dodistinguish group and work and analyse these two words separately. These twocleavages can cross or part, and require the collection of successive clues fromthe anthropologist as well as from the reader.34I spent 7 weeks at Volkswagen in Hanover, in September and October1998. This time has been devoted to many commented visits of differentdepartments of the plants, to interviews with middle managers, engineers,foremen, unions representatives, and with production workers. Theinterviews with the workers were strictly confidential. They took place withinthe factory, during working time, and lasted an average of two hours. Theywere based on a precise questionnaire. These interviews have beenrecorded and then transcripted word for word. Céline Bocquillon has helpedwith the transcription.Work and Group-Meetings: "we do more every day,nothing has changed"We've been working the hours in advance for the group-meetings. The times we needfor group-meetings, we've been working them in advance.4This first quotation indicates, on the one hand that the substance of group-meetings has got nothing to do with work, and on the other hand, that meetings,or more precisely, their duration has a particular relationship to work. Meetinghours result from work, they have been earned by work.We work the entire week to get this group-meeting, because we have a little bit fastertempo because of that [...]. For this group-meeting, the 12 cars that get lost, we buildthem during the week after, so that it's not given to us in that sense, we're working forit.For the time we've been loosing today [for the group-meeting], we do a bit more everyday, nothing has changed, in my opinion, nothing has changed.Working for the meeting means producing during the week the vehicles that getlost because of the meeting, it means working at a higher speed. So that workrelates to a double reference: rates and production. The meeting itself is freefrom production and rates, its duration however is subject of a conversion inproduction volume. The meeting's "container" do not escape productionconstraint. It is absolutely hold in this constraint and transposed into workthrough rates increase.As a consequence, the implementation of group-meetings – the "content" ofwhich refers to singular5 principles distinct from the categories that identify work(see below) – affects the work, in the form of a raise in work's burden throughrates increase (we do a bit more). It does not break with the absolute primacy ofproduction in the factory: within the factory, each hour is equivalent to a certainproduction volume. Time is the expression of production within the factory(nothing has changed).45Italics are extracts from the interviews conducted with Volkswagen workers.Those are the exact words and expressions used by the workers. As Iprecisely work on words, I chose to keep the workers’ speech like I heard it,including possible language mistakes or grammatical errors.I chose "singular" to translate the French "singulier", as well as "singularity"for "singularité". Even in the French version, the words "singulier" or"singularité" are not used according to their regular understanding.Singulier/singular qualifies something unique, usually statements,principles, words and categories: that are subjective proposals, whichexceptional and distinctive characteristics have to be approached andidentified. Singular, as well as workers' awareness, subjectivity andintellectuality belong to the specific theoretical framework and vocabulary ofthe anthropology of subjective singularities I decided to work with. ForFrench versions, see Lazarus, 1996.5Some workers propose a discharge of the expression "to work for themeetings" and employ an unusual and surprising form, even in German: "weare working us the meetings"6.We are working us [the meetings] in advance.We are working us the group-meeting, because we got a little bit higher tempo duringthe 5 days of the week, precisely to get these 60 minutes of group-meeting.We are working us, because of its unusual form, puts worker in the middle ofthe relationship between work and meeting duration. On the one hand, workersdo realise the demanded effort to implement group-meeting without anyproduction loss. Rates increase signals an intensification of workers' own work.But on the other hand, workers do benefit from this additional effort and fromthe raise in productivity with one hour every week free of both production andrates for group-meetings. One can read we are working us group-meetings as:workers are working for workers. Workers then point out the originality of ratesincrease following upon the introduction of group-meetings, and specify it.Workers do work more, some of them even consider they benefit from thisadditional work via group-meetings. In their own words, nothing indicates, this ismodifying their own vision of work. They even declare that nothing haschanged. Nevertheless the expression working for group-meetings suggests anessential disjunction between work and meeting: meetings are no work. Thisrepresents the first clue, the starting point. I will then first examine what workerssay and think of the group, afterwards I will come back to their ownunderstanding of work.The Group and the Foreman:"these problems just happened tobecome ours"The only thing is that, if any problems happen, we don't mention it to the foreman, wedo that within the group now.For the foremen, these problems are over... for 15 years, if any worker wasn't able todo a job, [the foreman] had to see how to handle that, how to do, it was always hisconcern, he doesn't have this concern anymore, these problems just happened tobecome ours, I would say. The foreman may have other concerns, but we have tosettle these problems.Just like a double, the group substitutes the foreman since "groupwork" hasbeen introduced, and one word circulates from one to the other: the wordproblem. Independent from what it refers to, if problem is associated to foremanand is then transmitted, or if problem is associated to group and has to be66The original expression is: "Wir arbeiten uns das Gruppengespräch"solved, it is always the same problem. There is no innovation regarding whatproblem means, just a transfer (these problems just happen to become ours).The group itself is responsible for quality, parts, duration of breakdowns, andresponsible for spare parts and those kind of things.The problems and responsibilities the groups now have to face are methodicallylisted. They are always technical ones and relate to the daily management ofthe production process.The group can be identified as a new form of "first-line supervision"7. Workersnow have to face the responsibility to manage daily production on the shopfloorthemselves and to fulfil production goals fixed by the firm. Comparingresponsibilities and goals given to the new first-line supervision with the formerorganisation there is no innovation. It only consists in the transfer of thesupervising function formerly exercised by the foremen to groups of workers.As well as the foreman used to be one in the former period, the group is adecision-taking authority.We can decide our work ourselves, we don't have to ask the foreman before: are weallowed to transfer this job here? But we simply do it, it's a resolution of the group andthat's it, of course it has to be voted, so that it's really a resolution of the group, it'swritten in the group's book, but without this resolution it doesn't work.Before the introduction of "groupwork", to have to, to ask, to be allowed toidentify the relationship with the foreman, that was characterised by submissionand subordination. Group, on the other hand, is referred to decide, do,resolution. To decide is not completely hold in what has to be decided, but alsoconcerns the decision about how to decide. It means that the group itselfdetermines the principles of its decision-making process. The vote and theresolution of the group identify a singular decision-making pattern based on theexamination of different opinions.Yes, we are a group now, and now... we have to manage, now we have to build carsproperly on our own, well, before if anything happened, we spoke to the foreman, andnow it's within the group and during group-meetings, we discuss about it, and alsowhen we can do it, we correct it, when we have problems, but we can't fix everything,we try.The group is a debating place (we discuss). Workers speak and exchangewithin the group. There is no unique solution but several conceivable solutions7Under "first-line supervision", I understand the responsibility the foremanhad to face before, that is distributing men and tasks among the jobs,controlling work's execution, providing material, planning holidays andtraining... so that the qualitative and quantitative production program fixedby management can be properly carried out [Labit, 1998]. There are stillforemen in the factory, but their role and function have undergone majorchanges within the ten past years.7to the problems that the group has to settle. Discussion testifies the variety ofpossible solutions, the diverse opinions and refers to the determination toexplore them.In accordance with the transfer of the role and function of the foremen tothe groups, the group is a decision-taking authority. The singular form of thedecision-making, however, differs from the way the foreman used to decidebefore: the group is a deliberative authority. Workers actually oppose group toforeman and show the specificity of the worker-group relationship based ondiscussion, contrasting with the worker-foreman relationship based oncommandment. The previous system was a hierarchical one, the foreman wasthe only one who could give his opinion, workers were formally in charge ofexecuting his orders, there was no interlocution. Within the new system,workers can speak, and talk to each other, they are responsible for determiningthe rules about how to manage the production on the shopfloor. Discussion isthe word specifying the originality of the new form of first-line supervision.To discuss, to find a solution: the meeting represents the support as well asthe necessary condition for the new first-line supervision to fulfil its obligations.If we have a problem, we can expose it properly during group-meeting, discuss, find asolution [...], I find it great.[During group-meetings] we talk about issues, we don't have time to talk aboutotherwise. During the breaks, we just switch off during the breaks, we read, or webring a book or anything else. We don't feel like talking about work... and we do thishere, during group-meetings we can do that, during the work itself, we don't succeed[in talking] either, it's loud out there, and we always have something to do, and if 5persons gather together and talk about anything, a supervisor comes to say: "don'tyou have anything else to do!" so that during group-meetings, we have theopportunity to settle those things, it's important.The group-meeting is the only occasion to talk and solve problems that thegroup now has to face. The new first-line supervision is the "content" of group-meetings. So that we have already solved a part of the enigma, namely specifythe substance of group-meetings: devoted to discussion and decision, thegroup-meeting is the place of the new first-line supervision.The Group on the Line: "we are forced to support our colleagues"I find it good, because groupwork, actually it means the works have to beaccomplished within the group and not by each individual. Before, it was this idea: "Igo to work now, I do my work and it's OK". Think another way means that the worksshould be accomplished within the group.Before, doing the work is referred to I, in a vis-à-vis. About the accomplishedwork, an explanation just had to be given to oneself – and formally to the8foreman – but nobody was forced to give any explanation to the other workers."Groupwork" has modified the rules, the group is now the frame and the "judge"of work (the works have to be accomplished within the group), this has to betaken into account (think another way).Within groupwork, everyone should try, not to work for himself but for the group.Everyone should be willing to help the others, or in my opinion, help the one that isnot really fit anymore, whose productivity is reduced. [...] We can't think each one onlyfor himself, but we have to think for the whole... If one of us doesn't accept it, it's backto the old relationship.The group initiates a new relationship among workers on the line. It is no morean individualistic relationship only referring to oneself (work for himself) but anopen relationship including the other workers and their abilities (help the onewhose productivity is reduced, think for the whole). This new attitude has to beshared by everybody, its original character specifically happens upon its sharingout (if one of us doesn't accept it, it's back to the old relationship). It is howevera fragile arrangement dependent on each worker's willingness to submit tocommon rules and to take care of the others (everyone should be willing).Well I find it good that we work in the group and that everyone has to participate, andthat there are not some persons anymore who can stay in the background as theyused to do, because they found an easier job or anything else.To have to participate is a new principle "groupwork" has inaugurated. Itdemands every worker of the group to contribute and to co-operate on the line.The group marks the end of reserved job, and leads to a more egalitariantreatment of workers. Workers consider this as positive.Not being able to stay in the background anymore, having to participate,think for the whole... the group is not only an authority that is deliberating anddeciding rules applicable to everyone, but also a control authority, supervisingthe execution of its decisions on the line. Beside discussion, the new first-linesupervision can be distinguished from the old one by two other essential issues.On the one hand, the application of group decisions on the line does depend inthe end on the commitment of each individual worker. Opposite to the foreman,the group has no formal sanction power towards its members8. On the otherhand, even if the group actually represents management on the shopfloor, andeven if it has to meet production goals, the group bases its collective rules on aconcern for other workers. Egalitarian treatment concerning job distribution,mutual aid, support, and the implementation of the new first-line supervision isbuilt on a certain solidarity compatible with the firm's objectives.8However, the group has informal sanction means at its disposal, such asrefusing to give holidays at the period asked by the one that doesn't committo collective rules. Not all groups use those informal sanctions (see note 8).9Workers declare that the singular relationship based on a mutual aid dutybegins with "groupwork". As a consequence we should deduce that the groupfounds an original solidarity and generates a new idea of workers' collective.But, a certain amount of other quotations deny the novelty of the neworganisation concerning this point and a few other ones.We have always been doing this: "it's exactly as it used to be"We've always been doing this! Yes, I work on a line where actually nobody never said"it's my job, I do my work, and the rest can manage", and I've never had this attitude.When someone just started, and had difficulties on his job, I helped him as much as Icould, I always cared, does he pull through or not? And on our line, it's always beenlike that, if somebody had an emergency, the other helped, it was always like this,one did this, the other did this also, it was one and the same... actually it didn’tchange so many things.The idea this worker has of the relationship among workers on the line has notchanged (this attitude). Mutual aid and support specify this relationshipaccording to which doing the work is not an individualistic concern one has forthe individual job he has been put on (it's my job, I do my work), but a largerconcern one has for the others and for the work the others have to perform (onedid this, the other did this also).As we work, we also worked like that before, that one supports another. Let's say,there were colleagues that did a work and didn't look to the right or to the left, andthere were also other ones that worked in collaboration, you can do your work on yourown for yourself, you can work together in collaboration.There is a possible multiplicity of the relationship to the others at work. Workcan refer to one's own in an individual relation, or work can refer to together andcollaboration, in a relation that takes the other workers on the line into account.However, this multiplicity is still valid today, as the use of the present tensetestifies it in the last part of the quotation (you can... you can...). As aconsequence, workers' relationship on the line is not determined by andsubordinated to an organisational framework, it is independent.Workers' solidarity identified by support, mutual aid and collaboration on theline is not induced by the introduction of "groupwork" but pre-exists it. Anddespite the group, it is still possible to escape group's pressure9.910Groups can be ruled along very different lines. Some groups haveintroduced no collective rules. Some other are governed by rules thatstrictly apply to every members. Another kind of group introduced collectiverules but apply them considering each individual situation. For example, if aworker wants to stay on the same job whereas the others rotate amongjobs, this can be allowed by the group, either temporary or for a long periodof time.If we compare the quotations we just examined, with the ones we analysedbefore (third paradox), we find a coherence and a tension. All those quotationsdo argue that worker's relationship specified by support and mutual aidparticularly characterises the actual relation among workers within the factory.But in the quotations claiming that this relationship begins with "groupwork", it isthen presented as a duty and an obligation: "we are forced to support ourcolleagues". Whereas in the quotations affirming that this relationship was priorto the group, it is identified as one possible relationship among others. Thedistinction between obligation and possibility identifies the gap separating"groupwork" with the period before its introduction.Before "groupwork", support, mutual aid and collaboration are the words ofsome workers. They only belong to workers, and refer to a certain solidarityintending to implement local justice on the line. As a consequence "groupwork"does not inaugurate workers' solidarity but marks its institutionalisation. So thatwhat was previously independently determined by workers, far from hierarchicalinfluence, becomes part of the normative framework of the new organisation.This framework consists in the affirmation and the implementation of new rulesthat can not be ignored.However, if solidarity is a norm or a possibility, if support and mutual aid arerelated to be forced to or to can, it does not modify what those words mean.Even if the collaboration on the line is identified as new rule, its effectiveimplementation still belongs essentially to each worker's attitude. According tothe workers, the group does not inaugurate a new vision of what worker meansfor them, it does not initiate a new solidarity within the factory, it does not modifythe vision of workers' collective.Group-meetings and the new first-line supervision are the only elements of"groupwork" to still be considered as innovating, at this point. But the followingquotations soften the originality of workers' own supervision.In principle it's not bad... but I think we could already do that before groupwork, thework was distributed indeed, but I learnt it like this, as I started here, we could say,you do this work, I do this other one, we could already say that... yes that's it... it's nota big difference, it's just called groupwork.The novelty that "groupwork" initiates does not refer to an absolutely newpossibility (we could already) but only to its name (it's just called groupwork).According to the old organisation, the foreman was formally in charge ofdistributing men and tasks among the jobs (the work was distributed), theimplementation of the rule however offered some room for manoeuvre that theworkers invested.We were also 8 colleagues on the line, at the beginning we were always doing eachone his job, but one day we said, why not a job further every day, so that we alsoworked in circle, today here, tomorrow there, because the works are not the same,11there's always one guy who can this job better, other works maybe worse, that's whywe said the best is every day a job further, and we always worked in circle, you mayhave a worse work today, but tomorrow you may have better, so that there is alwaysthis equilibrium (DC: When did you do this?) Since... it was for the T2, around 1981...We did that at once, ourselves, it came from us.Jobs are different, workers' capacities are unequal, above all the satisfaction isnot the same on each job (worse/better work). In order to compensate for theseinequalities, workers decided to implement job rotation, fifteen years before theofficial introduction of "groupwork". As a consequence, neither workers'initiatives, nor job rotation and workers' preoccupation for supervision issuesintending to achieve equity on the line have been initiated by the neworganisation in absolute terms.The initiative conducing to the implementation of job rotation actually restson the category of equilibrium, and intends to prevent some workers to bedisadvantaged on the long run because of a particularly unpleasant and difficultjob whereas others would be systematically advantaged. This initiative is basedon a conception of work according to which other workers and their ownfeelings about their work is essential.Regarding supervision, the innovation of "groupwork" rests on its formalimplementation. Despite the clear separation between workers' and foremen'srole imposed by the old organisation, some workers already felt concernedabout the daily management of production, and did not exclusively leave thistask to the foreman. The new organisation relies on those sporadic initiatives,extend them and give them the statute of a norm. "Groupwork" actually signifiesa rupture by formally constituting the group as a decision-taking authority, andby granting a weekly meeting to the group, so that it is able to fulfil itssupervision role.As they do it concerning solidarity, workers limit the innovation of"groupwork" to the rule that management and works council decree. Accordingto them, "groupwork's" novelty only refers to the new organisational andnormative framework. They deny this framework the ability to have any effecton their own subjectivity. The following quotation clearly presents this point:But it was exactly like that before, I mean, but it used to come from us, [...] it didn'tchange anything, it's the same thing, but now it's just ordered from above and beforeit came from the colleagues themselves.This does not mean however that workers do not take care of these new rules.They expose those rules' mechanism with a remarkable analytical precision anda detailed examination that show the attention workers have for these rules.They assume the new prerogatives: they meet, deliberate and decide. They arepretty satisfied, one of them even declares "it's great". Very few of them wish tocome back to the old organisation. But neither solidarity and justice on the line,12nor their own vision of worker, or their own idea of work (see below) have beenaffected by the new organisation."It's called 'groupwork', but in the end we work exactly as we used todo before"[Groupwork] is a good thing, a very good thing, yes because people are morerequired, but the work, the work on the product is the same, the indirect tasks, thishas become much more interesting what we have to organise ourselves, the indirectthings.Those from the top can say "now it's groupwork" or not, the only thing that comes ontop of this are group-meetings, but actually... I know what is always told aboutgroupwork... but in fact it's just this word, in the end the work remains the same, if it’swritten groupwork on it or not, it’s actually... nevertheless it remains because we haveour rates, our time instructions, our work.It's just like before, it's called precisely groupwork but in the end we work as we alsoused to work before, without 'first worker', but the work progress and all this, it has notchanged a lot, it's called groupwork, but if you look carefully, it's the same thing asbefore.These quotations illuminate the fundamental distinction between work and"groupwork". "Groupwork" is referred to organisational tasks, to group-meetings, to a change in the hierarchy on the shopfloor (without 'first worker'),that is to the new first-line supervision. Workers do not consider "groupwork" aswork, and according to them "groupwork" has no effect on work. Therefore, theexpression "groupwork" is even inadequate and designated as a simpleappellation (it's just this word), or rejected as strange to workers' vocabulary(those from the top can say "now it's groupwork"). The work is said to be thesame. Product, rates, work progress (decided by planning engineers, workprogress contains the description of the tasks and the time given to accomplishthem) identify, regarding work, what remains unchanged in spite of the neworganisation. Those are issues on which workers still do not have any influence.We have already seen, from the first paradox, that the new first-line supervisiondid not lead to any fundamental modification concerning time as the expressionof production within the factory. We should note that the foreman has neverbeen responsible for rates and for the speed of the line. As a consequence, it isnot amazing that the new first-line supervision, only based on the transfer of therole of the foreman to the group, does not lead to change this point.Even if work appears in a list, near rates, time instructions and workprogress, it is not reduced to those terms.I had to do my work, I can do it in a group or I can do it like before in an establishedrule [...] it hasn't changed a lot until now.13In my opinion, it's the same work, the same thing. For me it's exactly like before. Ialso have to do my work, in groupwork or differently.To have to do one's work like before splits with the new normative frameworkthat has been implemented by management and works council, and with theadvent of the group as a decision-taking authority. The foreman can decreearbitrary instructions, workers can deliberate about the best way to do the workbefore taking any decision, this is of no influence regarding the statement I haveto do my work. To have to do one's work like before proposes a subjectivationof the category of work supplanting concrete changes that occurred within thefactory: rise in rates, job rotation, questioned hierarchy, new organisation butalso the rule (in a group... in an established rule). This distance from the rule isprobably the most significant element. All along their remarks and even in thoseones, workers actually identify "groupwork" as a new set of rules.In those quotations, to have to only refers to I, as a self-requisitionconcerning work, absolutely heterogeneous and independent from the newformal rules in force within the factory. To have to do one's work is conjugatedin singular, it does not found any collective or group. It irreducibly identifies asubjective and essential attitude for workers in the factory. To have to do one'swork specifies an unvarying form of workers' awareness, which principles andcategories are strange to organisational modifications that occurred in the plant.The category of work refers to multiple conceptions and leads to verydifferent statements, depending on which quotation we examine. None of thesestatements however is affected by the transfer of the foreman's responsibilityregarding daily management of the production to the group and by theimplementation of a weekly group-meeting. Contrary to what management andworks council argue, "groupwork" does not renew the singular terms of thecategory of work thought by the workers.ResolutionWorkers propose an original idea of "groupwork" that questions the specific titleof this new organisation. Their points of view actually demand an alternativename that would better account for the field and the limits of the neworganisation. But we will first come back to workers' propositions andsystematically and separately resume what group, on the one hand, and work,on the other hand, mean for them.Concerning the group, workers' words are clear. The group is the newname of supervision on the shopfloor. It is an executive and decision-takingauthority, but also a deliberative one. Compared to the old supervision,deliberation is the only novelty. Group-meeting can not be dissociated from the14new first-line supervision, it is its necessary condition as well as an essentialtool for its implementation. Otherwise, it consists only on a transfer ofresponsibilities. This transfer has affected neither workers’ solidarity nor the willto install a certain justice on the line, although the group formally representsmanagement on the shopfloor. The innovation of this new form of productionmanagement strictly locates in its normative statute decreed by managementand works council. Long before these two parties decide to officially grant thesupervision to workers called together in groups, some workers already caredfor those questions, sometimes in a remarkable way, and went so far as tonegotiate with the foreman the implementation of job rotation.As for the word work, it relies on multiple conceptions that we shouldconsider separately. These conceptions have in common that they are notaffected by the institutionalisation of the group. However they do not add up,and do not merge. Work is no concept but a 'problematic word': "a word aboutwhich there is a conflict of statements, that is a conflict of thesis and arguments.Each statement supports a distinct order of the real. The statement can bematerialised or at stake, it is however essentially identified as an intellectuality,that means as a thesis, a principle" [Lazarus, 1998: 12]. In workers' statements,four different conceptions have to be distinguished. If they evoke the group, themutual aid on the line, and their own preoccupation about productionmanagement, work refers to the concrete job to which each worker is appointedand to the tasks one has to accomplish on this job (the works are not the same,do the works in the group, you do this work, I do this other one). Work actuallyfits in a concrete and objective vision. On the second hand, if workers declarethat they "work the hours for group-meetings in advance", work is specified byrates (we have a little bit faster tempo). The time identifies and characterisesthe relationship between work and production. In this case, work is referred tothe objective dimension of production, and to the subjective operation accordingto which time expresses production within the factory. The statement "the workis the same" proposes another different conception of work. According to thisconception, work refers to an instruction workers have no influence on, and justhave to implement, that is an external principle (time instructions, workprogress, product). Finally, when they argue "I have to do my work like before",workers develop a subjective and internal proposition, a self-requisition,independent from any external reference.Beyond the words and specific categories identifying them, work and groupcan be distinguished, owing to the conclusion that one is a problematic word,and the other refers to an external norm that belongs to an organisationalframework.The analysis of the paradoxical propositions of the workers about"groupwork" validates the statement "workers think", which argues that thinkingis irreducible to nothing else than itself and can not be determined by15management attitude, concrete changes or norms [Lazarus, 1996: 67]. The endof the investigation actually leads to discover essential and subjectivecategories (support, mutual aid, to have to do one's work) that are thought anddeveloped without referring to the new organisational framework, or to theconcrete and objective changes that came from it. The disjunction betweenworkers' subjectivity and forms of organisation however does not lead tocondemn "groupwork" as such. But it invalidates the position some sociologistsadopt by proposing a dialectical analysis of these new forms of organisation andby arguing they affect workers' consciousness, either in a positive way[Kuhlmann, Schumann, 2000] or in a negative one [Moldaschl, 1994].Based on the analysis of workers' statements, I propose to adopt theappellation "team production"10. This term indeed helps us to avoid anyconfusion about the renewing of the meaning of workers' collective or not, andabout the eventual changes concerning the category of work, as we showedthat none of them have been questioned by the new organisation. With "teamproduction", the new organisational framework only refers to the managementof production by teams, on the shopfloor – that is the exact extent to whichworkers limit it.10 Team production here has to be distinguished with the way Appelbaum andBatt [1994] use this term. For Appelbaum and Batt, "team production" refersto a particular production system as a whole including work organisation butalso relationship with suppliers for example, whereas here it onlycharacterises a specific form of management of production on theshopfloor.16BibliographyAPPELBAUM Eileen, BATT, Rosemary, 1994, The New American Workplace,Ithaca, Cornell University Press.<ref>BAHNMÜLLER Reinhard, SALM Rainer, 1996, Intelligenter, nicht härter arbeiten?</ref>Gruppenarbeit und Gestaltungspolitik, Hamburg, VSA-Verlag.<ref>DURAND Jean-Pierre, STEWART Paul, CASTILLO Juan, 1998, L’avenir du travail à</ref>la chaîne, une comparaison internationale dans l’industrie automobile,Paris, La Découverte.<ref>FRIEDMANN Georges, 1964, Le travail en miettes, spécialisation et loisirs, Paris,</ref>GalimardGERST Detlef, HARDWIG Thomas, KUHLMANN Martin, SCHUMANN Michael, 1995,"Gruppenarbeit in den 90ern: Zwischen strukturkonservativer und<ref>strukturinnovativer Gestaltungsvariante", SOFI-Mitteilungen, n° 22: 39-66.</ref><ref>GRANEL Michael, 1980, Gruppenarbeit in der Motorenmontage: Ein Vergleich</ref>von Arbeitsstrukturen / Volkswagenwerk AG, Schriftenreihe"Humanisierung des Arbeitslebens" Band 3, Frankfurt an Main, Campus-Verlag.<ref>HOLLMANN Reiner, NIEMEYER Edzard, 1998, Gestaltungsansätze und soziale</ref>Prozesse, Gruppenarbeit in der niedersächsischen Autoindustrie,Abschlußbericht, Universität Hanover, Institut für Soziologie.<ref>IG METALL, 1980, "Technischer Wandel und Rationalisierung aus tarifpolitischer</ref>Hinsicht", Gewerkschaftliche Monatshefte, n°4: 251-262.KUHLMANN Martin, SCHUMANN Michael, 2000, "Was bleibt von der<ref>Arbeitersolidarität?
