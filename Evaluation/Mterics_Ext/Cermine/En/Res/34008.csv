It presents the backgroundin his materialist socialization theory, which combines a social reinterpretation of the core insights inclassical psychoanalysis—the unconscious, the drives—with a theory of language acquisition. Hismethodology is based on a transformation of the "scenic understanding" from a clinical to a textinterpretation, which seeks to understand collective unconscious meaning in text, and is presentedwith an illustration of the interpretation procedure from social research. Then follows a briefsystematic account of key concepts and ideas—interaction forms, engrams, experience,symbolization, language game, utopian imagination—with an outlook to the social theoryconnections to the Frankfurt School. The practical interpretation procedure in a LORENZER-basedpsycho-societal research is briefly summarized, emphasizing the role of the researcher subjects indiscovering socially unconscious meaning in social interaction. Finally an outlook to contemporaryepistemological issues. LORENZER's approach to theorize and research the subject as a sociallyproduced entity appears as a psycho-societal alternative to mainstream social constructivism.Table of Contents1.

The Landscape Before and Around LORENZERIn their important and influential book "The Social Construction of Reality" (1966)BERGER and LUCKMANN seek to create a holistic social theory, whichrecognizes the social significance of human agency and consciousness bysynthesizing the macro-societal perspective of knowledge sociology with G.H.MEAD's micro-perspective of meaningful agency and social psychology. In aninteresting note they quite strongly ban recent attempts to synthesize Marxismand psychoanalysis:"There is a considerable irony in the fact that, of late, neo-Marxist theoreticians havebeen seeking a liaison with Freudian psychology (which is fundamentally© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung / Forum: Qualitative Social Research (ISSN 1438-5627)FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodologyincompatible with the anthropological presuppositions of Marxism), completelyoblivious of the existence of a Meadian theory of the dialectic between society andthe individual that would be immeasurably more congenial to their own approach. Fora recent example of this ironic phenomenon, cf. Georges Lapassade, L'entrée dansla Vie (Paris, Eds. de Minuit, 1963)" (BERGER & LUCKMANN, 1966, p.218, Note25). [1]Symbolic interactionism, inspired from phenomenology, and action sociologyprimarily sees society as conscious and meaningful agency in the life world andBERGER and LUCKMANN argue that knowledge sociology provides theunderstanding of how agency makes up the foundation for societal structurethrough a process of sedimentation and/or reification. Obviously they see MEAD'ssocial psychology as the concept best theorizing the subjectivity of agency. Theiraccount of socialization is almost exclusively about the societal imprint on theindividual agent—c.f. the reference to MEAD. The role of subjectivity in history(and BERGER & LUCKMANN's theory is actually also a historical account of theemergence of society) remains largely untheorized in its own right, and theyexplicitly and very quickly abstain from elaborating "a genuinely dialectic socialpsychology" which they admit would be the proper alternative to the alliance theydespise (p.230, Note 7). [2]They continue, in another note:"There is a fundamental dichotomy between the conception of man as a self-producing being and conception of 'human nature'. This constitutes a decisiveanthropological difference between Marx and any properly sociological perspectiveon the one hand (especially one that is grounded in Meadian social psychology) andFreud and most non-Freudian psychological perspectives on the other" (p.220, Note7). [3]It is a bit strange, in view of BERGER and LUCKMANN 's ambitious project, tolaunch such theoretical demarcations in a note. I tend to see these comments assymptoms of a latent awareness of a problem—a stone in the shoe—a problemthat has not been thematized before but presses itself into the horizon ofBERGER and LUCKMANN's otherwise extremely embracing and integrativework. [4]The point about FREUD is beyond dispute, but also obsolete. Apart from the onework mentioned we may after all assume that most of the psychoanalysts thatEuropean Marxists approached in the 1960's already theorized psychodynamicssocially, and were politically and theoretically committed to an emancipatorythinking in which human agency and consciousness was essential (e.g.MITSCHERLICH, 1963). BERGER and LUCKMANN might also have noticed, atthe opposite side of the gorge, ERIKSON's development of a cultural psychology(1950) as an attempt to understand the dialectic between the individual andsociety on a psychoanalytic ground—although in the first place limited to childsocialization and kept within a developmental psychology framework. In Europethe ethnopsychoanalysts simultaneously analyzed the dialectic between individual© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding.

[5]These comments from BERGER and LUCKMANN (1966) remind about thefundamental challenge connected with the conception of subjectivity and therelation between individual and society in a social science landscape where thedisciplinary domains separated knowledge of the individual from knowledge aboutsociety. It may also reflect an enduring prejudiced tendency to seepsychoanalysis as a closed community, not recognizing the very fundamentalongoing discussions between Freudian psychoanalysts and several re-interpretations of the origins of the inner psychic structures. In this landscape itappears even more remarkable, that Alfred LORENZER developed a theorywhich took the challenge to develop a social reinterpretation of FREUD's basicideas on a materialistic ground which might easily be mistaken for a biologicaland deterministic in the way BERGER and LUCKMANN obviously see thepsychoanalysis. [6]When we have focused on LORENZER within a broad and multiple tradition ofcombining a Marxian analysis of society (Frankfurt School critical theory) andpsycho-dynamic theorizing of the subject it had two interrelated reasons. One isthat he has been particularly productive for the development of a methodology ofempirical qualitative research. The other one is that his socialization theory byfocusing on language at the same time as maintaining a clearly materialistic viewon the body as well as on the socio-material structure of society has provided akey contribution to theoretical and epistemological issues of social science, thathave become articulated much later. We shall come back to this at the end of thisarticle. [7]2. Alfred LORENZER's Intellectual JourneyAlfred LORENZER (1922-2002) came from the background of being a medicalpsychiatrist, trained in psychoanalysis on a Freudian background. As a doctorand psychoanalyst, he took an early interest in societal critique and culturaltheory, taking to task the Frankfurt school of thought and its critical theory.Understanding subjective structure as influenced by societal conditionsincreasingly came to dominate his theoretical thoughts. As early as 1970, hecriticized the psychoanalytical concept of "symbol" (1970a), placed it in alinguistic science context (1970b), and subsequently expanded the application ofit into socialization theory (1972), epistemology (1974) and cultural analysis(1986). The red thread of his contribution is to provide a ground for a socialinterpretation of the basic psychodynamic forces without giving up the radicalinsights in FREUD's theory. The first step in this chain from psychoanalysis tosocietal theory was an interactionist theory of socialization (1972) in which hereconceptualized these psychodynamic forces which in classical psychoanalysissince FREUD were seen as biological, result of natural drives. LORENZERestablished a dialectical theory according to which they were results of the social© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodologyinteraction, in the first place between infant and mother (caring person), andthereby also enabled an understanding of the unconscious—the most radicalelement in psychoanalysis—as a result of the symbolic interaction. The followingworks developed methodological ideas for an endogenous understanding of thesubjective dimensions of social interaction and language—quite opposite to thedirection FREUD took in meta-psychological and cultural theory. [8]The point of departure in LORENZER's relevance to current theoretical, socialand political issues is the Copernican turn of the Freudian theory which had beeninitiated by a number of psychoanalysts: In continuation of FREUD he analyzesthe development of the structure of personality as "representing experiences ofbodily interactions" (1972, p.17; see the Acknowledgments for translation issues).But whereas FREUD saw their impact in the psyche, as predominantly distortion,disturbance and blocking of (biological) drives in the subject LORENZER seesthese social interactions and the bodily experiences of them as a dialecticalshaping of the drives into a subject, and the resulting psychic dynamics as highlysocial phenomena. The individual sensual experiences of social relations andmeanings in immediate interaction are connected with the wider social world inthe form of symbols. The issues of psychotherapy, disturbances of the psychicdevelopment, were reinterpreted as disturbances of the possibility to symbolizeindividual sensual experiences in socially recognized language. LORENZER'scritical reinterpretation of the psychic disturbances are expressed in the earlybook titles "Zur Kritik des psychoanalytischen Symbolbegriffs" ["Critique of thePsychoanalytic Concept of Symbol"] (1970a) and "Sprachzerstörung undRekonstruktion" ["Language Destruction and Reconstruction"] (1970b). On theone hand enabling a reinterpretation of the psychotherapeutic task, this critiqueon the other hand opens a new way of theorizing the psychodynamic aspects ofsocietal relations. Symbolic/cultural meaning (for the individual) is seen as acomplex mediation of social interaction and sensual experience, and hasconscious as well as unconscious aspects. Later LORENZER developed furtherhis key concept of "interaction forms" to understand the inner, pre-linguisticexperiences of practices and relations. These interaction forms are connectedwith the socially recognized language to form symbolic interaction forms, and thedeveloping of capacity for symbolic production can be seen as an integratedaspect of socialization. This understanding of the early socialization processenables LORENZER to see language, interaction and bodily (drive) processes intheir wider societal context—and we can add an epistemological perspective: Inthe context of a constructivist social science it enables us to see how ideas aboutsocietal relations are embodied in the individual socialization. LORENZER'sthoughts on the role of language in subject constitution build on the theorem oflanguage games, which he took up from the works of Ludwig WITTGENSTEINand developed further. Language is anchored in concrete social practice in adialectic unit of language use, everyday life practice and view of the world(WEBER, 2010). Language games are thus defined as the interface at whichsubjective and objective structures interact. The question of the constitution oflanguage games is, therefore, also one which addresses the constitution of therelationship between individual and society. Looked at in this way, language andawareness are inseparably linked with social practice. If the constitution of© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodologylanguage games is seen as integral to the development of subjective structuresunder objective conditions, then the individual subject can be understood anddeciphered using its ex ante social reference. [9]LORENZER's contribution to the methodology gains a wider perspective bytheorizing the genesis of the correspondence between unconscious dynamics inthe subject and unconscious or unintended dimensions of societal and culturalprocesses. What is in the first place mainly a material theory of socialization—which unlike many other theories does not see the social shaping of the individualas assimilation to social structure—is in the second place a radical epistemologyof societal dynamics. LORENZER's theory of language games and his meta-psychological and methodological notions are closely linked with the search foropportunities for epistemic reconstruction of suppressed social relationships,which are (societally) imprinted in the (many individual) psyches and in theirinteraction. LORENZER in brief draws the attention to the hermeneuticmethodology of psychoanalytic understanding. The immediate inspiration isoffered by an interpretation of interaction and cultural meaning in a way inspiredby psychoanalytic interpretation, namely "scenic understanding" whose furthermethodological foundations and methodical implementation will be taken upfurther in this article. LORENZER separates the methodological principles ofpsychoanalysis—simultaneous attention, free association and the concepts oftransfer and counter-transfer—from the clinical context of doctor-patientrelationships, and transfers them to social and cultural scientific practice. He thusemphasizes the methodological experience as opposed to direct transfers oftheoretical models since, in his view, these cannot be transferred from one field toanother. [10]The socialization theory was LORENZER's first distinguishing contribution. Itbuilds the theoretical foundation for the development of a psycho-societalinterpretation method with inspiration from the psycho-analytical interpretation ofindividuals. During the 1970's his work was widely cited and read both inGermany and abroad (notably the Scandinavian countries) and today, his ideascontinue to inform a vigorous tradition of cultural analysis and social research(LEITHÄUSER & VOLMERG, 1988; LEITHÄUSER, 1976; MORGENROTH, 1990,2010; BERESWILL, 2008; LORENZER, 1970a, 1970b, 1972, 1974, 1977, 1986,2006; PROKOP, FRIESE & STACH, 2009). A number of Scandinavian, especiallyDanish researchers have published work directly referring to this tradition, orusing the methods more or less in accordance with it, most of it published inDanish (for an overview see WEBER, 1996, 2007, 2009, 2010; SALLINGOLESEN, 2004, 2007a, 2007b, 2011; SALLLING OLESEN & WEBER, 2001,2002). However, LORENZER is little known outside German speakingcommunities. For a long time, only one small example of his work has beenpublished in English translation (LORENZER & ORBAN, 1978). Later another texthas been introduced, translated and posted in the internet (LORENZER, 2002a[1981]; SCHAFFRIK, 2002). But "in-depth hermeneutic analysis" remains largelyunfamiliar to English-speaking audiences. When we in a joint research networkexplored the parallels between this tradition and pioneering work in theAnglophone psycho-social research (e.g. HOLLWAY & JEFFERSON, 2000), the© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodologylanguage based a-symmetry was obvious and it seemed imperative to provideaccess to some of the non-Anglophone research tradition to a wider audience. [11]In the following we will concentrate on the methodological impulse from culturalanalysis in social research. In a late stage of his work, in the key text in"KulturAnalysen" [Cultural Analyses] (1986), he coins the (title)notion of"Tiefenhermeneutische Kulturanalyse" [In-depth Hermeneutic Cultural Analysis],which focuses on the systematic reconstruction of unconscious meaningdimensions in analysis of literary texts. This text played a significant role in theintensive multilingual discourse in our research network between Danish, Germanand British researchers, of which half were not German-speaking, facilitated by atranslation (by Mechthild BERESWILL & Christine MORGENROTH, unpublished).The book as a whole is a collective work with a number of case studies, mainly onliterary texts, but also one (by Søren NAGBØL) extending the horizon toarchitecture. "KulturAnalysen" ["Cultural Analyses"] (1986) summarizes thecontribution of his interaction theory extensions of psychoanalysis from the 1960sand 1970s and may be read as the key text to the complex meta-theoretical ideasthat have proven useful in empirical studies in many areas of social life under thegeneral heading of "Tiefenhermeneutik" [In-depth Hermeneutic] (1986). [12]LORENZER believes this is where what he calls the "hard and provocative work"(1986, pp.16f.) in the psychoanalytical critique of society and culture enters. Hesees the position of psychoanalysis between differing disciplines against whoseborders it grates. The "conflict potential" of a psychoanalytic approachtraditionally arises from revealing the social constraints a subject faces, but, moreimportantly, how desires and past experiences may influence e.g. culturalproductions like literature. LORENZER here emphasizes the difference betweena therapeutic and a social or literary discovery process:"Where therapy is concerned, the origin [of the subject] is investigated by asking: howdid the conflict arise in the case of this individual? In cultural analysis, however, thequestion is: what kind of conflict are we dealing with? The focus is on the conflictbetween unconscious desires and conscious values" (p.67). [13]In fact the notion of conflict in the last sentence might be a bit misleading intranslation—in LORENZER's German text it reads "Auseinandersetzungzwischen," which implies "intensive interrelation" or "interaction between" in thesense of connecting rather than a conflict between two independent opposingparties, or in philosophical terms: It is an intrinsic rather than an extrinsic relation.In LORENZER's thinking the relation between the conscious and the unconsciouslevels of the subject is more complex than just being a conflict. They are bothinfluenced by experiences in the past, and conscious and unconscious dynamicsinterrelate in the ongoing processing of cognitive and emotional aspects ofexperiences. Unconscious dynamics which refer to contradictions experienced inthe past (and hence of cultural and societal nature), which may have becomeunconscious, while their conflictual meaning may have been transferred toanother content are particularly important in the original therapeutic context. Butthe very existence of unconscious dynamics which are of cultural and societal© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodologynature, and the fact that they remain in interaction with meaning making andconscious engagements in the present is the important insight for interpretation ofsocial interaction and cultural meanings. LORENZER and his colleagueseventually demonstrates this potential in interpretation of arts products, but theinsights in societal nature of the subjective processes opens a door to interpretnot only cultural products, but to interpret interviews and other qualitative materialfrom empirical research of a wide range of more profane social practices andspheres. [14]3. In-depth Hermeneutic Cultural AnalysisAlfred LORENZER's introduction article "Tiefenhermeneutische Kulturanalysen"in the book "KulturAnalysen" (1986) is as close as he comes to spell out amethodology. Basically he points to the hermeneutic (interpretational) nature ofthe form of understanding which is used in psychoanalytical therapeutic practice,generalizes it in what he calls the "scenic understanding," and comments thenature of this transformation. The particular value of these thoughts mainlybecome evident in reflecting a research practice by means of researcherssubjectively engaging in the interpretation, tracing aspects of social relationswhich are not immediately visible and may be not even conscious for socialactors. For this reason we developed an interpretation process example of a textwhich had been presented in the research group. In the following this samplescene and our interpretation of it will be used for illustration linking ourinterpretation steps along this short sequence with central passages ofLORENZER's text. As it usually is the case the interpretation process became anillustration in itself—interpretation requires the engagement of the interpreters inan interaction with the text which transcends the obvious meaning of the text, andhence becomes part of the interpretation in itself. We took up a brief scenepresented in the Dubrovnik workshops by our British colleague JoanneWHITEHOUSE, who used qualitative methods to study a popular yet highlycontested form of media product—the reality TV program Big Brother, which hassparked heated debate not just in Great Britain (REDMANN & WHITEHOUSE-HARE, 2008). We wanted to illustrate LORENZER's methodological and meta-theoretical reflections using an empirical example from the discipline of culturalstudies to show what scenic understanding might mean for empirical analysis. [15]We analyzed the reaction of a female viewer as portrayed in the following scene.We interpreted the scene as a representation, not as a factual account that canbe read at face value, and not as a transparent subjective expression. Weassumed that such representations are based on shared cultural experience andprovide us with access to subjective and social dynamics, which we attempt toreveal with the aid of LORENZER's thinking. [16]The structure of this type of program is a closed group who is monitored in theirinteraction, and the viewers are invited to vote about who should be sent home ateach stage of the show. An interviewee, Lou, reported (to Joanne) that she hadbeen watching an episode of Big Brother. One of the housemates, Jonny, offereda second housemate, Adele, a cup of coffee. Adele refused in a friendly fashion© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodologybut as Jonny walked away she mouthed the words "Fuck off" to his retreatingback. The interviewee, Lou, was so outraged by what she took to be Adele's two-faced behavior that she decided she would vote to have Adele evicted from theshow and, moreover, that she had to do this straight away. Because her ownphone was out of order she rushed from the house to use a public phone box onthe corner of her street. Unfortunately, the phone box was occupied and, feelingincreasingly frustrated, the interviewee started banging on the phone box doortelling the person using it to hurry up. "I just wanted her (i.e. Adele) out," sheexplained in the interview. [17]At first glance the text we looked at irritates and confuses, displays a remarkableamount of emotion and contains a variety of action and interaction levels which allrun together. It may also provoke normative reactions in the interpreter, not leastas regards the contested TV format that attracts large numbers of viewers. Thescientific and popular controversies concerning a program like Big Brother thuspoint to underlying issues of subject and society in the context of social change:on the one hand the age-old discussion about how much influence mass mediahas in guiding people's actions, on the other hand the much more interestingquestion about how the contents of the media engage with the subjective issuesof the audiences. [18]The manifest meaning of the sequence is readily visible: we are witness to anemotionally loaded reaction in the context of a medially presented group playergame. The structure of sequence the constitutes a dual scene: contestants in thecontainers and contestants in front on the TV enter into a relationship with oneanother whereby the quality of their relationships is the key to further exclusion orinclusion of individual players. In other words, the publicly celebrated relationshipsbetween the inhabitants of the container give the viewers a chance to enter into arelationship which forms the basis for their decision on whether or not to vote foror against a particular contestant. [19]There are several simplistic interpretations of the scene which are near at hand(and the interpreting group did not evade the temptation in the first place): wecould interpret it as a confirmation of a culturally pessimistic standpointconcerning the increasing degeneration of the mass media, or in a more or lesspsychological sense as an expression of a threatened if not damaged subjectivitywhich comes to light with the loss of key self-determination skills. Althoughdifferent in focus they both leave little space for understanding subjective agency.In a way they treat the social agent as a patient and diagnose his/her vulnerabilityfor social conditions. Alfred LORENZER provides the theoretical arguments foravoiding such premature classifications. In LORENZER's work, we read thatapart from the manifest and latent meaning levels "texts" house an unconsciousmeaning dimension which we can enter as readers, as observers or asresearchers."The impulse in psychoanalytical therapy is to change the patient who is beinganalyzed. In the reader-text relationship the opposite is the case. Here it is thereader/analyst who is subject to change. If the reader as an interpreter acknowledges© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodologythe emotional power of the text and does not stand in awe of it, his consciousness willbe changed—at least, this is the case if he does not abuse the text-readerrelationship by simply reading into the text a pre-existing and well known version ofpsychoanalysis" (1986, p.28, our translation). [20]This distinction takes our attention in another direction. We concern ourselveswith the emotional power of the text and thus with the relationships it offers to thereaders. How do we as interpreters take up this offer? How do we react to Lou'sdescription—normatively, amused or intrigued? This line of thinking may be easilyaccepted when dealing with "fine arts"—it resonances discussions about thecriteria of quality in poetry, e.g.—but here we deal with a profane narrative aboutprofane television watching. Posing these questions to the interpreters of theshort research scene led us away from commenting and classifying the actions inthe actual text per se, and towards its emotional qualities and evocative power inrelation to the reader. And further the question of the 'relationship between textand reader' applies to the relation between the Big Brother-show and its viewers,in this case to Lou. What is it that makes her act so impulsively? If we go by whatshe says, then contestant Adele's two-faced attitude is what made Lou want tovote Adele immediately off the show and head out to find a telephone. Accordingto Lou, Adele's behavior, which she describes as two-faced and underhandedlyaggressive, sparked her unbridled anger; she is openly aggressive and attacksanother person within her action radius. [21]The theoretical distinction of psychoanalysis is the theory of the unconscious(FREUD, 1957 [1915]). It is actually a more complicated theory about levels of(un)consciousness with grey zones and displacements, which in FREUD'sversion is a precondition for the therapeutic process as well as for theinterpretation of dreams. The first methodical issue is to gain access to this level,not with an individual therapeutic aim, but in order to understand its socialmeaning. The interpretation of texts, be they literary works, field notes or excerptsfrom interviews, also constitutes a multilayered scene. In the case in question, wereconstruct a dual scene in which various interaction dynamics overlay oneanother and create a new scene in which we as interpreters become involvedrelative to those dynamics. We find Lou's extreme over-reaction difficult tounderstand and tend to distance ourselves from it. [22]LORENZER goes on to say that literary texts contain a provocation which goesbeyond individual and biographically specific reception patterns and points tosocietal, collective motives and meaning substance:"The provocation lies in content in the text itself. As such, its impact goes beyond theindividual, it is perhaps societal-collective [gesellschaftlich-kollektiv], possibly evenspread over many epochs. The unconscious in literature under consideration, is acollective unconscious, although admittedly not in Jung's sense. It consists of praxisfigures [Praxisfiguren], which—as it were—demand to enter consciousness, andcontains forms of life [Lebensformen], whose access to general consciousness hasbeen barred and whose value, in consequence, has not been openly tried out" (1986,p.28, our translation). [23]© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal MethodologyIn interactionist (social) reinterpretations of psychoanalytical theory, includingLORENZER's theory of socialization, the unconscious level is just as much as theconscious a result of life history experience of social interaction. For the samereason the unconscious is assumed to contain a potential for social imaginationwhich goes beyond the actual state of consciousness—either because it containsinteraction experiences that have later been excluded from consciousness, orbecause it contains anticipating ideas of something "emerging" which has not yetbeen realized in social practice. Continuing the previous quotation LORENZER says:"These not-yet-conscious [Noch-nicht-bewusst] praxis figures—as Bloch says—generate a utopian potential. It is the work of hermeneutics to reveal this utopianpotential and, in so doing, to take a stand against petrified circumstances[versteinerte Verhältnisse]. [...] Why do we prefer the term in-depth hermeneutics tocharacterize this approach? The answer is: because the practice of in-depthhermeneutics is the distinctive feature of psychoanalytical interpretation. ... The in-depth element of the hermeneutic approach is only to be found in psychoanalysis andunderlines the central subject of psychoanalytical inquiry: the unconscious" (1986,p.28, our translation). [24]LORENZER's understanding of the critical and utopian potentials in theunconscious articulates an important dimension in the thinking of critical theory orFrankfurt school. The Frankfurt school generally sees theorizing and critique as akey to social imagination and utopian ideas. And since this thinking is based onmaterialist assumptions it means that imagination is endogenous, i.e. must bediscovered and articulated from within societal reality, as it is condensed inADORNO's argument in the positivist dispute:"But if theory is not to fall prey to the dogmatism over whose discovery scepticism—now elevated to a prohibition on thought—is always ready to rejoice, then theory maynot rest here. It must transform the concepts which it brings, as it were, from outsideinto those which the objects has of itself, into what the object, left to itself, seeks tobe, and confront it with what it is" (1976 [1969], p.69). [25]In HABERMAS' thinking the term of ideology critique spells out the need to revealendogenous potentials for societal change through a critical analysis of socialrealities themselves. Change does not come from above or from outside. Butwhereas HABERMAS first of all sees the key in deconstructing observation andreflection of "petrified social relations" and the societal institutions which make upthe guises of power, social inequality and reified relations Alfred LORENZERlooks for the potentials in socialized psyche, in the dynamics between theconscious and the unconscious. And this brings the argument back to the text:"Does this imply that the unconscious is the sole aim of psychoanalyticalinterpretation and that every 'manifest/apparent meaning', every deliberately intendedmeaning of the text the author makes, has no significance? Indeed not, such anapproach would not justify the title of a psychoanalytical literary and cultural analysis.This collection of analyses shows that the manifest meaning in no way can be seen© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodologyas a 'ladder', which can be put aside in the moment you have reached the goal 'deepdown there' " (1986, p.29, our translation). [26]LORENZER's theoretical deliberations point to socially taboo, degeneratelifestyles and utopian moments of social practice which while being unconsciouslymaintained also emerge to influence [our] conscious, for example with the help ofliterary texts. Their provocation, according to LORENZER, lies in the fact thatthey transport aspects of a collective unconscious which forces itself into theconscious. On the one hand Lou's arguments concerning Adele's two-facedbehavior lines up seamlessly with the socially accepted meaning pattern of goodor bad behavior. But the emotional charge "beyond the boundaries of language"in the vehement desire to be rid of the other woman goes far beyond suchsocially acknowledge configuration. To have Adele thrown off the show, Lou isprepared to throw an unknown stranger out of the telephone box. [27]So what is it that forces itself into consciousness? The TV show (culturalmeaning) elicits unconscious desires and identifications (interaction forms) whichinfluence the agency and produces an intense ambivalence. The reconstructionof this ambivalence helps to reveal the unconscious in the text. We will addressthe interpretation procedure in more detail later. For the time being, however, wewill stay with the relationship between manifest and latent meaning and read whatLORENZER thinks:"... the distinguishing feature of psychoanalytical cultural analysis as an 'in-depthhermeneutic' is about the recognition of an independent level of meaning below themeaning generating level of language symbolism. While the manifest meaningresides in the socially recognized figures of consciousness, a level of unconsciousinteraction forms [Interaktionsformen] is pushed into consciousness on the level oflatent meaning. It is certainly the case that this level of meaning, 'excluded byconsciousness and social consensus', is one in which psychoanalysis was originallyinterested, and which Freud counted to parapraxes. But, at the same time, themanifest text-meaning is still important—as the counterpart to what is concealed-forbidden. Manifest- and latent-text meaning construct a contradictory pair, whichpsychoanalysis must seek to resolve [aufzuheben hat]" (1986, p.29, our translation). [28]For cultural analysis, when unconscious interaction forms are pushed to theconsciousness it means that the latent meaning of a text offers a potential accessto understand collective dimensions of the unconscious. Manifest and latentmeaning are dialectically related because language use point to non-verbal orpre-verbal dimensions of social interaction as LORENZER describes in theconcept of "unconscious interaction forms." It does not mean that we can simplyidentify the unconscious and the non-verbal: unconscious meanings are in thetext as latent meaning or meaning potentials. [29]If we look at the construction of the show—and numerous other shows of thesame type—as performance of interaction, and at the same time an invitation tointeraction with the viewer the point is that the show invites the viewer to exertsome kind of control in the limited world in the container—and in this case make a© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodologymoral judgment on the behavior of the figures in the show. However, he/she canonly do it in the dichotomous form of voting out or in. You are not only invited tomake a regressive simplification of complex issues, you are forced to do it, if youwant to participate in the interaction. So the relation between the inner logic of theshow and the seemingly extreme actions of the Lou—and in the second place theevocative power of the text in relation to the interpreting researchers—might be akey to trace the unconscious meanings. LORENZER's attempts to characterizethe unconscious:"The unconscious is a non-verbal, non-symbolic system of meaning, which iscontrary to individuals' linguistic order ... It is•••'autonomous', because it comes into existence within specific and concretemutual exchanges and is therefore the inscription of this particular ontogenesis'systematic', because from the first moment in a life-history, one memory tracefollows another each becoming interwoven with the other [organismisch]'meaning'-full because the engrams are simultaneously the sedimented forms ofpast social interplay and drafts for that of the future (1986, pp.46-47). [30]In this framework Lou's disturbingly excessive action that lends the scenestructure can be interpreted as systematic and meaningful in the context ofbiographical patterns. Autonomous elements prove to be the physical action,leaving the house, the purposeful movement in space, the hammering against thedoor of the telephone box. The TV show seems to set a subject's past interactionexperiences in motion, which defy any language based symbolization yet remainregistered as a bodily experience of social interaction. The reactivation of theseinteraction forms happens not in the sense of simple repetition of old conflicts, butas part of a dynamic interaction between old, past and new, current interactionexperiences. The unconscious meaning of the scene points to something which isunexpressed and yet symptomatic. In the first place it evaded the perception ofinterpreters and gave way to irritation and premature classification of thesubjectivity of only one actor in the scene (Lou). This individual psychologicalinterpretation saw impaired ego functions: reality checks and emotional controlare rendered ineffective and an archaic breakthrough of revenge impulses. [31]But if we look at the scene in the context of its multilayered structure, a structuraldouble bind comes to light which neither the contestant in the container nor thevoting viewer (like Lou) can escape: friendly, polite and civil behavior stands indiametric opposition to the competitive nature of the game and the dilemma itentails. Against this backdrop, Lou's rather excessive reaction can be seen toperform the role assigned to her by the TV-show. But they may also encompassanticipations of future behavior and interaction scenarios—imaginations about atransparent and preferably dominance-free communication—her reaction is aresponse to the unfulfilled desire for civility towards others, which Lou believesAdele is failing to demonstrate. Paradoxically she is driven to the oppositeextreme and resorts to violence herself.

Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal MethodologyThis interpretation of the unconscious in the text refers to experiences prior to thedevelopment of the ability to symbolize, yet they retain their effectiveness inscenic arrangements. But it does not mean simply that unconscious/conscious isthe same as pre-language/linguistic—the relation is more complex:"The term 'configuration of practice figures' [Gefüge von Praxisfiguren] refers to thefollowing characteristic. The interplay from which memory traces (interaction-forms)emerge is nothing but the exchange of gestures, bodily movement, and sociallyshaped and significant body processes: it is 'practice'. Every interaction-form is partof this practice, and therefore encompasses but goes beyond language. Practice as awhole is to some extent, submitted to the rules of language, but also partly resistantand reluctant, or is part of something utopic not-yet-conscious, i.e. part of humanbehavior that has not become encompassed in language" (1986, p.47, ourtranslation) [33]But how do we store these non-language-related memory traces, and how canwe approach them in the interpretation? The following section explainsLORENZER's theory regarding the constitution of the scene in the context ofintra- and intersubjectivity and the role played by the body and language. Thefollowing section returns to the methodological implementation in "scenicunderstanding." [34]4. Engrams, Interaction Forms and the Language GameAt a very early stage in his theoretical writings, Alfred LORENZER meant thatinteraction experiences become embodied during the embryonic phase and thefirst few months of life. Thus, through the body's senso-motoric reactions, theyhelp to shape specific and later-life experiences. Such interaction patterns whichbecome ingrained in the body stand for an entire lifetime in a constant dialecticwith the discursive demands of the social environment which are subsequentlycommunicated through language. The start of this development in very earlychildhood is both a physical and a holistic process based entirely on sensoryperceptions. In LORENZER's own words, this means that:"The 'visual', 'tactile', 'acoustic' denote modes of sensory reception, which aredirected by the central nervous system from the periphery of the body and which arethen stored in precisely defined 'areas of the brain' (...). The inscription of thesevisual, tactile and acoustic impressions happens via 'engrams'. These engrams are'memory traces' in Freud's terms. Although this process is common to all infants, ofcourse, the engrams of a single person are the memory traces of his or herexperience as a particular individual. They have an individual profile. Just as Freudpointed out, in front of his time, in his book on 'Aphasie' (Freud, 1891), that cerebralphysiological functions and 'psychological' content cannot be separated it is obviouslythe experiences of the memory traces which are codified as engrams. And thismeans that the contents of memory (which is, of course, social) modifies the brain'sphysiological structures of the nervous system. And of course the memory tracescombine into ideas of objects. And like the sensual impressions—visual, tactile,acoustic—combine into an idea of object, likewise will the objects that are perceived© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodologyin different situations combine to form definite and concrete scenes. But this isexpressed inaccurately: Of course it is the scene which is the immediate subject ofthe infant's experience. An awareness of individual objects only emerges from thescene gradually, and may later, in differing situations, combine to form well definedpoles and stable figures within the scenic Gestalt" (1986, pp.41-42, our translation anditalics). [35]Memory traces are non-verbal references to life practice, of experiences. Theseexperiences are based on the efforts to achieve pleasure and avoid unpleasure.LORENZER emphasizes the "bodilyness" of these processes. LORENZER'stheory of the language development and the notion of scenic understanding areactually in this sense coming close to contemporary cognitive science and thenew synthesis between "human" and "biological" understanding of the brain(LORENZER, 2002b). Looked at today, he anticipates a paradigm shift in theview of the brain as a holistic system (PELED, 2008; LEUZINGER-BOHLEBER1998). In memory research, embodied cognitive science has moved away fromthe notion of the human brain being a kind of computer designed to processinformation. Memory is now understood as an active process involving the entireorganism and based on senso-motoric emotion coordination processes whichoccur in direct relationship with constantly adapting re-categorization processes.In LORENZER's terms, this means that a child's early experiences of stimulusresponse games with its mother and other close individuals are retained asmemory traces, as specific interaction forms. They are a lasting, naturalimpression of genuine social interaction forms in the subject. This is whatLORENZER calls "socialized nature." [36]But how do single memory traces become a configuration of many which evolveinto life experiences and a complete life world? The notion of the scenic primacyposes the question the other way round. Experience is holistic, strongly shapedby sensory impressions and by satisfying (or their opposite) experiences. "Thescene takes shape step by step through alternating and mutually constitutiveinteractions between changing and unchanging modes of experiences" (1986,p.42, our translation). [37]The self-correction in the quotation (Paragraph 35, italics) is interesting—it seemsthat LORENZER here moves from one way of seeing the development ofconsciousness—as a combination of sensual elements into images of objects—toanother, more holistic, in which an undifferentiated scenic experience oriented bythe subject-to-be—gradually evolves through differentiation to become moredetailed and stable object images, and it seems as if the self-correction is a traceof this theory development. The new conception aligns with empirically basedknowledge about infancy development (STERN, 1985). The process describedalways involves bodily processes:© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodology"If we take bodily processes into account, three aspects of the scenic becomeapparent1. The imprint of situational experience [Situationserfahrung] is assimilated by aninternal ensemble of tactile, acoustic etc. receptors. Likewise the receptorensemble depicts the panorama of real impressions in the internal sceniccomposition of the engrams.2. Even if not from the first moment but very early these situational engramsrepeatedly go beyond the inevitable dialectic that exists between bodilysensations and their counter-impulses. The memory trace [Erinnerungsspur] ismore than the consequence of a simple process of stimulus-response; in itself italready has sensorimotor qualities. A simple illustration of this scenic compositionof sensorimotor experience formation is to be found in the banal fact that thestimulus is sure to provoke its reaction. For example, the noise of a mouse'results' in the cat turning its head.3. And the foundation for all this is in the scenic unity between the 'inside' and'outside', between the organism and its environment ... This interplay is thefoundation for everything. It remains the basic model, from which we will alsolater have to depart" (LORENZER, 1986, p.43, our translation). [38]The scene is thus shaped by the bodily referent inherent in it from the outset. Achild's earliest perception, no doubt while still in the womb, is a holisticexperience. The perceptive instruments are an ensemble of receptors which givethe external world in intra-psychical space a scenic structure. The bodilyprocesses described by LORENZER should not, however, be seen as natural oringrained reflexes, even if they seem quite similar. The senso-motoric processcan be readily recognized in a nursing mother whose milk production is activatedthe moment her child cries and not when the hungry child starts to suck at herbreast. The baby's interactive need, the stimulus, is perceived and understood bythe mother as a holistic experience, and her body responds immediately—holistically, scenically and faster than it could ever be triggered by any consciousdecision. But they are learned in social interaction. [39]Hence, this describes the scenic unit between the organism and its environment.The scene always encompasses both, "internal" and "external," and supports thestatement that "this interplay is the foundation for everything." Such interplayprovides the basis for human experience, it remains both active and necessaryone's whole life long and constitutes an ever-more discerning ability to take innew experiences."Let us concentrate on the original experience: the scenic interplay and its effect onhuman development. This interplay, whether occurring within pre-natal, post-natal orfamilial constellations, has two fundamental qualities: satisfying andunsatisfying/harmful. In consequence, human development occurs against thebackground of 'ananke', the basic human state of vulnerability. Humans in particularare dependent on a constantly flowing and satisfying exchange with theirenvironment. This is very obvious at the outset of life, but it continues thereafter...This state of dependency keeps this interplay going and pushes it in the direction of© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodologythe satisfaction of needs. Long before this compass orientating us to the satisfactionof needs is laid down, there still exists a requirement that needs are met. The basichuman state of vulnerability is the source of the drive towards exchange andinterplay: the first fundamental content of this drive is directed towards satisfyinginteractions and the defense against unsatisfying and damaging ones. The drive istherefore the urge both to accept and seek out specific interactions fulfilling andsatisfying needs. It is clear that such requirement and needs have their origin inbodily metabolism. The need for human contact evolves from this. Sexual needs bearwitness to these bodily origins" (p.44). [40]LORENZER defines drive as the ensemble of all efforts to achieve satisfaction.This satisfaction is only achievable in social relationships—also for the most basicbiological needs. The active search for satisfying interaction with the socialenvironment, including specific individuals with whom a relationship is formed,shapes a structure of "specific interaction forms." It is the memory traces ofsatisfying experiences which, in interplay between "internal" and "external,"achieve their unmistakable form and subsequently become an ensemble, aformation. LORENZER maintains the biological dimension of the drive theory byemphasizing the pleasure-unpleasure principle. At the same time he integratesthe theory into a new view of early social interactions whose ongoing importancehe develops in the interplay between the internal and external, between biologicalneeds and the social forms in which they can be satisfied and are reconfigured. [41]This dialectic gives rise to the life-long development dynamic of the subject ininteraction with other subjects and the world. But at what point does languagecome into the game? The early pre-verbal, scenically stored interactionexperiences, the "specific interaction forms," gradually include verbal imageswhich appear in the interaction. Simple (pre-symbolic) interaction forms andspoken words, which are in themselves holistic and situated entities of meaning,defined in social interaction, are the material for the development of a symboliclevel. Alfred LORENZER takes up this link between interaction form and verbalimages, as a process of symbol-building and emphasizes that:"Again: word and interaction together construct the language symbol. Therefore Ihave called this a 'language symbolic interaction form' [SprachsymbolischeInteraktionsform]. When word and interaction are joined in this way practice is—vialanguage—fully at our disposal" (p.50, our translation)."The 'power of language to regulate practice' when oriented outwardly encompasseswhat we term 'action' or 'conscious perception'. However, when oriented inwardly weterm it 'internal reflection', 'conscious emotion' etc. In relation to the task ofpsychoanalysis, we can now begin to see what is meant by 'language destruction andreconstruction': the separation of the unit of language and practice and converselythe therapeutic attempt at their restitution" (p.51, our translation)."Only when a complex of sounds has found its appropriate place in the context of thelanguage-sign, and the syntactic level of language links with the pragmatic andsemantic nature of language, only when this is accomplished a full language figure[Sprachfigur] that corresponds with the scenic practice figure has been established.© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal MethodologyOnly then the language figure has assumed the nature of scenic representation"(pp.52-53, our translation). [42]When the interaction form in this way is symbolically expressed and thus gainsaccess to the conscious it enables reflection on one's own behavior and providesthe conditions necessary for reasoned tentative action. Only with language doesthis become clearer: language symbolic interaction forms integrate social practicein a more comprehensive and differentiated organization framework. [43]This notion leads directly to the concept of the language game LORENZERdeveloped after WITTGENSTEIN. The latter defined the language game as adialectic unit of life practice, language use and world view (2009 [1953]).WITTGENSTEIN's language game notion was in fact primarily critical to previousphilosophical ideas of language and scientific statements, seeing languagemeaning as a result of language use and the social practices in which languageuse is inscribed. LORENZER expands this notion by incorporating unconsciousdimensions which were not addressed in WITTGENSTEIN's concept. He seesthe language games not as mere conventions but as dynamic result of anegotiation between language user with different experiences and practices, andhence based in these social practices. With LORENZER's extension it meansthat this negotiation also involves non- and pre-verbal experiences and alsoharbors elements that are products of a destroyed symbolization of experience.Language as an instrument of symbol-building is not simply based on the pre-symbolic interaction form, but actually contains it. For this reason the pre-symbolic interaction form remains virulent one's whole life long, is inseparablylinked to subsequent, development history-related verbal expression or, beingexcluded from the language symbol spectrum, seeks out other-than-verbal waysof finding expression. Today, it is not only clinicians but also social researcherswho describe this form of active expression as "enactments." They are theunconscious, soulless repetition of interaction experiences that the subject, eitherin times of great need or in response to emotional pain, has tended to separate,disassociate or repress. While they cannot, therefore, be integrated into theindividual processing and development process, they nonetheless shape thatprocess. [44]If, as described earlier, the early interaction experience cannot be symbolized itstill remains an action-driving component of the individual-subjective structuresand their experience forms. How it differs from symbolized, verbal forms is seenin the subject's inability to reflect on those experience forms. The subject is notable to draw upon practice through language. At the same time, as LORENZERrepeatedly emphasizes, the non-verbal interaction form is always linked tosubsequent language symbolic forms. The ability to express one self verbally andpre-verbally involves many other aspects. The language game as a concept toidentify conflict dynamics in this dual perspective of social and individual ispresented in one of LORENZER's earlier works as follows:© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodology"The term 'language-game' is productive in a number of ways:a. As a category it refers to human 'character' rather than describing humanbehavior. More precisely, the model of the language-game characterizesindividual structures as sedimented versions of concrete interactions (assymbolic interaction forms), including the basic elements of both language andaction.b. Understanding the constitution of the basic elements of language and actionrenders visible the individual structure as the outcome of a specific productionprocess called 'socialization'. This enables us to see configurations ofconsciousness, as well as early drafts of future action [Handlungsentwürfe] as asynthesis of nature and societal practice.c. When integrated into a theory of individual structures, the model of the languagegame—embracing its constituents practice and language—provides us with auseful backdrop that renders visible what was previously opaque, namely theactive making of configurations of consciousness as they emerge in practices(both being realized in concrete interactions)" (1977, pp.34ff.). [45]The term language game thus refers to three dimensions of the social: theindividual structure of the subjective, the socialization process and general socialpractice. In LORENZER's work, we learned that individual structure is expressionof real interaction experiences from early life onwards. Social experiences in theirongoing production process constitute behavioral patterns which can begeneralized. Through conscious verbal action, these also bring a social practiceto light on which they are also based. Language games can thus only beunderstood in their social context. They assume a common practice-basedagreement on meaning and are always the result of social practice LORENZER,1970b). If the language game is the link between a specific interaction form and alanguage figure, then potential disturbances and interferences in the languagegame can be identified. The symbolic unit is dissolved when it is subject torepression."When the word is separated from the interaction engram the latter once againbecomes an unconscious interaction form. The word, for its part, loses its relation tosensual practice, it becomes emotionless, an empty sign. Thus the interactionengram becomes unconscious again losing all the characteristics which it had gainedfrom its relation to the word, i.e. through its introduction into the meaning system oflanguage. In other words, what is lost is: the capacity to reflect upon behaviorpatterns; and the capacity to "try things out" (and thus make meaningful interventionsin stimulus-response behavior) and to judge actions in a realistic way. ...The de-symbolized language signs suffer the opposite fate. They remain in the conscious,where they can be easily manipulated because they have been freed from theirrelation to practice figures. In this state, they are nothing more than calculation andcold-rational behavior, no longer capable of embodying the specific quality theyoriginally contained and that was originally experienced" (LORENZER, 1986, p.53,our translation). [46]© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal MethodologyLORENZER describes the characterized division between words and interactionforms in previously established language games as the destruction of language.The destruction of this symbolic unit reverses symbolization, hence the term"desymbolization," and it may occur during (subjective) conflicts later in life. Thismeans that once achieved, the ability to symbolize (verbal expression of asubjective structure) is withdrawn in relation to a specific problem which theindividual experiences as an inner conflict. The ability to express an experience oran emotional process in words is lost in connection with the issue causing theconflict. Conflict in this sense is seen as the situated clash of irreconcilable,contradictory interaction forms. [47]Interaction forms which are symbolized in language figures can thus be re-excluded from the language context. This happens with the aid of resistancemechanisms: by repressing them, they are excluded from the consciousrelationship between language and practice. Although this turns them back intounconscious interaction forms, the very fact of this reversion allows them to retaintheir energetic, dynamic relevance. They act as behavior drivers, albeit in theform of blind action and reaction which is not open to conscious self-reflection.For the individual, the recurring unconscious reenactment of a scene whosestructure is similar to the actual conflict, appears in the form of need forrepetition. [48]Symbolization through language has the advantage of being brought to mindindependently of the real situation and thus fulfills an important function in theregulation of emotion. In other words, it assists the subject's independence(tentative action, hesitation). By separating the language from the interactionform, the person is again made dependent from the effects of unconsciousconflict. He or she rarely has the power to free themselves from the dynamics ofthe unconscious scenic processes. This is in worst case the type of problems inthe clinical psychoanalysis from which LORENZER starts his theorizing. [49]The described division of the symbolic unit in the language game is evident in thecontext of spoken language, in texts and in interviews. It is expressed in thestructures of a text and is characterized by the fact that it excludes the interactionpartner, say the interpreter of an interview transcription, from the directunderstanding. The spoken word is no longer understandable for the listener orreader. The societal reference of collective meaning dimensions and a socialmeaning is interrupted. [50]So which forms of understanding might provide access to such destroyed, de-symbolized language figures? A means of access is needed that reidentifies thescenic unit, including when there is no or only an altered form of verbalexpression because the unit of language symbolic and interaction form has beenlost. This is where LORENZER's idea of scenic understanding has itsmethodological significance. [51]© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodology5. Scenic UnderstandingThe basic methodological idea in LORENZER's long intellectual journey, andparticularly when he summarized his ideas in 1986, was the possibility to learnfrom the type of hermeneutic process in psychoanalysis for the analysis ofcultural phenomena."In the psychoanalytic process, all understanding centers on and is related to themode of 'scenic understanding'. In this mode understanding is attuned to two specificobjects: the 'scenic drafts', i.e. the 'interaction forms' of the analysand. Particularlyhereby psychoanalysis provides us with a model example. If we want to understandthe analysand's life-practice, which does not exclude his concrete social reality, wemust follow the path laid down by his subjective phantasies and outlines of relations.This means we must become attuned to his scenic interaction forms as these unfoldbefore us" (1977, p.125). [52]What in this quotation is described as a therapeutic approach in the analyst'sconsultation room can be transferred to understanding texts, language andhuman behavior. Immediately, the question arises as to how a mode ofunderstanding can be practiced which explores the scenic in a non-clinicalcontext. LORENZER and his colleagues have demonstrated the approach inrelation to literary texts and cultural phenomena (LORENZER, 1986; PROKOP etal., 2009), and we have taken it a bit further into qualitative social research in anumber of more profane contexts. In the following I shall discuss themethodology of scenic understanding and its practical implementation. In otherwords, how could qualitative social research understand unknown subjectivecontent and processes which include the unconscious and draw attention to non-verbal messages. [53]Like every hermeneutic approach it is about understanding the meaning inagency and expressions, and in practical social research. Although somemeasures can be taken to make the data suitable scenic understanding can beapplicable to almost any text or phenomenon referring to agency and subjectiveexpression. The prototypical material is, though, a text, or can be seen as a text.More exotic ways of producing the data in the first place are videos orconversations held while observing videos (second order field observation). Veryoften the text is a transcript of a focus group discussion or thematic groupdiscussion. In other cases it may be an interview—individual or collective—or itmay be a field diary from an observation. [54]To identify the meaning structure of a text, we may distinguish different levels ofinterpretation:1. The obvious referential content of the text: What is being talked about?2. How do people talk to one another? This question on the meta-communicativecontent of a text takes us to the level of scenic understanding.© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodology3. Why are the characters talking in precisely this way? How can we understandit by means of theoretical knowledge combined with background factualknowledge? The first of these steps is the same as in most types of qualitativemethod. [55]Step 3 might in its form remind about an explanatory approach which seeks acausal or rule-based understanding. Since it is a hermeneutic methodology this isnot the case, instead it is a more comprehensive multilayered interpretationenabled by Step 2. The scenic understanding focuses on the ongoing tenserelation between the manifest and the unconscious meanings of a text whichrequires an imagination of the unconscious that we can imagine as a collectivereservoir of culturally rejected patterns, forbidden yearnings and suppresseddesires. In-depth hermeneutic interpretation thus focuses on the characters in therelationship described in the text and on the dynamics of the relationship betweena text and its interpreter(s) in order to trace the subjective structure of culturalconstraints. [56]The reference point in the scenic interpretation is the language used in the text,with particular attention being placed on how scenes in the text point tounexpressed desires and tensions, on how the text arranges "forms ofcommunication which makes the unspeakable" understandable, or "secures it anunnegligible position in public space" as LORENZER says about the task of thepoet (1986, p.24). The initial reading seeks to apply the same type of free-floatingawareness [gleichschwebende Aufmerksamkeit] as is known from the clinicalsituation: observations of the text and of one's own reactions are noted withoutcoming immediately to any particular conclusions or forming theoreticaldefinitions. Indications of hidden conflict dynamics include gaps, inconsistencies,unusual use of language, jumps in the story or sudden changes of subject, andremarkable ways of relating to the subject or to each other (in case of groupinteraction texts). But also the reactions, emotional states and associations of thereaders/interpreters may be indications of the dynamics we are looking for—evenif you cannot immediately understand them (compare KÖNIG, 2008, Sections 8-10). Practically an interpretation procedure is most often organized in a group.Some procedures go line by line, seeking to understand each unit of text, andrevising the understanding gradually as the later segments are taken intoconsideration. Other procedures start by an open conversation conveying "firstimpressions" and reactions from the members of the interpretation group. Insome cases you will experience that controversies and conflicts arise within aninterpretation group, evoked by the text. Using these observations and reactionsas a base, particularly powerful passages are subjected to in-depth analysis ininterpretation groups (a similarly procedure is described in MARKS & MÖNNICH-MARKS, 2003). What has already been described as the transference betweenthe individual reader and the text is now transferred to a collective understandingprocess: the transference and counter-transference dynamics multiply. Thisprocedure may lead very directly to "holistic" but preliminary interpretations thatare set under discussion, or it may produce several "loose ends." Theinterpretation discussion most likely includes reference to the concrete text andits manifest meaning, and it may very well also draw on theoretical frameworks© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodologyand on background knowledge which in the first place may support or contradictthe interpretations suggested. The discussion gradually moves into a validationdiscussion. In principle the validation will refer to usual criteria and procedures forvalidation of qualitative analysis. First of all, it will refer to the manifest text on theone hand, and on the other hand to a theoretical reflection of the whole complexof subjective agency and expression in the text and in the relation between thetext and the interpreters. [57]The assumption of unconscious meaning components makes the language gamean instrument with which to analyze individual structures and to identify collectivesocial processes. Language figures and language symbolic interaction formsalways possess a social character which goes beyond the individual, becausethey assume social understanding processes within the language community. Asa result, they can be analyzed for the social meaning they contain and give aninsight into the social configurations and their unconscious, not-yet-consciouscomponent. This is the methodological bridge which enables the unconsciousdimensions of experience to be accessed from language. They can also beobserved from the subjective perspective of the speaker and shed light on theindividual meaning contained in a specific scene. The language figure thenreports on the subjective structures and the associated experiences of social lifepractice. [58]Reacting on the remarkable behavior of Lou in the illustration exampleinterpreters were led into both an individual psychological reductive interpretation,and into a cultural criticism against the seductive effects of TV shows like BigBrother. We eventually resisted the temptations to leave it there. Led by thetheoretical points of Alfred LORENZER we developed a more comprehensivepsycho-societal interpretation which in no way excludes some regressive aspectsin the TV audience, and definitely does not exclude a critique of the quality andthe political dimensions of the TV shows. But we wanted to find the collective orsocietal unconscious mechanism that the show (re)activates in Lou as ineverybody else, and we wanted to understand why this led her to act in thisenraged and seemingly irrational way—and in this sense we also wanted torehabilitate Lou as a subject in relation to her violation of good civil behavior,assuming that she was enacting something that was collective and could not beexplained and reasoned. Referring to LORENZER's development of the languagegame concept we would seek to trace the relation between the manifest languagemeanings in her account, the societal meanings that are relegated tounconscious interaction forms pushing on conscious recognition—and the widersocietal practice in which the language use makes sense. [59]A lot of energy in the story told is condensed in Lou's sentence: "I just wanted herout"—Lou's emotional engagement seems condensed in it, and the plot of thescene seems driven by or explained by this sentence. [60]On the one hand the words seem harmless. They refer to the rules of gameswhich are in broad use and enjoy great social acceptance. Through play, childrenlearn that while it is good to win, being a good loser takes far more dignity and© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodologycourage. It is a standard pattern in the type of TV shows to which Big Brotherbelongs, and has spread to be one of the standard storylines of so calledinteractive TV broadcasts. [61]On the other hand Lou's words supported by characteristic behavior gives thespoken words an explosiveness which seems—guided by the theory ofinteraction forms and language—to indicate a further meaning than theimmediate referential one: The scene that Lou describes (which is told as havingtaken place in the recent past) seems to have harbored a trigger stimulus whichforced Lou to act impulsively. Her behavior seemed designed to ensure thatanother person be excluded and punished. On the psychological level violencereplaces symbolic reflection. This behavior, within a classical psycho-analyticalhorizon, recalls the link between oedipal conflict issues from the childhood: thedaughter wants to push the mother out to more easily gain the father's favor. Theintruder is to be destroyed. Lou might have such an individual version of astandard socialization experience. Although convenient, this dramatic constellationfrom each childhood triangularization phase would be reductive and not lend acultural analytic perspective to the understanding. Instead we should look for apotential correspondence between the individual subjective dynamic and societalmeanings that are implicitly present in the social setting of the TV show. We arelooking for the supra-individual, societal meaning of the story Lou tells, althoughindirectly. The analysis so far seemed to show that the TV show (culturalmeaning) elicits unconscious desires and identifications (interaction forms) whichinfluence the agency and produces an intense ambivalence. The reconstructionof this ambivalence should help reveal the unconscious in the text. [62]If we recall the interpretations used at the beginning of this paper, the dynamic ofinclusion and exclusion runs through all interpretations of the text sequence. TheTV games are about excluding others, exclusion is an important part of the game.This is bound up with the setting of norms which sanction the exclusion of others.The mass viewer participation seems to indicate not only social acceptance butalso a widespread need to be included in the game of excluding others. Louserves as an exemplary viewer and contestant—she stands for more than justherself, in that her reaction is representative of the desired inclusion of viewers inthe game. It seems justified to see Lou's actions and the key statement as part ofa language game in LORENZER's sense—combining the explicit and manifestmeaning with experiences of winning inclusion by joining the exclusion of others,and a societal perspective in a neo-liberal society where separation prevails overintegration. But we may also interpret her reactions so that the participation in thislanguage game elicits ambivalent feelings. We can relate it to the moral paradoxthat the exclusive action is justified by the defense for the moral integrity in thecommunity in the TV show container. [63]With the positive evaluation of what is generally seen as negative behavior(exclusion), a door is opened to judgmental and stereotypical attitudes ineveryday life which allow the unknown and the foreign to be negated withoutpunishment and eventually to be eliminated. The definition of foreign, unknownelements as a justification for exclusion is reminiscent of the well-known studies© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodologyon the social function of prejudices (ADORNO, ARON, LEVINSON & MORROW,1951), in which projective power serves in shifting everything one dislikes inoneself onto another group and then combating it in that group. The dynamic ofexclusion can take the form of collective violence if it is not harnessed and isallowed to develop uncontrolled. [64]Thus, the sentence "I just wanted her out" becomes a battle cry in a fight againstthe undesirable and alien. The vehemence with which it is spouted reveals itsindividual emotional foundation—the exclusion of the undesirable serves thedefense of the individuals own boundaries, the collective self is stabilized throughprojective stigmatization of the other and the subsequent exclusion of a persondeemed foreign and strange. The mass reception of such TV-shows seems topoint to the societal strength of a language game—a combination betweenlanguage use, outlines of life practice and a world view in which the identificationwith one's own group is based in excluding others who are deemed "strangers." Acollectively fascinating TV game which not only uses this projection mechanismbut nurtures it under greenhouse-like conditions helps foster general acceptanceof archaic, collective defensive formations. The consciousness and norms whichare communicated no longer need be subjected to conscious, reflective realitychecks. Through mass fascination and the social practice it is based upon, itappears adequately legitimated. [65]When we finally returned to the relation of the interpretation group: Do we alsohave a share in the exclusion game? The individual ”clinical” interpretation of thecase can be recognized as a defense against the collective regression whoseanalysis triggered outrage among the interpreters themselves. Whereas theinterpretation of an immature, oedipal conflict constellation or an unguidedindividual loss of control based on a simple identification appears quite harmless.Recognizing the collective nature of the unspoken interaction forms, and theambivalence in Lou's actions also makes visible that she is actually also—utopian?—longing for community and integration. [66]In our fellow interpreters' account (BERESWILL, MORGENROTH & REDMAN,2010) you can see this interpretation presented with a main emphasis on theprocess in the interpretation community and the interplay between the scenes inthe TV-show, the scene in which Lou acts, and the scene of interpreting. This isillustrating the methodological point that the transfer/counter-transfer betweeninterpreters and text take advantage of the scenic imagination. Here weemphasize the aspect of theoretical guidance because the theoretical frameworkand the psycho-societal methodological ambition—including LORENZER's notionof the collective unconscious and the scenic—really were imperatives whichhelped the interpreter group to look for the traces of the extended language gamein the text which did not appear easily. And this seems to be an essential lessonfor doing psycho-societal research.

Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodology6. An Epistemological Perspective: Psychoanalysis, Language andKnowingAlfred LORENZER's contribution enriches the interpretational social science witha new theory and some quite practical inspiration for dealing empirically with thesubjective aspects of social agency and interaction. This is in itself highlyappreciated. Many qualitative methods tend to take theirinformants/narrators/sources for granted, and to neglect the involvement of theresearcher subject as well (BREUER, MRUCK & ROTH, 2002). The awarenessof an epistemic subject-object-relativity is growing, and research activity is alsoincreasingly recognized as a social practice in it self (ROTH & BREUER, 2003),but the contributions providing tools provided for reflecting researcher subjectivityseem insufficient. LORENZER, among others, problematizes the subject category—both the subjects in the text and the subjects who are researching— redefiningthe need for reflection into an empirical issue. He takes over the Wittgensteiniannotions of language use and language games, and anchors them in thesocialization and the mediation of societal culture which for the individual maytake conscious as well as unconscious forms. Applying this extended notion oflanguage use and language game he opens a new window to the epistemicprocess—the condition of knowing is founded in the materiality of the culturalreproduction, including the researcher subject experiencing in the medium of (a)language (game) and developing it. It seems also that in this way relativistexcesses of some contemporary constructivism can be avoided by redefining therelativity issue into an empirical one. [68]LORENZER goes one step deeper in theorizing the societal framework ofunderstanding the subjects—or rather the subjectivities. In this way it also seemsas if he avoids the risk that made BERGER and LUCKMANN (1966) warn sostrongly against the alliance with psycho-analysis, the risk of reducing subjectivityto a mechanical "natural" causality. It seems that his consequent material andendogenous notion of the unconscious enables a clearly hermeneutic stancewithout giving up the bodily dimensions of the human subjectivity. [69]BERGER and LUCKMANN's comments are particularly interesting because theirbook has been assigned the honor to be the first main work of constructivism.Both LORENZER and BERGER and LUCKMANN anticipate the poststructuralistcritique of Marxism. And we think that LORENZER—exactly by building on thepsychoanalysis that BERGER and LUCKMANN warned against—produced analternative answer to their ambition of unified social theory theorizing the agency-based (re)production of societal structures. [70]It is contested if BERGER and LUCKMANN's book actually belongs to thetradition of social constructivism (COLLIN, 2002), but at least it has been possibleto interpret it into that framework. It seems more appropriate to see their book asa precursor, which made visible the wider consequences for social theory oftheorizing knowledge as a societal phenomenon. North American constructivismhas developed this into an epistemology in which the role of© 2012 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(3), Art. 22, Henning Salling Olesen & Kirsten Weber: Socialization, Language,and Scenic Understanding. Alfred Lorenzer's Contribution to a Psycho-societal Methodologyculture/knowledge/discourse surmounts the role the subject as well as thesocietal object. [71]LORENZER's work indicates a different possible continuation of BERGER andLUCKMANN's story. We may see a psycho-social theory of the subject and therole of language in subjectivity as a foundation for a parallel materialisticconstructivism, with the social philosophy of the Frankfurt School in severalgenerations as a backbone (ADORNO, 1976 [1969]). It may partly be seen as adifference between an American tradition in which G.H.MEAD is a bothrepresentative and distinguished figure, and a psycho-societal conception mainlybased in Europe A contemporary discussion of the relation between MEAD’s andLORENZER's social psychology would be really interesting. The adoption orrefusal of a psychoanalytic understanding of the unconscious dimensions of thesocial seems to be distinctive. ADORNO's theoretical integration ofpsychoanalytical theory into sociology was connected with the need tounderstand the psychic mechanisms which enabled the political success ofNazism. ADORNO in his own empirical research into the social psychology ofauthoritarianism provided a timely case for this interrelation (ADORNO et al.,1951). In order to understand in which way the particular is mediated through, butnot determined by, the societal whole you need to understand and examineempirically also the dynamics of the individual psyche—as a mediation of societalrelations. Psychoanalysis was offering a theoretically developed and empiricallyspecified research into the psyche, and the interrelations between body and(certain aspects of) consciousness—but it needed a reconceptualization insociological context—reinterpreting psychic dynamics as mediations of societalrelations—and that is to say a social psychology of culture—with implications alsofor (scientific) knowledge. [72]LORENZER's particular contribution is to present a theory of the materiality of theconsciousness which enables an immanent or endogenous understanding ofsocietal change, and a methodology for researching it empiricallys. Thedevelopment of interpretive methods building on psychoanalysis and hermeneutictext interpretation enable an empirical study of how the dynamics of knowing onthe social level could be connected with the dynamics of inner psychicexperience.
