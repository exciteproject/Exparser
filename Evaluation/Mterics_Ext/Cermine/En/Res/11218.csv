ABSTRACTAssessing the Migration Decision of Indian IT-Graduates: An EmpiricalAnalysis *by Talat Mahmood and Klaus SchömannResearch hypotheses from various migration-theory approaches are testedthrough a study focusing on a sample of 1,560 IT university students in India,just prior to the completion of their studies. The representative survey wasconducted across India during the summer of 2003. The effect of economic andsocio-political factors on the students’ willingness to migrate was examined byusing variance analysis. The results show, on the one hand, a generally highwillingness among those surveyed to migrate to industrialised countries, but onthe other hand, a substantial number of IT-students want to stay in their homecountry, India. Economic factors tend to play a much greater role on theirmigration decisions, rather than say the sending or receiving country’sinstitutional or socio-political aspects. The significance test of individual factorsshows that economic as well as institutional considerations; such as goodcareer opportunities, a high income, and a high living standard, areconsiderably more important than other socio-political as well as institutionalfactors. Indian IT graduates evaluated better career opportunities much higherin their home country as compared to other locations. In an explicit locationcomparison of Germany with India and the United States/Canada — the classicimmigration countries — as one of the potential host countries, the respondentsrated only language/culture significantly higher for the United States/Canadathan for Germany. The remaining economic and socio-political factors wererated higher for USA/Canada but do not show any significant differencesbetween Germany, India, and USA/Canada. Interestingly, a locationcomparison of India with Germany and United States/Canada shows that ITgraduates evaluated (salary, career opportunity, self employment,language/culture and social networks) significantly higher for their nativecountry than for Germany and United States/Canada. Hence, in an internationalcompetition for skilled labour/best IT specialists, India has also emerged as anattractive location.Keywords: International migration, push and pull factors, variance analysisJEL Classification: C35, F22 and J61*This is a joint project between the WZB Research Units “Competitiveness and IndustrialChange” and “Labour Market Policy and Employment”.

Die repräsentative Befragung wurde imSommer 2003 landesweit in Indien durchgeführt. Mit Hilfe der Varianzanalysewird die Wirkung der ökonomischen sowie gesellschaftspolitischenEinflussfaktoren auf die Migrationbereitschaft der Hochschulabsolventen unter-sucht. Die Ergebnisse zeigen einerseits eine hohe generelle Migration-bereitschaft der indischen IT-Absolventen in Industrieländer. Andererseits istaber das Verbleiben in ihrem Heimatland Indien eine starke Alternative.Ökonomische Gründe spielen generell für die Migrationentscheidung eine vielwichtigere Rolle als andere institutionelle oder gesellschaftspolitische Aspekteim Herkunfts- und Empfängerland. Der Signifikanztest der einzelnenEinflussfaktoren bestätigt, dass ökonomische Gründe wie gute Karrieremöglich-keiten, hohes Einkommen und besserer Lebensstandard bei allen Empfänger-ländern signifikant wichtiger sind als die gesellschaftspolitischen Determinanten(wie Ausländerfeindlichkeiten, Aufenthalterlaubnis, Sprache und SozialeNetzwerke). Indische IT-Hochschulabsolventen bewerten gute Karrieremöglich-keiten höher in Ihrem Heimland als bei allen Empfängerländern. Bei einemkonkreten Standortvergleich zwischen Deutschland, Indien und demklassischen Immigrationsland USA bewerten die Befragten die Determinanten(wie Soziale Netzwerke, Karrieremöglichkeiten, Möglichkeit der Selbstständig-keit, das Gehalt und Sprache) signifikant wichtiger für Ihr Heimatland als für dieUSA und Deutschland. Im Wettbewerb um die besten IT-Experten ist Indien imVergleich zu Nordamerikanischen Ländern und Deutschland ebenfalls einattraktiver Standort.iv1.IntroductionThe starting point of current discussions about foreign immigration into Germany has beenskill shortages on the German labour market. Particularly for specialists in information andtelecommunications technology, the mismatch on the German labour market has nowreached the critical point where it is actually inhibiting growth. Both the increasing worldwidecompetition for highly qualified specialists and managers and globalisation trends, in generalhave resulted in increased emigration of German skilled workers and, at the same time,create the need for greater immigration into growth markets. The problem has recently beenattracting growing attention from actors in industry and commerce, public policy and politics(Unabhängige Kommission Zuwanderung, 2001). The demand for information technology(IT) specialists is particularly strong with respect to specific types of technical knowledge(e.g. programming languages) and special “international skills”, such as opening up foreignproduct markets for companies and their partners.1The most influential factors behind these trends are increasing globalisation anddemographic changes. Stalker (2000) referred to the strong globalisation effect in connectionwith a heightened degree of labour mobility in the twenty-first century. Labour mobility —caused by growing pressure on the labour supply, increasing disparities in income betweenrespective countries and, above all, the revolutionary development of information andcommunication technologies — will play an increasingly important role in the internationaldissemination of knowledge and technology. On the other hand, demographic changes overthe last few decades have been leading to a population decline in Germany and are havingunwelcomed side-effects on economic development and innovative capacity.The consequences of these trends for Germany have become all too evident: moreintense international competition for the most talented, a growing demand for well-qualifiedworkers, an expansion of the markets, and a competitive disadvantage in the information andcommunication technology fields as a result of high wage costs.Two main reasons are given for the shortage of specialists in Germany: first, theconstantly changing state of the computer technology and its continued rapid growthworldwide, and, second, the failure of German universities and polytechnic colleges toprovide workers with training that is adequately geared to the needs of the labour market.Therefore, in order to roughly meet skill needs further training and retraining schemes for theavailable domestic labour force are necessary, as are efforts, already underway, to build upthe number of students and graduates in these fields (Neugart, 2000).This long-term labour shortage is considered to be the overall cause for theemergence of so-called migration flows. To solve this problem, the German Federal1According to the IZA International Employer Survey 2000 findings (IZA – Forschungsinstitut zurZukunft der Arbeit [Institute for the Study of Labor], Bonn), for which 340 telephone interviews inGermany and 170 interviews each in France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands wereconducted (Winkelmann, 2001).1Government, in cooperation with industry and commerce, has now established a “GreenCard Emergency Programme to Meet the Demand for IT-Specialists” (Green CardSofortprogramm zur Deckung des IT- Fachkräftebedarfs:http://www.bma.bund.de/download/broschueren/a232.pdf) which enables such specialistsfrom non-EU countries to work in Germany for up to five years. In view of the prevailingdomestic labour market problems, economic migration was not a desirable option. Most doagree, however, that a selective migration policy would bring overall economic benefits torecruitment countries (Zimmermann, 1996).Migration research shows that the scale of international migration will increaseoverall. Little, however, is known about the determinants of past and present migratorymovements, in particular those of IT specialists and highly educated persons, who couldgenerate such migration flows (Regets, 2001). Current discussions still focus on whether aselective policy would bring overall economic benefits. What is more, the topic of immigrationitself seems to be a controversial matter in Germany, both socially and politically.Particularly with regard to immigration from developing countries, no extensiveempirical research has been carried out to date, which takes into consideration not only theeconomic and social aspects of migration but also the political and institutional factors.Vogler (1999) has analysed these factors using an aggregated panel data set of asylum-seekers who migrated from developing countries. A study by Fiedler (2000) deals with thequestion of the conditions for which highly qualified IT workers migrate from India toGermany. To conduct this study a questionnaire was used to interview 48 employees of anIT company: the results confirm the participants’ willingness to migrate based on migration-specific factors.Most empirical studies carried out thus far discuss in detail the question of whichfactors influence decisions to migrate. The aim of these studies is to ascertain the beststrategy for the countries involved from a migration-policy perspective, in order to controleconomically motivated migratory movements. The data basis of such research is for themost part, official statistics with the use of various methodological approaches. These studiesplace an emphasis on immigrants who have completed the migration process, whereasthose remaining in their native country are not included in such studies. In the currenteconomic environment the international labour market situation, as described above,requires a change in outlook: mutual mobility is desirable, especially in the case of high-techworkers.The aim of this study is to ascertain, on the basis of information gained throughsurveys, the economic and socio-political determinants of the decision to migrate. Whileusing variance analysis, we empirically analyse the effect of these determinants on migrationdecisions by IT university students in India, just prior to the completion of their studies, as if2they would migrate to Germany or some other high-wage country.2 In addressing thisquestion, we test existing theories from migration research and draw conclusions for theGerman case which pertain to the various decision factors.In the second section of this paper we discuss several basic theoreticalconsiderations from which the examined research hypotheses are derived. The survey dataand the variables of the statistical analysis are then introduced. The fourth section presentsboth the descriptive findings and the test results from the variance analysis. The final sectiondiscusses implications of the research results and provides an outlook for further plannedresearch.2.Theoretical ConsiderationsAccording to Han (2000), migration is a complex process, which, as far as its emergence anddevelopment is concerned, is continually determined through a multiplicity of causes andfactors. As a rule the causes triggering this process are a mixture of objectively compellingexogenous factors (e.g. company contacts or attraction through foreign research laboratoriesand resources) and subjectively justified decisions (e.g. good career opportunities, starting afamily). A classic approach to explaining the complex and multicausal determinants ofmigration can be found in the theory of so-called push and pull factors.Push factors (migration factors) comprise all those conditions of the migrants’ countryof origin that induce them to migrate or temporarily migrate, such as political or religiouspersecution, economic crises and international wars. Pull factors (factors that attractmigrants) are those circumstances in the host country that motivate and encourage them tomigrate. Factors that may attract migrants are, for example, political stability, a democraticsocial structure, economic prosperity, better education and wage/salary opportunities relativeto those in one’s own country. It is generally assumed that with modern information, andcommunication and transportation capabilities, push and pull factors are becoming ever moreimportant to individual migration decisions. Gatzweiler (1975) pointed out that in the endevery migration decision is the result of push factors from the source country and pull factorsfrom the target country working together.An array of approaches in the migration-theory literature aim to identify and explicateimportant determining factors for an individual’s willingness to migrate or for aggregatedmigration flows. The starting point of most theoretical models attempting to explain individualmigration decisions is the neo-classical approach. The majority of micro-economic models isbased on this approach, which views migration as a form of investment that is worthwhile or2After successful completion of this pilot study, other Asian countries and/or East Europeancountries will be brought into the research project.3“profitable” for some individuals, but not so for others. The human capital approach maintainsthat migration takes place when the cost directly incurred through it will be reimbursed or will“pay for itself” through higher income in the future. Because of unemployment and othereconomic and non-economic aspects, migration is often connected with financial and socialrisks. According to neo-classical models, possible reasons for the relatively low level ofimmigration from developing countries are a strong preference for one’s presentenvironment, high migration costs, poor labour market chances, great uncertainty and thehope that developments in one’s native country might unexpectedly turn for the better.Cobb-Clark and Crossley (2001) state the family investment hypothesis for Australia,which would only be empirically tenable for “traditional” families, and not for non-traditionalfamilies in which both partners, the husband and the wife, are gainfully employed. On theother hand, the new economy of migration challenges the central role of relative incomedifferences, because it views this difference as only one important point among others withregard to the decision for or against migration.There are considerations on the macro-economic level as well, which in the end canbe traced back to a micro-economic foundation. Among these are demographic trends, self-selection of migrants, self-sustaining migration and institutional restrictions on migration.Demographic trends are quite important: higher population figures in the sending countrylead to per se greater migration flows. With regard to the causes of self-sustaining migration,so-called network effects command the greatest attention. These result from the fact that,apart from the contacts amongst themselves, migrants above all, maintain good contact withtheir native country. Through this exchange of information, the information and migrationcosts go down for all future migrants. People who have migrated in the past help the nextones with assimilation in the receiving country and also help reduce psychological costs thatmay arise through separation from one’s native country (Bauer, Epstein and Gang, 2000).The other approach is based on political as well as economic factors and holds thatthe cause is both the rapidly growing migration potential in developing countries in addition tothe limited opportunities for immigration as a result of insufficient intake ability or a lack ofreceptiveness. Hence, when analysing migration flows the basic institutional conditionsshould also be taken into account (Vogler and Rotte, 2000).Relative to the large number of theoretical approaches (cf. Borjas, 1994; Vogler,1999), there are few empirical findings, particularly with regard to migration from developingcountries. This is due, in part, to a lack of suitable or adequate data sets, in addition to thefact that no extensive national or international research has been carried out up to now. Aswell, there are hardly any studies available that analyse the determinants of internationalmigration, which take into account not only the economic and social aspects of migration butalso the political and institutional factors. Furthermore, very few of these studies deal with thequestion of why migrants, despite knowledge of the incentives, stay in their native countryand do not emigrate.4An empirical study by Marr (1975) analysed migratory movements from the UnitedStates, the United Kingdom and Germany to Canada from 1950 - 1967. According to him,relatively better working conditions and higher income played a significant role as pull factorstowards Canada. A different study by DeVoretz and Maki (1983) examined the migration ofhighly qualified workers from 16 developing countries to Canada from 1968 -1973. Theyfound that occupation-specific employment opportunities were much more important for well-qualified workers than earnings opportunities. In contrast, Greenwood and McDowell (1991)gave differences in income as the most important push factor.An empirical study by Zimmermann (1994) examined asylum-related emigration fromfour major regions — Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East — to the EuropeanUnion during the years 1983–1992. He found that the level of unemployment in the individualcountries had the expected negative impact on immigration, whereas the size of therespective labour market and the level of its relative wages exerted a positive influence.Huang (1987) chose to focus on the migration of well-educated workers from 1962–1976.The estimates reveal the expected influence that the respective wage differentials wouldhave on a stay in the United States (i.e. push factor). Fleischer (1963) studied migration fromPuerto Rico to the United States and found that, here too, economic opportunities proved tobe the most significant influence for migration across national borders.Whereas the research discussed up to this point is based on the analysis of cross-sectional or longitudinal data, Vogler (1999) made use of a panel data set for his analysis ofmigration to Germany. It covers information on migration from 86 source countries for theperiod 1981–1995, including the number of asylum-seekers for the years 1984–1995.According to Vogler’s findings, the decision of an individual to migrate from a developingcountry to an industrialised nation can be interpreted as an investment. In making thisdecision the potential migrant compares the future income in his or her native country withthat of the target region and also takes into consideration the costs associated withmigration. Other factors to be taken into account include unemployment, social services andtaxes, both in one’s native country and in the country of destination (i.e. push and pullfactors).The German Economic Institute in Cologne (Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft Köln,2001) has investigated companies’ and IT specialists’ previous experiences with the GermanGreen Card. The study found that most of the reasons for taking up work in Germany were ofan economic nature. First and foremost, it is especially important for almost all foreignspecialists that they be given the opportunity to do “interesting work” in Germany. Foreign ITspecialists next rank the advanced vocational training offered in second place. Good careerand advancement opportunities are given as the next reasons for a stay in Germany.Bartel (1989) studied the migration behaviour of different groups of migrants (Asians,Europeans and Hispanics) to the United States in 1980. His research shows that the networkeffects are very strong. Regions with a high number of residents belonging to a particular5ethnic group are the preferred destination of migrants of that respective group. In both theirmicro-economic and macro-economic studies, Bauer and Zimmermann (1995) found a highlevel of significance for network effects on migration. In a recent study Bauer, Epstein andGang (2000) examined the influence of a migration network on migrants’ decisions based onlocation. They observed that the size of the Mexican network within the United States has apositive effect on the likelihood of migration.From the perspective of the receiving country, there are essentially two types ofstudies on the differences in income between native residents and immigrants. Studiesfollowing the approaches of Chiswick (1978) and Borjas (1987) find an initial incomedisadvantage for immigrants when compared to native residents who are of the same sex,educational level and age and who work in the same industrial sector. However, according totheir findings, the situation improves over time, and a gradual equalisation of earned incometakes place. Other studies using the traditional decomposition method to calculatedifferences in income associate the unexplained remainder of differences in income betweennative residents and immigrants with statistical discrimination. Recently, Nielsen, Rosholm,Smith and Husted (2001) have attributed comparable orders of magnitude of incomedifferences, to a deficiency in qualifications and work experience as well as incompleteassimilation.A good deal of the public discussion, however, revolves around the fear, not yetempirically researched, that a German Green Card might give rise to entire waves ofimmigration comparable both to the recruitment of migrants in the 1950s and 1960s and tothe consequences for the present form of the social system first and even secondgenerations migrants(Fertig and Schmid, 2001). The PISA Study findings for Germany pointto further pressure still surfacing with third generation immigrants. To bring more objectivityto this discussion, we have chosen to contribute new empirical results, which were gathereddirectly from a highly mobile group of IT specialists in an important potential source country.In this way one can speak of an ascertainment of an “upper benchmark” for potentialmigration from any one source country.3.Survey Data and Description of VariablesThis study is based on a personal survey3 of university information and communicationstechnology students in their final year of study in India. Around twenty IT institutionsparticipated in the survey. Letters to the appropriate professors explained that a foreignorganisation wished to carry out research on the topic of international labour mobility of3Survey data on migration intentions see, Burda, et al. (1998), Liebig and Sousa-Poza(2004) andMayda(2004)6university graduates. This organisation’s origin was not mentioned in order to avoid acountry-specific bias in the results.Consistent with the survey design of this study, the university students were onlyquestioned about their expectations for the future relating to possible migration decisionsduring this first stage of research. The students were information technology and electricalengineering students in their final academic year of a master’s and bachelor’s programmeand, hence, possessed to the highest academic education equivalent to that of academicallytrained German engineers. In order to analyse actual immigration to Germany and otherindustrialised countries, we will make a second survey one year later to again interview boththe graduates who migrated and those who remained in their native country. This step willenable us to compare their previous intentions to migrate with their actual decision.3.1.Questionnaire Design: Push and Pull FactorsThe questionnaire has four main sections. In the first section, the students are questionedonly about their personal characteristics. In the next section, they are only asked aboutindividual determinants that might influence their migration decisions. In the third section, thestudents are asked to rank a number of alternative countries according to their preference. Inthe final section they are to explicitly assess, taking into account both the respective countryand the importance of the various determinants, whether or not they might migrate to aparticular country.The relevant aspects to individual migration decisions are determined on the basis ofgeneral theories on migration behaviour, empirical research results and motives for migrationalready named in surveys. However, it would go beyond the scope of this project to take intoaccount all possible push and pull factors. For this reason the analysis has been restricted tothe most important factors, which are briefly presented below.3.2.Social Networks, Chain MigrationWe start with the assumption that before a person makes a decision to migrate he or shemakes a comparison of possible destinations, a task that requires relevant information aboutthe sending and the receiving country. This information may come from different sources,such as various media and information agencies that deal with the systematic recruitment oflabour, and private information channels (Feithen, 1985).Whereas knowledge about the determinants of the sending country is based mainlyon one’s own experiences, information about the receiving country can only be gatheredthrough external sources (Gatzweiler, 1975). Personal relationships to relatives and friendsare of utmost importance in obtaining such information (Feithen, 1985). The dominance ofprivate information channels can be explained by the fact that the weight of social andemotional bonds can outweigh other factors when making a migration decision. Treibel7(1999) has argued that one cannot always assess reliability of such information. Thiscircumstance also helps explain the so-called chain migration phenomenon, which is thelarger subsequent migration flows of people who have been informed by previous migrants(Han, 2000). Networks with continuing obligations and expectations may arise through theuse of such personal relationships. The migrant networks resulting from this process helpreduce risks and uncertainties by supplying valuable information (Faist, 1997). The relativelypronounced mobility of highly qualified workers can also be understood in this context:Because they have a comparatively high level of information available to them as well as awide job-search range open to them, they often find it easier to migrate than do workers withaverage skills and education (Janssen, 1998).3.3.Career/Self-employment Opportunities and Improved Professional andSocial StatusIn principle, improvement of professional status can be grouped with the improvement ofsocial status as one reason for migration, because the latter usually follows from the formeras a result of an increase in income (Feithen, 1985). One push factor related to suchprofessional concerns is the lack of advancement opportunities in those sending countriescharacterised as developing countries. In comparison, there is an opportunity to make gainsin professional and social status through migration to developed countries (Blahusch, 1992).One pull factor is the possibility for relatively better on the job training/advanced vocationaltraining in industrialised countries. According to Schipulle (1973), since highly qualifiedpeople have an especially strong desire to improve their status, it is hardly surprising thatthey often name professional career planning as a motive for migration (Körner, 1999).3.4. Salary / Income Situation and Standard of LivingOne complaint of highly qualified workers in sending countries relates to the poor wagesreceived. This aspect represents an important push factor (Körner, 1999), whereas higherincome in industrialised countries functions as a pull factor (Blahusch, 1992). Thecomparatively low income in their countries of origin, in contrast to the high income inindustrialised countries together result in another cause of migration (Breidenbach, 1982).According to Schipulle (1973), as a rule, the difference in income between the developingand the industrialised country must be exceptionally large in order to induce migration. Whatis more, income frequently symbolises a person’s standing and abilities and, as such,represents a measure of his or her accomplishments and success. A high income also leadsto more respect within one’s social sphere (e.g. standard of living).83.5. Hostility Towards ForeignersSocial distance, which can lead to hostility towards foreigners in the receiving country,hinders migration (Gatzweiler, 1975). Through the rise of prejudices against foreigners,xenophobia can be found time and again in alarming situations for the economy, society,politics and culture (Bade, 1994; for an international comparison and evaluation, seeKoopmanns 2001). Such a situation in the target country deters potential migrants, who fearthat they might come to harm during their stay abroad (Thelen, 2000).3.6. Language/CultureFischer and Straubhaar (1998) were the first to describe the value of immobility in asystematic way by drawing from several new hypotheses. They argue that some skills andpart of one’s abilities are location-specific. These internal, country-specific advantages arenot just of an economic nature; rather, they are culturally, linguistically, socially and politicallybinding factors. The effect of these factors and of one’s native country on migration is likethat of a “push factor” preceded by a minus sign. In addition, they deal with advantagesspecific to particular businesses, regions and societies.When the languages of the sending and receiving countries differ, language barriersarise, resulting in a smaller probability of migration (Feithen, 1985). Because mobilitydepends considerably on an individual’s language abilities, which in a figurative sense reflectone’s ability to integrate (Körner, 1999), highly qualified people tend to exhibit a relativelyhigh probability of migration because of the additional linguistic proficiencies they oftenpossess (Janssen, 1998).3.7. Duration of StayThe permitted duration of stay in a receiving country is an important institutionally defineddetermining factor. The different immigration laws of countries can work to discourage orattract migrants. The United States, as the classic immigration country, is a good example ofa pull factor in this regard, whereas Germany, with its non-immigration policies, can beconsidered a push factor. If migrants take this institutional factor into consideration in theirdecision-making process, the likelihood of migration may decrease.4.Empirical Results4.1. Evaluation of the FactorsIn this section we investigate how individual factors might influence the decision of universitystudents to migrate abroad (using several countries as possible choices). Of the 1,5909Figure 1:Career OpportunitiesSalaryStandard of LivingSelf-employmentCultureResidence of Familydistributed questionnaires, 30 could not be included in the results, so that we used a netsample of N = 1,560. In the second section of the questionnaire the participants were askedto indicate on a scale of 1 to 6 the extent to which each of the determinants would influencetheir migration decisions (1 = negligible influence/unimportant criterion; 6 = largeinfluence/important criterion). The six criteria were salary, language/culture, social networks,standard of living, opportunities for self-employment and career opportunities. Theparticipants were first asked to judge the importance of the six criteria on their decision ofwhether or not to migrate, independent of the choice of countries in question.Evaluation of Influencing Factors on Migration Decisions (India)(Irrespective of the effects of the choices of countries on the factorsinfluencing the participants)4.765.815.645.353.963.69Mean value0123456As figure 1 clearly shows, the participants gave career opportunities the highest rating with aresult of 5.8. With a mean value of 5.6, salary is then rated as the second most importantfactor. Standard of living follows in third place with a score of 5.3. As for the remainingcriteria, opportunities for self-employment was placed fourth (4.7), language/culture came innext to last (3.9), with social networks/residence of family in last place (3.6). This last figurereveals that decisions about migration are determined mainly through economicconsiderations and the desire for greater professional and social status.104.2.Ranking of CountriesIn this section of the questionnaire the students were asked to rank the preferred country oftheir choice. They were asked to evaluate the countries irrespective of the determinantsalready given, and to rate each one on a scale from 1 (lowest) to 6 (highest). A total of 1,560cases were available for our analysis; the remaining responses could not be taken intoaccount because of missing information. As shown in figure 2, the respondents indicated thattheir preference lay first and foremost with their native country, India, with a mean value of4.7 — This indicates that the participants of the survey view their home country with a welldeveloped IT sector. The USA/Canada with a mean value of 4.6 was found to be the nextmost preferred country.. In comparison with those who chose North American countries, alower inclination to migrate is found for those individuals who chose Great Britain (3.8) orAustralia (3.7). Finally, the participants’ rating of Germany put it into fifth place with 3.3,before “other countries (mostly the Middle East countries)”, which came in last place.Evaluation of the Ranking of Preferred Countries(Irrespective of the effects of determinants onparticipants' choice of countries)Figure 2:IndiaUSA/CanadaGreat BritainAustraliaGermanyOther012454.3.Consideration of Factors and Country AlternativesAs previously stated, the participants were at first only asked about the determining migrationfactors; in the next section only questions about the countries as possible alternatives wereposed.

Of the 1,590 surveyed, 1,560 decided for one of the sixoptions, resulting in the weighting shown in figure 3.Well over 42.82% would prefer to work in North America (United States/Canada),whereas another 32% do not wish to migrate at all, instead preferring to stay in India uponcompletion of their studies. All the same, 11.73% of those surveyed chose Australia after theUnited States/Canada, leaving Great Britain in third place among the target countries—onlyaround one hundred respondents (6.54%) decided for Great Britain. Germany came insecond to last place with 4.74% (73 respondents). Finally, 2.18% of the participants wishedto migrate to “other countries”.Figure 3:Consideration of factors and Countries as Alternatives (India)31,9942,82Mean valueUSA/CanadaIndiaAustraliaGreat Britain6,54GermanyOther4,742,1811,730510152025303540454.4.Comparison of Mean ValuesIn this sub-section we present a comparison of the mean values in order to show which ofthe eight factors were viewed by the surveyed participants as decisive in their choice of aparticular host country. Table 1 provides the mean values of the eight factors for each of thesix countries. The empirical standard deviations are given in parentheses.4In the first column of table 1, one finds the mean values of the eight criteria for India.Here, career opportunities has the highest mean value with 5.839. If one then compares the4The numbers given as the upper case indicate the ranking of the determinant’s.

The second most important criterion found for the participants in Indiawas salary. For all other remaining countries, they viewed salary as the most importantdeterminant with the highest mean values. Standard of living was given third place for allcountries, and as well played an equally important role for those deciding to stay in India.For India, social networks ranked fourth place, whereas for all the other countries theparticipants viewed this factor as least important (except for Great Britain). Participantsranked opportunity for self-employment in India in fifth place and the fourth most importantcriterion for all other countries considered here.Language/culture was ranked sixth for most countries except USA/Canada and othercountries. For India, duration of stay was ranked seventh by the participants, whereas it wasranked at fifth place for Australia, Germany and Great Britain (USA and Canada at sixthplace). Surprisingly, the influence by tolerance towards foreigners was found to be the leastimportant factor not only for India but also for Great Britain. For all remaining countries(Germany, USA/Canada, Australia and other countries)it was ranked equally in seventhplace.In sum, it can be said that when a decision is made to go abroad, economic reasons(salary, career opportunities and standard of living) usually play a greater role than doinstitutional or socio-political criteria. In comparison, social networks play almost as importanta role in the decision to stay in India.13seirtnuoCrehtOadanaC/ASUniatirBtaerGynamreGailartsuA1 ) 5 ) 8 ) 7 ) 6 ) 3 ) 4 ) 2 )9 9 1 042 ,91,5 (8 723 ,91,4 (5 7,953 ,(9196 ,02,3 (2 2,094 ,(918 756 ,81,4 (5 642 ,02,4 (4 238 ,91 34,5 (1 ) 6 ) 7 ) 8 ) 5 ) 3 ) 4 ) 2 )7 4 6 2 2 6 3 5 1 6 1 43 3,174 ,(0284 ,71,5 (50 ,02,4 (18 ,02,4 (56 ,91,4 (94 ,81,4 (74 ,02,4 (4 4 872 ,71 66,5 (1 ) 5 ) 8 ) 7 ) 6 ) 3 ) 4 ) 2 )5 8 8 8 9 5 3 1 3 1 6 850 ,81,5 (32 ,91,4 (89 ,91,3 (96 ,02,3 (17 ,91,4 (60 ,81,4 (6 941 ,91,4 (2 542 ,81,5 (1 ) 6 ) 8 ) 7 ) 5 ) 3 ) 4 ) 2 )6 1 3 3 5 88 7,235 ,(911 7,923 ,(911 560 ,91,3 (2 185 ,02,3 (94 ,91,3 (41 ,91,4 (7 515 ,02,4 (22 ,91,5 (1 ) 6 ) 8 ) 7 ) 5 ) 3 ) 4 ) 2 )1 1 6 70 8,435 ,(810 692 ,91,3 (6 757 ,91,3 (85 ,02,3 (8 506 ,91,4 (64 ,81,4 (5 2,314 ,(022 7,415 ,(81seulaVnaeMfonosirapmoC:1elba2 ) 6 ) 4 ) 8 ) 7 ) 3 ) 5 ) 1 )ai 4 5In ,575 ,(15d5 0,774 ,(917 1,984 ,(812 5,264 ,(020 936 ,91,4 (7 9,285 ,(513 685 ,81,4 (9 9,835 ,(41erutluC/egaugnayralaotskrwteNlaicsdrawote rc en nra igle reo oE-4oSsogniviLfdradnayatfonoitaru-fleSrofes tit ni etun ymr oo lp pp mseitinutroppOreeraTSLST FDSO ECN TE-51 e0 r1 asnradna3 ts738 e1 thfoa99 ic4 din.sesehtnerapnioitaiveddehT.s’tnanimretedgniknarehtetesacreppuehtsanevigsrebmuneh414.5.Variance Analysis in Comparing Mean Values of Determinants withineach CountryIn this sub-section we investigate whether the mean values of the eight criteria differsignificantly from one another. To this end, variance analyses were carried out for each ofthe six countries5 and the results are presented in table 2. The criterion salary was selectedas the reference category. The coefficients of the remaining factors indicate the difference forthe mean value of salary (X i − X salary ) . T-values are given in parentheses for the hypothesisthat these differences are zero (H 0 : X i − X salary = 0). The F -value given in the last line ofthe table tests the hypothesis that all eight mean values are equal. This can be rejected foreach of the six alternatives at the 1% level.The first column of table 2 shows the comparison of the mean values of the variablesalary with the other criteria for N = 499 individuals who chose India. The mean value forsalary is µs = 5.75; whereas it is µco = 5.84 for career opportunities. The difference for salaryis µco - µs = 0.085. With a t-value of 1.49, this difference is positive but insignificant. Thepositive sign means that those students who chose India evaluated career opportunitieshigher than salary.In this connection it becomes evident that career position does not have the highestpreference for the remaining countries (negative sign, also not significant). However, only forthose individuals who chose India is the difference between career opportunities and salarynot significant at the 1% level (see column 1). In all remaining countries career opportunitieswas viewed significantly lower than salary.This result is not consistent with a qualitative study conducted by Fiedler (2000). Theinterviewees cited better career prospects in their home country as important advantagesover other countries. Furthermore, the participants judged their career prospects withGerman companies not so optimistically. A study by the “Institut der deutschen WirtschaftKöln (2001)” found that it is especially important to almost all foreign IT specialists that theyfind interesting work in Germany. The questions of whether they may further join theireducation at new work place and if the company will offer them good career perspectivesalso played an important role.For those final-year students who chose Germany (column 3), the difference ofstandard of living from salary is –0.825. This is significant with a t-value (–3.60) at the 5%level. The minus sign means that these individuals rate standard of living significantly lower(at the 5% level) than career opportunities and salary. The standard of living factor is rankedthird not only for India (see column 1 of Table 1) but also for the remaining countries.58Model of the variance analysis: Y = µ salary + ∑=2 i β i Di + ε with Y = the vector of all eightcriteria of a country option, Di = dummy for criterion i and β i = µ i − µ salary .15seirt)))n04 )491 )974 )037 )361 )645 )1249 ,*370 .000808 *9 87 0u6 7,42 ,209 7283896o,4 ,5,1 ,,4 ,,3 ,,8 ,,0 ,,0 ,,0 ,0-1 (-1-1 (-2-1 (-1-0 (-0-1 (-0-0 (-0C-1 -(35 (20 0r(ehtOad)* )))))))a** 01 **5 **4 **4 **6 **6 **23 )67 *n6 53 8 04 20 74 66 77 88 20 02 2a521 ,069 .0001,1 ,,8 ,43 96 16 32 69 21 4,1 ,1, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,C-0 (-0/5 61 31 71 71 40 41 50 0- -- -- -- -- -- -3A((((((1 ((SUni)))))a)** )0)*****t*9 **83 )8i7 *6 *2 *2 *9 *5 *6 8r7 30 04 93 58 23 9 00 59 72 16,1 ,4,6 ,4,5 ,3,3 ,2,0 ,776 ,55 .0B,0 ,,5 ,58 6,1 ,1, ,0-0 (-1t1 41 91 91 41 25 20 90 0- 1- 1- 1- 1- -- 1a1 (09-----((e(((((rGseirtn y)** )0))))))*u n7 **7 **6 **2 **1 **13 )45 *8 *5 5ao2 5 02 03 18 81 33 68 39 95 4558 ,50 .0,8 ,6,2 ,4,0 ,3 36 83 92 70 2,1 ,1m, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,C0-0 (-0r-0 -(35 11 51 61 51 41 50 0- -- -- -- -- -n e1 (03((((((iG6h1tiwstnan))a)i4 **4 )00))))i***0 **2 **4 **18 )15 **l4 *9 *0 *9 5a5 27 6m3 31 46 38 51 73 3r643 ,8 0r,8 ,1,5 ,0,0 ,,4 ,65 93 07 51 5t,1 ,1, ,, ,, ,, ,0-0 (-0es1 01 11 2 .5 41 71 70 41 6t0 0- -- 1- 1- -- -- -3 (0u4--(((((e((ADfoseula)))3 **6 )00)))**)*9 **7 **1 **V2 *4 *58 )947 *4 *2 0E-5a9 19 06 5i5 07 26 10 97 7E-591 ,3 0,4 ,6,3 ,1n,7 ,1n ,7 ,99 74 09 3d,00 ,(1,0 ,0, ,, ,, ,0a1 11 13 3 .-0 -(3I 5 90 50 40 50 0- -- 1- 1- -- -4 (06e--((((((Mfono- )lf S ssi)ereSoiS tastgd to itir f.epnrfo ifnr .isuma ffuvkdtmrtiilse (trrw d eoLuo)oo ( Pfit ntCCewp/osi ete) lup ):e re )2e )c )d )nc e)O SS atu ymg S2RN Sr Sn S( ven nare toa ote ol ots lur ou toery nra iga td td tslo li .i .g .eT vaa an .fre ff.le reup pbaLn iff(dc ffs ffjl eta ifoS i(de ia iap m2 dao o- PmT F R (dC (dS (dTS (O ER A N F (This finding also corresponds with a hypothesis from Schipulle (1973), which states that formigrants, income frequently serves as an indication for the abilities of a person, that is, itrepresents a measure of one’s achievements and success. A higher income leads to morerespect within one’s social sphere and/or to a higher standard of living.For Germany, the difference between the mean values of self-employmentopportunities and salary amounts to –1.08, and is significant at the 10% level with a t-valueof –5.28. This implies that the individuals who chose Germany evaluated possible self-employment lower than they did salary, career opportunities and standard of living. For allthe remaining countries, possible self-employment receives fourth place (except for India).This finding confirms the work of Han (2000), who referred to migrants’ observations aboutwhy they normally first venture to make the transition from salaried employee to self-employed entrepreneur only after waiting some years. Reasons given include low wages anda lack of opportunities for advancement.Another factor which influences students’ decisions about migration, and whichshould not be underestimated, is institutional regulations such as the permitted length ofstay. As table 2 shows, the difference between the mean values for duration of stay andsalary comes to –1.292 for Germany, with a t-value of –4.79 indicating significance at the 1%level. This result shows that participants attributed less importance to duration of stay than tosalary and other criteria.The difference between the mean values for language/culture and salary is –1.37.The t-value is significant at the 1% level. Those individuals who chose Germany assessedthe importance of language/culture significantly lower than they did salary. Feithen’shypothesis (1990) that the likelihood of migration decreases when different languages arespoken in the sending and the receiving countries, leading to a language barrier, was notconfirmed through this analysis. With regard to the criteria language, Janssen (1998) hasargued that a relatively high probability of migration predominates among highly qualifiedpersons. Our empirical evidence confirms this theory, for in our analysis the determinantlanguage/culture received a quite low ranking.As expected for Germany, the influence of social networks is lowest in comparisonwith all other determinants (significant at the 1% level). There are only small groups ofmigrants from Southeast Asia in Germany. One noteworthy result for India is that theinfluence of social networks is viewed as important in comparison to salary, with thesignificance of these networks ranked fourth. Otherwise, social networks receives seventhplace for Great Britain (see table 1) and last place for all other countries. For thoseindividuals who wished to seek employment in India, the influence of social networks is notsignificantly smaller than that of salary or career opportunities. The remaining factors play aless important role here (significant at the 1% level). In Fiedler’s study (2001), none of thosesurveyed evaluated social contacts within Germany very highly. Up to now emigrants fromIndia to Germany have had very little opportunity to rely on long-established social networks.17The factor with the least effect when reaching a decision to stay in India was,predictably, hostility towards foreigners. On the other hand, this criterion also had thesmallest influence for Great Britain as well as for all remaining countries, including Germany,for which it was ranked next to last. Our findings do not confirm Gatzweiler’s hypothesis(1975) that social distance, which may lead to xenophobia within the receiving country, has anegative impact on migration.In sum, it can be concluded that the individual criteria are evaluated at a significantlevel for each respective country. For India, career opportunities and salary are considerablymore important in the decision-making process than the other criteria, whereas they are ofless importance for the remaining countries. The remaining decision-making aspects wereclassified as significantly less important (negative co-efficients) for both Germany and theother country options. According to an f- test carried out, the null hypothesis that all meanvalues are equal can be rejected at the 1% level for all of the alternatives.4.6.Comparison of Mean Values of the Deciding Factors between the SixCountriesIn this sub-section further variance analyses are carried out for each of the eightdeterminants in order to ascertain whether the mean values differ to a significant degreebetween the six countries.6The results of the final-year students who chose Germany have been selected as thepoint of reference. The coefficients of the remaining criteria indicate the difference for themean value for Germany (X i − X Germany ). T -values for the hypothesis that these differencesare zero, are given in parentheses (H 0. : X i − X Germany = 0). The f- ratio given in the last linetests the hypothesis that all six mean values are equal, that is to say, that the preferencestructure (ranking of the evaluation of the determinants) of the students does not differsignificantly from each other.The first column of table 3 compares the mean values of the six alternatives for thefactor salary. The mean value for Germany is 5.23; whereas for the United States/Canada itis 5.50. The difference comes to 0.270 with a positive but statistically insignificant t-value(0.04).. This suggests that those who chose the United States/Canada assessed the factor,salary, higher — by an amount of 0.270 — than those who chose Germany. In other words,for the former group, salary is more important than it is for the latter group.This result confirms the well-known differences in income between Germany and the UnitedStates in the IT sector. It also confirms that, when comparing locations, the participants66Model of the variance analysis: Y = µ Germany + ∑=2 i β i Di + εwith Y = vector of one criterionfrom six alternatives, Di = dummy for alternative I and β i = µ i − µ ´Germany .18consider the determinant salary to be very important in reaching a decision. The positiveeffect of salary in a target country on migratory movement, set out numerous times in theoryand confirmed by nearly all empirical studies to date, is found in this study as well.Furthermore, participants who decided for Great Britain evaluated salary higher (t-value notsignificant) than did those who chose Germany. Interesting is that this factor plays a veryimportant role for India (positive and significant co-efficient). This means that those studentswho chose India evaluated salary higher than that for Germany by an amount of 0.52.Furthermore, Breidenbach’s theory (1982), which states that the comparatively low income insource countries and the correspondingly high income in industrialised countries togetherresult in one cause for migration, is not confirmed by our findings.Our analysis confirms the general assumption in Germany that the need to learn theGerman language might have a negative effect on the decision to migrate to Germany. Thefindings reveal that the determinant language/culture is rated considerably higher by thosewho chose the United States/Canada or “other countries” (significant at the 5% level),whereas the coefficient for Great Britain is insignificant for those who chose Germany. Asexpected, Germany has the lowest mean value in this connection (3.92, ranked sixth).What’s more, our results confirm Feithen’s hypothesis (1985) that different languages in thesending and the receiving countries lead to a language barrier and a decreased likelihood ofmigration to that country.The f-test for this criterion can not be rejected at a level of significance (f-test: 3.65).Hence, the equivalence of the mean values can be ruled out to a significant degree, and theuniversity students have no significant preference structure for any particular country. Thissituation tallies with the conclusion reached by Hoffmann (2001) and Wagener (2000) thatthe German language is to some extent viewed as a fundamental problem for thoseinterested in the Green Card. Owing to this language barrier, Germany is to be regarded asthe second to last choice after the English-speaking countries (except USA/Canada). Fiedler(2000), on the other hand, comes to the conclusion that the language barrier is actually quitemodest on the whole, and suggests that the willingness to migrate is high, despite languagebarriers.As expected, social networks was evaluated the highest by those participants whowished to stay in their native India (t-value: 4.66 at the 1% level). Surprisingly, the positivevalues of the coefficients show that network effects are evaluated as more important in theUnited States/Canada, Great Britain and “other countries” than in Germany (t-values areinsignificant). Only a negative value is found for Australia. Social networks play a smaller rolefor those individuals who selected Germany than they do for those who chose one of the19BRD lseir ite nrae truC popOtse niittnu lf-eS yeomrop fro lpmpOEford ga inand ivLtSec tn ie mid res ePe sracn rasd iregneo tow reoTFsl ka ric oo twS eN/eagung ltreuua CLyralaS5 *2 7,2 ,25 0)*4(7 *5 3,1 ,54 9)*5()*3 *1 6,4 ,84 17()*6 *4 3,9 ,53 12(2 *5 4,8 ,03 5)*1()*1 *0 7,6 ,73 81(1 *2 6,9 ,63 0)*2()*8 *3 7,2 ,35 83() )(G uely an va nmar eeG (mseirtnuoCneewtegnidicerofsrotcaFehtfoseulaVnaeMfonosirapmoC:3eie rl tnb ua oT C)4 *1 1,6 ,30 (2)6 *9 4,6 ,30 (247 )91,08 ,(141 )45,04 ,(101 )39,04 ,(0)6 **8 6,3 ,61 4()4 *5 8,8 ,60 (1)6 *1 0,5 ,30 (2)7 *8 2,1 ,30 (2)8 *5 4,1 ,80 (1)3 *3 5,2 ,20 (222 )66,01 ,(0)1 *0 2,0 ,3-0 -(225 )27,0 ,-0 (-001 )47,0 ,-0 (-029 )68,01 ,(079 )45,01 ,(095 )43,02 ,(182 )87,05 ,(072 )37,02 ,(011 )38,01 ,(089 )26,02 ,(0)7 *0 7,4 ,80 (176 )40,02 ,(099 )36,04 ,(048 )70,05 ,(082 )03,05 ,(171 )06,06 ,(012 )07,03 ,(018 )19,05 ,(058 )58,05 ,(090 )42,06 ,(1,01 ,(0 ,95 )45 13 100 0,0 0,02 ,(1 ,86 )60 08 050 0,0 055 )28 09 050 0,01 ,(0 ,,0 0,01 ,(1 ,64 )62 17 130 0,0 0,01 ,(0 ,90 )55 08 050 0,0 0,03 ,(1 ,45 )21 60 560 0,0 0)7 *1 8 1 0,3 ,6 ,0 ,00 (1 0 01 819 )98 36 330 0,01 ,(0 ,,0 0seirtnu )o GCr toteh if.f 2O (d R)6120 ,*049 .00011()5142 ,*420 .00394()5190 ,*529 .00234()* 03 * 00 9 05 ,0 .01 5 0()4197 ,*428 .00002(9 6 01 1 05 , 01 9 .** )01 (0)6140 ,*635 .00072(93 4 05 , 01 1 .** )08 01 (0RtsujdA N -F (P)etseT lvua02s))2Gotia f.d ifIn (dai Gla otr .ts ffu iA (dniait )r GBt torea iff.G (dada )an G/C toA f.fS iU (dother alternative. One should note here that with regard to the question on the presence ofrelatives or friends abroad, the United States/Canada, Great Britain and remaining countrieswere not viewed as significantly important at all.In general, the considerable importance of network effects on migration has beenconfirmed empirically by both micro- and macro-economic studies (see, for example, Bauerand Zimmermann 1995 for an overview). Network effects also proved to be an importantinfluence on migration in a study by Vogler (1999). Furthermore, Fiedler (2000) has shownthat a large share of interviewees who migrated to Germany did not receive their informationfrom relatives or friends, and has, therefore, concluded that there is a lack of personalcontact to people living in Germany. After India, Great Britain is ranked second to last(ranked seventh, see table 1). Significant differences among the six alternatives can befound for this criterion (f-value: 19.16), showing that these university students in their finalyear evaluate this factor differently when comparing specific locations.There are no significant differences between the countries with respect to toleranceshown towards foreigners. Thus, equivalence of mean values cannot be ruled out. Onlythose participants choosing Great Britain, the United States/Canada or “other countries”rated this criterion slightly higher (plus sign, but insignificant co-efficient) than did those whopreferred Germany. Hence, the hypothesis from Gatzweiler (1975), discussed above, is notconfirmed by our findings. As one might expect, university students remaining in Indiaassessed this determinant better than did those deciding for Germany. Amazingly, thiscriterion shows a minus sign (statistically significant) for Australia as well. No significantdifferences between the six country options can be proven for tolerance towards foreigners.In addition, with the exception of India and Great Britain, this determinant was least importantfor all options considered here (ranked last, see table 1). For Germany, Australia and USAand Canada, it was ranked the second to last.The respondents who chose the United States/Canada rated the duration of aresidence permit slightly higher (t-value: 0.73) than did those who decided in favour ofGermany. With the restrictive immigration policy in effect until just recently, foreign universitystudents in Germany, in particular those from developing countries, were obliged to return totheir native country upon completion of their studies. These strict measures have now beenrelaxed, for reasons already discussed in this paper.As expected, the duration of a residency permit for India is less important (t-value of –1.54) than it is for Germany. The participants evaluated this factor as equally important forAustralia and the remaining countries in comparison with Germany. They did not rate thecriterion significantly higher for Great Britain and “other countries” than for Germany. With anf-value of 5.09, the null hypothesis of equivalent mean values can be ruled out for thisdeterminant. Therefore, not much of a difference for this criterion can be shown for the sixcountry options.21With regard to the criterion standard of living, it was evaluated as somewhat moreimportant by the university students who picked India and all remaining countries (t-valuespositive, but insignificant). Hence, our results, to some extent, confirm Feithen’s hypothesis(1985) that an enhanced social status results from increased income, which in turn isachieved through improved occupational status in an industrialised country. A study byFiedler (2000) also demonstrates that the considerations of decision-makers with regard toleaving their native country, above all, have to do with the advantage of improved financialstatus. Yet the merits of better job opportunities and of a higher standard of living, which maycome through emigration and which are closely connected with financial betterment (theformer a precondition and the latter a consequence of one’s financial situation), also receiveconsiderable attention. According to an f-test (f-value: 2.59), equivalence of the mean valuesfor the criterion standard of living can be ruled out; that is, the determinant is evaluateddifferently for the countries under consideration.According to the t-value (significant at 2.34), the criterion opportunities for self-employment is relevant for India. In comparison with the results for Germany, it is alsoimportant for those university students who selected United States/Canada, Australia, GreatBritain or “other countries”. Students who decided in favour of these countries found thepossibility of self-employment somewhat more pertinent: (the co-efficients are positive, butstatistically insignificant). According to Han (2000), empirical surveys show that self-employed migrants generate higher incomes on average, than do those in dependentemployment relationships.Career opportunities in India are of importance: the IT-students, who wished to remainin their native country, found this attribute important (t-value: 2.31 at 5% level ofsignificance). Those who chose Australia assessed the career opportunities there higherthan they did those in Germany. The co-efficients are positive for all countries but statisticallyinsignificant: these individuals rated the career opportunities there higher than they did thosein Germany. This result confirms the hypothesis of Schipulle (1973) and Körner (1999),which holds that highly qualified persons have a strong desire to improve their status andoften experience their own career planning as a pull factor for migration. Equivalence of themean values can be rejected for this criterion at a significance level of 0.000% (f-value: 4.09)and the effects of these determinants differ significantly between the various countries.In sum, those individuals who chose the United States/Canada evaluatedlanguage/culture significantly higher than those students who selected Germany. The othercriteria depict positive but statistically insignificant coefficients indicating more importance forthe North American countries than for Germany. Social networks, self-employment, careeropportunities, salary, language/culture and duration of stay are found more important forIndia than for Germany. Social networks was ranked fourth by those who decided to stay inIndia, in comparison with the other options. Our country comparison showed significantdifferences for the criterion hostility towards foreigners; whereby the mean values for the22other alternatives differ significantly at the 1% level. Hence, the null hypothesis of equivalentmean values can be rejected.5.ConclusionIn this study, we examined the expectations to migrate and the migration decisions amonghighly qualified IT university students in India. By carrying out variance analyses, we testedand analysed the information gained through this on-site survey, which was based on aquestionnaire designed to evaluate the economic and socio-political factors pertaining to thestudents’ migration decisions.Our findings reveal, on the one hand, a relatively high willingness, in general, tomigrate to industrialised countries and on the other hand, a substantial amount of IT-studentswant to stay in their home country. In the detailed questionnaire on country preferences, theparticipants viewed, in addition to their home country, the North American countries (UnitedStates and Canada) as their first choice in every respect. Germany was placed second tolast in the ranking of preferred countries, placed before other countries.A comparison of the mean values for Germany reveals that economic aspects suchas salary, career opportunities, standard of living and the possibility of self-employment areevaluated significantly higher than other institutional or socio-political factors. Particularlynoteworthy is India’s first place ranking with regard to career opportunities, whereas thisdeterminant is placed second for all remaining countries.When evaluating particular factors for each respective country, economic aspects,such as career opportunities, salary and standard of living, are very significant factors for allcountries. The remaining socio-political determinants, such as hostility towards foreigners,duration of residence permit, language and social networks, are viewed as less importantboth for Germany and the other countries considered.The individuals who chose the United States/Canada and Great Britain evaluatedlanguage/culture significantly higher than did those students who chose Germany. There areno significant differences between these countries and Germany with respect to theremaining criteria (coefficients positive but insignificant).Possibilities for self-employment, career opportunities, social networks, salary andlanguage/culture were found to be important for India. For those who wish to stay in India,social networks take first place compared to all others. No significant differences weremeasured in our country comparison for the factor hostility towards foreigners and for theother factors the mean values differ significantly at the 1% level. For their home country IndiaIT-students viewed career opportunities, salary and opportunity for self-employment, socialnetworks and language/culture as the most decisive factors for their migration decision.236.Outlook and ImplicationsIn this analysis the quantification effects of the determinants or elasticities have not yet beenestimated. In future research these effects will be carried out with the help of econometrictechniques, such as discrete choice models.One conclusion to be drawn for economic policy recommendations and implications isthat salary, career opportunities, social networks and language are particularly importantaspects for locations that attract potential migrants. In order to be internationally competitiveand to attract special IT-high potentials, government authorities might also want to consider,in connection with wage policy, whether tax breaks and incentives for the newly arriving ITspecialists, for example covering larger shares of language courses at least for the firstyears, might increase Germany’s attractiveness as a location relative to other industrialisedcountries. As a result of such measures, these highly qualified specialists would then havemore income available. From the current starting salary of EUR 51,000 (a condition of theGreen Card), immigrants must pay for further language courses and higher enrollment costswhen placing their children in German language schools. As is well known, highly qualified ITspecialists earn considerably more in the United States than in Germany. Hence, earnedincome alone provides little incentive for the top talents to come to Germany. On the otherhand, business is expected to pay competitive wages like those in the United States, asituation which up to now would represent a location disadvantage in Germany for small andmedium-sized businesses.Career opportunities was also named as one of the most important reasons formigrating, but it has, as well, been found to be the most important factor for staying in India.Quick integration of persons living here is essential, particularly for those working in high-tech industries. Prospects should be offered for career advancement in various branches ofthe economy so that the best specialists are motivated to produce innovative work forGermany and help create competitive products. Opportunities for advancement should befacilitated in both the private sector and public administrations, and furthermore, thetransition to self-employment could be facilitated for these groups of applicants.The university students who selected the United States/Canada said that theyconsider a permanent visa as an important factor in their decision to migrate. For those ITspecialists who have already arrived in Germany through the Green Card scheme, thisinstitutional barrier — that is, the five-year restriction currently in effect or recently introduced— should be eased for reasons of competitiveness and integration. With the possibility of anindefinite stay, immigrants in Germany will have a more long-term perspective and higherchances of integration. It would then also be possible to build up social networks. In addition,naturalisation could be made easier for foreigners, who have special knowledge and skillsand already live in Germany, in order to ensure better integration.24Language and cultural barriers for new immigrants could be reduced by offeringsupplementary language courses at universities or Goethe-Institutes in the respective sourcecountries. In this way, the migrants could acquire basic language skills early on and bring thisknowledge along, thereby facilitating quick integration.Although hostility towards foreigners was not found to be a significant factor, detailedinformation on the “Green Card” immigrants should be provided to native residents. Thisinformation should clearly explain to the public the predominantly economic reasons for theemployment of IT specialists, and thereby also making the advantages of immigration moreevident to native residents.257.Literature<ref>Bade, K.J.
