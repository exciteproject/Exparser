ABSTRACTConsumer Surplus vs. Welfare Standard in a Political Economy Model of MergerControlby Damien J. Neven and Lars-Hendrik Röller*This paper considers merger control in a common agency framework where firms andtheir competitors can influence the antitrust agency and where transparency – whilemaking lobbying less effective – also implies real resource costs. We examine theperformance of two alternative standards that can be assigned to the antitrust agency inthe presence of these regulatory failures. We find that under a welfare standard,lobbying leads to the clearance of relatively inefficient mergers that decrease welfare(i. e. there is a type II error). By contrast, under a consumer surplus standard, the agencywill ban relatively efficient mergers that would increase welfare (i. e. there is a type Ierror). Lobbying actually reduces the extent to which this occurs, albeit at a cost interms of real resources. We also find that a consumer surplus standard is more attractivewhen mergers are large, when increasing the size of a merger greatly enhances industryprofits, when there is little transparency, and when co-ordination costs amongstcompetitors are low.ZUSAMMENFASSUNGKonsumentenrente vs. Wohlfahrtskriterium in einem polit-ökonomischen Modellder FusionskontrolleIn diesem Beitrag wird die wettbewerbsrechtliche Analyse der Fusionskontrolle miteinem Agency-Ansatz erweitert, in dem Unternehmen die Kartellbehörde beeinflussenkönnen und wo Lobbying Kosten verursacht. Es werden zwei unterschiedlicheEntscheidungskriterien der Fusionsbehörde hinsichtlich ihrer Effizienz untersucht.Benutzt die Fusionsbehörde ein Wohlfahrtskriterium führt Lobbying seitens derUnternehmen zur Genehmigung von ineffiziente Fusionen, was zu einem Sinken derWohlfahrt führt. Andererseits führt das Kriterium der Konsumentenrente zurUntersagung von verhältnismäßig effiziente Fusionen, was die Wohlfahrt ebenfallsreduziert. Daraus ergibt sich, daß eine Berücksichtigung der Anreizstrukturen derUnternehmen die Wettbewerbsbehörde zu beeinflussen, wohlfahrttheoretisch keineeindeutige Betrachtungsweise zuläßt. In diesem Sinne zeigt sich, daß das Kriterium derKonsumentenrente vorteilhafter ist, bei Mega-Fusionen, wenn Fusionen sehr profitablesind, wenn es wenig Transparenz gibt und wenn die Koordinationskosten zwischen dennicht-fusionierenden Unternehmen niedrig sind.*We would like to thank seminar participants at the Graduate Institute of International Studies(Geneva) and the 27th EARIE meeting in Lausanne for comments on a previous version of this paper.1IntroductionThe purpose of this paper is to evaluate alternative objectives that can be assigned toan antitrust agency in charge of merger control. It is striking that some of the majorantitrust agencies actually operate with objectives that diﬀer from welfare maximisa-tion. For instance, Art. 2 of the merger regulation stipulates that the merger task forceshould be solely concerned about restrictions of competition and that eﬃciency beneÞtsshould only be taken into account in so far as consumers are not hurt. Hence, it wouldappear that the merger regulation is concerned about consumer surplus and not aggre-gate welfare. The US antitrust legislation has a similar bias in favour of consumers (seee.g. Gellhorn and Kovacic, 1994).In a world with no regulatory failures, excluding Þrms proÞts from the objectivesassigned to the antitrust authority would seem hard to justify on eﬃciency grounds.However, in the presence of regulatory failures a systematic bias in favour of a particularinterest may occur. In this context, it may be desirable for the public authority (theultimate principal) to manipulate the objective function of the antitrust agency so asto compensate for the bias ex ante. For instance, an explicit emphasis on consumersurplus, possibly a full truncation of the objective of the antitrust agency so that proÞtsare ignored, may be appropriate. That is, decisions taken according to a consumersurplus standard may actually lead to higher welfare than those taken according to awelfare standard.This paper considers the regulatory failures associated with the inßuences that canbe brought to bear on an antitrust agency in charge of merger control1. We considera common agency framework (à la Bernheim and Whinston, 1986) in which interestedparties can provide inducements to the antitrust agency which are contingent on theoutcome of the merger review. We characterise the contingent perks that Þrms willprovide and the decisions that will be taken by the antitrust agency for a distribution ofpossible mergers and for alternative objectives that can be assigned to the agency. Wethen compare the advantages and drawbacks of alternative objectives.In particular, we consider a model with four stages. In the Þrst stage, the governmentdecides on the objective that it will assign to the antitrust agency. We focus on twoalternative objectives, namely welfare and consumer surplus2.1Besanko and Spulber (1993) consider a model where regulatory failures arise from asymmetricinformation regarding the characteristics of the merger, known by the merging Þrms but not the antitrustagency. They also evaluate alternative objective functions that the government might assign to theantitrust agency. They Þnd that the optimal rule should give more weight to consumer surplus thanproÞts.2We focus on these polar cases (rather than consider a continuum of objective functions characterised1In the second stage, a merger is notiÞed and the interested parties provide contin-gent bids. We consider three interested parties, namely consumers, the merging Þrmsand their competitors. However, we assume that consumers are unable to lobby theantitrust agency. This may arise for at least two reasons. First, consumers may notbe well informed about the consequences of proposed mergers and accordingly may notbe able to formulate appropriate contingent bids. Second, consumers may face pro-hibitive transaction costs in representing their interests. These costs could be associatedwith the traditional problems of free-riding and collective action with numerous agents.The assumption that consumers are underrepresented in merger review also seems tobe broadly consistent with casual observation (for instance, consumer organisations areseldom represented in merger hearings).In the third stage, the antitrust agency (the common agent) decides whether or notto allow the proposed mergers on the basis of its assigned objective and the contingentperks by the interested parties (the principals). In line with the literature on politicaleconomy interactions in a common agency framework (see for instance Grossman andHelpman, 1994), we do not explicitly model how the actions of the antitrust agencycould be monitored by the government. Rather, we simply assume that the agencyis subject to imperfect accountability and can compromise the pursuit of its missionwhile responding to perks. Unlike the previous literature, we explicitly consider theeﬀect of accountability. In particular, when the agency is accountable, only a fractionof what Þrms spend in lobbying will aﬀect the agencys behaviour, so that with greateraccountability the agency will be more diﬃcult to inßuence. Moreover, we assume thatthe share of Þrms bid which does not aﬀect the agencys behaviour is pure social waste.This assumption is is meant to represent the fact that with greater transparency inßuencehas to take indirect routes which are typically less eﬃcient than a direct transfer. Forinstance, when bribes can be monitored by the government, inßuences will take placethrough indirect means like expensive lunches or the promise of lucrative jobs in theprivate sectors (the revolving door). Whereas pure transfers do not entail any eﬃciencylosses, indirect means of inßuencing the agency typically involve some real resource cost.Hence, while greater transparency polices the behaviour of the agency, it also involvessome real resource costs. We also assume that lobbying by competitors is relatively lesseﬃcient than lobbying by merging Þrms simply because competitors are more numerousand hence incur some co-ordination cost. As a result we allow for co-ordination costsamongst competitors that are increasing in the number of competing Þrms.In the Þnal stage, product market competition takes place. In equilibrium, Þrmswill thus provide perks anticipating the decision taken by the antitrust agency and theby diﬀerent weights for proÞts) because intermediate cases are presumably hard to implement in practice.2proÞts that will accrue from the outcome of this decision.The proÞts that merging Þrms and their competitors anticipate as a result of anyparticular merger conÞguration are determined by market interactions before and afterthe merger. For our purposes, we do not need to specify the market game explicitly,but rather make some general monotonicity assumptions on the reduced form proÞtfunction of the merging Þrms and their competitors, as well as consumer surplus. Inparticular, we assume that the proÞts of the merging Þrms, the consumer surplus andwelfare increase monotonically with the eﬃciency gains achieved by the merger, whilethe proÞts of competitors decrease monotonically. These assumptions are reasonableand hold for Cournot with homogenous products. We also assume that larger mergersalways enhance industry proÞts but reduce welfare.For both of the agencys objective functions (i.e. welfare and consumer surplus), wecharacterise the equilibrium and the associated welfare (ex post) for a range of possiblemergers characterised by diﬀerent eﬃciency levels. We Þnd that under a welfare standardthe agency will allow relatively ineﬃcient mergers that decreases welfare (there is atype II error). In those circumstances, there is also some social waste associated withlobbying by the merging Þrms and their competitors. By contrast, when the agencyoperates with a consumer surplus standard, it will ban relatively eﬃcient mergers thatwould increase welfare (there is a type I error). In addition, there is range of mergerswhich display even higher eﬃciency which are only allowed because of lobbying. Inthose circumstances, there is some social waste associated with lobbying but no decisionerror. Overall, lobbying still appears to be desirable under a consumer surplus standardbecause lobbying re-balances the objective function of the antitrust agency in favour ofÞrms. Looking at the relative costs and beneÞts of the alternative standards, we observethat a consumer surplus standard is more attractive when mergers are large, whenincreasing the size of a merger greatly enhances industry proÞts, and when transparencyand co-ordination costs are low.We present the model in Section 2 and derive the equilibrium in Section 3. Thecomparative statics with respect to the size of the merger and transparency is presentedin Section 4. Section 5 concludes.2The modelWe consider an industry with N Þrms. A merger in this industry is characterised by thenumber of Þrms involved, M, and by the level of eﬃciency, e, which is achieved by themerged entity. This parameter can be thought of as the reduction of the marginal costaccruing to the merging Þrms.3The structure of the game is illustrated in Figure 1. In stage 1 the governmentassigns a standard to the antitrust agency. It can choose either a welfare standard or aconsumer surplus standard. The objective function of the government is the change intotal welfare (proÞts and consumer surplus) less the waste associated with the lobbyingprocess:W = Πm + Πc + CS − (1 − α)Fm − (1 − α + ε(N − M ))Fc(1)where Πm is the change in aggregate proÞts accruing to the merging Þrms, Πc is thechange in aggregate proÞts to the competing Þrms, CS is the change in consumer surplus,Fm and Fc are the combined bids of the merging parties and the competing Þrms tothe agency, respectively. Note that if the merger is banned, the change in proÞts andconsumer surplus is simply zero.We assume that the process of lobbying involves two types of ineﬃciencies. First, afraction (1 − α) of the bids paid by the merging Þrms and its competitors are wasted.As discussed above, a high share of waste corresponds to an environment with hightransparency so that Þrms have to resort to indirect and ineﬃcient means of inßuencingthe government. Second, we also assume that lobbying by competitors is relatively lesseﬃcient than lobbying by merging Þrms simply because competitors are more numerousand hence incur some co-ordination cost. The waste associated with co-ordination iscaptured by the term ε(N − M ), where we assume that the co-ordination costs areincreasing in the number of competing Þrms3 N − M , i.e. ε0(N − M ) > 0. Let us alsodenote β = α − ε(N − M ) as the share of the bid paid by the competitors which is purewaste.In stage 2, Þrms provide contingent bids to the agency. The objective function of theÞrms are the changes in their net proÞt, namely the change in their proÞt (as deÞnedabove) minus the bids that they provide to the agency.In stage 3, the agency decides whether to allow the merger or not. The agency takesinto account the standard set by the government and the bids by Þrms. Whenever theagency has been given a welfare standard by the government, its objective functions isgiven by,U1 = Πm + Πc + CS + αFm + (α − ε(N − M ))Fc(2)3Note that in this speciÞcation the merging Þrms do not incur any co-ordination costs4In other words, the agency maximises the sum of the change in welfare associated withthe merger and the eﬀective bids (the share of the bid which is not wasted). As discussedabove, we assume that consumers cannot lobby.Alternatively, whenever the agency is endowed with a consumer surplus standard,its objective function is given by,U2 = CS + αFm + (α − ε(N − M ))Fc(3)In stage 4, Þrms compete and proÞts and bids are realised.3The equilibriumWe look for a perfect equilibrium and solve the model by backward induction. Hence,we Þrst consider the equilibrium in stage 4 where Þrms compete.3.1Product market competition in stage 4.Let Π∗m denote the change in aggregate gross equilibrium proÞts of the merging Þrmsand Πc∗ denote the change in aggregate gross equilibrium proÞts of the competitors (thatis the proÞts before bids are deducted), if the merger is realised. If the merger is notallowed, gross proÞts are unaﬀected so that the changes in gross proÞts are zero.We do not explicitly specify the market game but assume that the following propertiesof the proÞt functions as well as consumer surplus hold in equilibrium4:A1: ∂∂Πe∗m > 0, ∂∂Πec∗ < 0, ∂(Π∗m+Πc∗) > 0∂eA2:∂∂CeS > 0A3: ∂(Π∗m+Πc∗+CS∗) < 0∂MA2: ∂(Π∂∗mM+Πc∗) > 0Hence, we assume that the proÞtability of a merger increases with the level of eﬃ-ciency that it can achieve. The proÞts of competitors fall with this level of eﬃciencybut the industry proÞt still rises. We also assume that as the eﬃciency gains increase,the equilibrium price falls so that the consumer surplus increases. These assumptionsimply that welfare increases in line with the eﬃciency gain. It is straightforward but te-dious to check that these properties actually hold for a Cournot model with homogenousproducts.4We also assume that they are continuous and diﬀerentiable.5The last two assumptions restrict our analysis to situations where larger mergersincrease industry proÞts and reduce welfare. These assumptions accord with intuitionand should hold for a wide variety of market models.Beyond our maintained assumptions about the proÞt function A1-A4, we furtherassume that the competitors (whose proÞt fall with eﬃciency) and the consumers (whosesurplus increase with eﬃciency) are indiﬀerent for an identical value of the eﬃciency gaindenoted by e0. In other words, ∃e0 > 0, s.t. Πc∗(e0) = CS∗(e0) = 0. This property does notappear to be unduly restrictive since it accords with intuition that when the equilibriumprice is unaﬀected by the merger, competitors should also be unaﬀected. Again, one cancheck that this property actually holds for a Cournot model with homogenous products(see Bond, 1994). Finally, we assume the merging parties are rational and restrictattention to the range of eﬃciency parameters which ensure that mergers are proÞtable(i.e. such that Π∗m > 0).The impact that a merger has on the interests of merging Þrms, competitors andconsumers under these assumptions is presented graphically in Figure 2, as a functionof the eﬃciency achieved by the merger (holding constant the number of Þrms as well asthe number of merging Þrms). Note that consumers and the competing Þrms never havecongruent interests. When eﬃciency is such that the price increases after the merger,the interests of the merging Þrms and their competitors are aligned. By contrast, wheneﬃciency is large enough to guarantee that the price falls, the merging Þrms beneÞt fromthe mergers and become the allies of consumers, against the interest of competitors.For further reference, it is also useful to deÞne the eﬃciency level which guaranteesthat the change in total welfare is unaﬀected by the merger. Denote the change inwelfare at a given eﬃciency gain by S∼∗(e) = Πc∗(e) + Π∗m(e) + CS∗(e). Note that by∼A1 and A2 S(e) is increasing in e. DeÞne the eﬃciency level at which total welfare isunchanged by the merger as ∼e such that S∼∗(∼e) = 0 (see also Figure 2).Note that the change in welfare at e is positive, since Πc∗(e0) = CS∗(e0) = 0 andΠ∗m(e0) > 0. The last inequality holds, since at an eﬃciency level of e0, price and outputare unaﬀected by the merger. Total revenues are thus unaﬀected but total costs fall inline with the eﬃciency gain so that the change in proÞts has to be positive. Furthermore,given the monotonicity of welfare (through A1 and A2) , we also have that ∼e < e0.Our assumptions with respect to the size of the merger (A3 and A4) can also beillustrated in Figure 2. A4 implies that the sum of Þrms proÞts is shifted upwards forlarger mergers. By A3, consumer surplus is shifted downwards and the eﬃciency levelfor which welfare is unaﬀected (∼e) moves to the right.63.2Decisions by the antitrust authority in stage 3In stage 3 the agency decides on the merger. The decision of the authority is either toban (D = 0) or to allow (D = 1) the merger (no remedies are allowed). In order to avoidunessential complexities, we assume that if the agency is indiﬀerent between allowingand prohibiting a merger, it will decide to allow it. The equilibrium at this stage isstraightforward: the agency simply compares the levels of utility that it achieves undereach outcome and selects the outcome that yields the highest level.Formally, the equilibrium is described as follows. Consider Þrst the welfare standard.In this case, the agencies utility if they allow the merger is given by (2), i.e. U1(D = 1) =Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ + αFm(D = 1) + (α − ε(N − M ))Fc(D = 1). Similarly, the utility if theagency blocks the merger is given by U1(D = 0) = αFm(D = 0) +(α −ε(N −M ))Fc(D =0). For the consumer surplus standard, the agencies utility if they allow the merger isgiven by (3), i.e. U2(D = 1) = CS∗ + αFm(D = 1) + (α − ε(N − M ))Fc(D = 1),while the utility if the agency blocks the merger is given by U2(D = 0) = αFm(D =0) + (α − ε(N − M ))Fc(D = 0). Therefore, the decision by the agency is characterizedby,1 if Ui(D = 1) ≥ Ui(D = 0)D = { 0 otherwise }where i = 1, 2 indicates the welfare and consumer standard respectively.3.3Lobbying decisions at Stage 2We derive equilibrium bids for both welfare and consumer surplus standards. Note thatthe bids are contingent on the actions of the antitrust agency. We therefore need toconsider Þrms incentives to bid against and in favor of the merger being allowed. Webegin with the welfare standard.3.3.1Welfare standardAssume that the agency is assigned the welfare standard. In order to solve for theequilibrium bids, it is convenient to distinguish among various parameter regions withrespect to the eﬃciency level. As noted above, when e < e0, both the merging Þrmsand their competitors beneÞt from the merger and hence will never bid to inßuence theantitrust authority against the merger. We therefore have Fm(D = 0) = Fc(D = 0) = 0.We Þrst consider the Þrms incentives to bid in favor of the merger for regions e ≤ e0.Consider the region where ∼e ≤ e ≤ e0. This is the range of eﬃciency for which mergersdo not increase the consumer surplus but do not reduce welfare.7Lemma 1 Let ∼e ≤ e ≤ e0. Firms will not bid and the merger is allowed.Proof: The agency will allow the merger without any bids, since U1(D = 1) =Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ ≥ U1(D = 0) = 0. Therefore in equilibrium Þrms will not bid. Q.E.D.In this region, the eﬃciency of the merger is such that welfare does not fall. Hence,Þrms do not have to bid in order to inßuence the antitrust agency, which allows themerger without any inducement.Let us now focus on eﬃciency level below ∼e. In this region, the change in welfare isnegative and Þrms (which beneÞt from the merger) will have to provide incentive to theagency if they want the merger to be allowed. Given the decision of the agency in stage3, Þrms will have to ensure that U1(D = 1) ≥ 0. Consider the highest amount that Þrmscan bid, i.e. their entire proÞt. The resulting value of the utility of the agency if themerger is allowed is then given by S1∗(e) = Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ + αΠ∗m + (α − ε(N − M ))Πc∗.Let e∗1 be the eﬃciency level such that such that S1∗(e1∗) = 0.Lemma 2 For e < e∗1, Þrms will not bid and the merger is blocked. For e∗1 ≤ e < ∼e,Þrms bid such that U1(D = 1) = 0 and the merger is allowed.Proof : Note that S1∗(e) is monotonically increasing and continuous in e by A1 andA2. Since S1∗(∼e) > 0, we have that e∗1 < ∼e and that e∗1 is unique and it exists (assumingthat S1∗(e) < 0 for some possibly negative e). Let e < e∗1 such that S1∗(e) < 0, whichimplies that U1(D = 1) < 0 for the maximum bids. Therefore, the merger is blockedand it is optimal for Þrms not to bid. Let e∗1 < e < ∼e, which implies that S1∗(e) > 0.Any pair of bids Fm(D = 1), Fc(D = 1) such that U1(D = 1) = 0 is an equilibrium. Themerger is allowed. Q.E.D.Hence, whenever eﬃciency is insuﬃcient to guarantee that the merger will increasewelfare, Þrms have to provide incentives to the agency in order to have the mergerwaved through. However, the proÞt of the merging Þrms and its competitors increasein line with the level of eﬃciency. There is thus a range of eﬃciency parameter (belowthat which guarantees no change in welfare) for which Þrms have suﬃcient proÞt toprovide adequate incentives to the antitrust agency. In this region, we consequentlyhave two types of ineﬃciencies, which occur simultaneously. The Þrst one arises becausethe merger is pushed through by the lobbying activity of Þrms, even though it reduceswelfare. We therefore have a type II error. In addition, there is bidding in equilibriumand this entails some waste.It is worth noting at this point that the agency does not obtain any rent from thepolitical economy interactions because Þrms always provide just enough incentives tomake the antitrust agency indiﬀerent between allowing and prohibiting the merger. It is8indeed a standard feature of equilibrium in common agency games that the agent obtainspositive rents from the interactions only if the principals have divergent interests (seefor instance Grossman and Helpman, 1994).We now consider the region where the incentives of the Þrms are not aligned, i.e.when e is above e0.Lemma 3 For e > e0, the merger is allowed. In equilibrium the merging Þrms bidFm(D = 1) = max{0, −βΠc∗ − (Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗)}.Proof : Given that competitors are hurt by the merger we must have that Fc(D =1) = 0, which implies that the agency will allow the merger when U1(D = 1) = Π∗m +Πc∗ + CS∗ + αFm(D = 1) ≥ U1(D = 0) = βFc(D = 0). Note that by A1, we have thatΠ∗m > −Πc∗, which implies that in equilibrium Fm(D = 1) < Π∗m, i.e. the merging Þrmsare always able to push the merger through. Assume that Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ < −βΠc∗ sothat competitors could have the merger prohibited in the absence of bid by the mergingÞrms. Fm(D = 1) = −βΠc∗ −(Π∗m +Πc∗ +CS∗) is then a best reply to Fc(D = 0) = −βΠc∗. Fc(D = 0) = −βΠc∗ is a (weak) best reply to Fm(D = 1) = −βΠc∗ − (Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗).In equilibrium, the maximum bid of the competing Þrms is neutralized by the mergingÞrms. Next, assume that Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ > −βΠc∗. Then Fm(D = 1) = 0 is anequilibrium since the maximum bid of the competing Þrms can not block the merger.Furthermore, any contingent bid by competitors Fc(D = 0) is a best reply. Q.E.D.In this region, the level of eﬃciency is such that competitors are harmed by themerger and would want to inßuence the antitrust agency to block it. We therefore haveopposing interests on the part of the Þrms. In principle, the competitors might lose morefrom the mergers than what the merger entails in terms of welfare gains, i.e. is possiblethat Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ < −βΠc∗. In this case, where competitors are badly hurt by amerger, they are capable to compensate the agency for the loss of welfare that wouldarise if the merger is prohibited. However, as the above lemma shows, the merging Þrmsare always able to neutralize the bids by the competitors, which implies that the mergerwill always go through. The agency does not make an error but there is a social costassociated with lobbying. When the maximum bid of the competitors could not overturnthe merger even if the merging Þrms do not bid (Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ < −βΠc∗), the mergingÞrms do not bid and there is no waste.In sum, we Þnd that relative to the adjacent parameter range (i.e. to the left of e0),the emergence of opposing interests among Þrms does not change the outcome of themerger decision, but may introduce lobbying activity, and hence some an ineﬃciency.When there is no interest which dominates, the merging Þrms, which can always trump9the competitors, has to lobby. In this case, the agency obtains some rent from thepolitical economy interaction.We now turn to the alternative standard.3.3.2Consumer surplus standardAssume that the agency is assigned the consumer surplus standard. As before, we Þrstfocus on the parameter region for which Þrms incentives are aligned (e ≤ e0), such thatFm(D = 0) = Fc(D = 0) = 0. We Þrst consider the region such that e ≤ ∼e, i.e. whereeﬃciency is not suﬃcient to guarantee that the change in welfare is positive.Lemma 4 Let e ≤ ∼e. Firms will not bid and the merger is blocked.Proof: The agency will allow the merger iﬀ U2(D = 1) = CS∗ + αFm(D = 1) + (α −ε(N − M ))Fc(D = 1) ≥ 0. This can not hold since Πc∗(e) + Π∗m(e) + CS∗(e) ≤ 0 fore ≤ ∼e. The merger is blocked and it is optimal for Þrms not to bid. Q.E.D.In this region, both the change in consumer surplus and welfare are non-positive.Hence, Þrms do not have suﬃcient resources to compensate the antitrust agency for theloss of consumers surplus that a merger would entail. As a result, Þrms do not bid andthe merger is prohibited.Let us now focus on eﬃciency level above ∼e, such that ∼e < e < e0. In this region, thechange in consumers surplus is still negative and Þrms might be able to provide enoughincentive to the agency in order to get the merger approved. Given the decision of theagency in stage 3, Þrms will have to ensure that U2(D = 1) ≥ 0. Consider the highestamount that Þrms can bid, i.e. their entire proÞt. The resulting value of the utility of theagency if the merger is allowed is then given by S2∗(e) = CS∗ + αΠ∗m + (α − ε(N − M ))Πc∗.Let e∗2 be the eﬃciency level such that S2∗(e∗2) = 0. Note that S2∗(e) is continuous andmonotonically increasing in e by A1 and A2. Since S2∗(∼e) < 0 and S2∗(e0) > 0 it followsthat ∼e < e∗2 < e0 and that it is unique.Lemma 5 For ∼e < e < e∗2 Þrms do not bid and the merger is blocked. For e∗2 ≤ e < e0Þrms bid such that U2(D = 1) = 0 and the merger is allowed.Proof : Let ∼e < e < e∗2. In this case, S2∗(e) < 0, which implies that the merger isblocked even if Þrms bid their entire proÞts. Hence, Þrms will not bid and the mergeris blocked. Let e∗2 ≤ e < e0, which implies that S2∗(e) ≥ 0 . Any pair of bids suchthat Fm(D = 1), Fc(D = 1) such that U2(D = 1) = 0 is an equilibrium. The merger isallowed. Q.E.D.10As eﬃciency increases beyond the level at which welfare is unchanged, proÞts increaseand the harm to consumers falls. There is a region (∼e < e < e∗2) for which the proÞts arestill insuﬃcient to provide adequate incentives to the antitrust agency and the merger isprohibited even though it would increase welfare. In this region, there is a type I errorbut no social waste associated with lobbying. Beyond this level of eﬃciency (e∗2 ≤ e < e0),the merger is allowed but only because Þrms provide adequate inducement, which involvesome social waste. As the eﬃciency level approaches the level for which consumer surplusis unaﬀected, the bids and hence the social waste converge to zero.We now consider the region where the Þrms incentives are not aligned, i.e. such thate is above e0.Lemma 6 For e ≥ e0, the merger is allowed. The merging Þrms bid Fm(D = 1) =max{0, −βΠc∗ − CS∗}Proof : See proof of Lemma 3, which applies mutatis mutandis.In this region, the level of eﬃciency is such that competitors are harmed by themerger and would want to inßuence the antitrust agency to block the merger. In thecase where competitors are badly hurt by a merger (CS∗ < −βΠc∗), they are capableto compensate the agency for the loss in consumer surplus that would arise if the mergeris prohibited. In this case, the merging Þrms, which can always trump the competitors,need to compensate for the maximum bid that competitors can lodge. The agencymake no error in its decision but lobbying leads to social waste and some rent for theantitrust agency. When the maximum bid of competitors cannot compensate for thechange in consumer surplus, the merging Þrms do not need to bid and there is no wasteIn sum, we Þnd (as in the case of the welfare standard) that the merger is alloweddespite opposing interest. Under the consumer surplus standard, the merger is pushedthrough, to the left of e0, by a joint action of the mergers Þrms and their competitors. To the right, the merger might be pushed through again by the action by the mergingÞrms which compensate for that of the competitors. When lobbying is taking place,some ineﬃciency will also arise. Comparing the condition in Lemma 6 with Lemma3, we Þnd that the condition for a wasteful equilibrium to exist is stricter for thewelfare standard. This implies that there exist parameter regions for which equilibriumunder the welfare standard does not involve any bidding, while the equilibrium under theconsumer surplus standard does involve bidding (and therefore waste). The reverse isnot true. In addition, the bid of the merging Þrms under the consumer surplus standard(Fm(D = 1) = −βΠc∗ − CS∗) is always higher than the bid under the welfare standard(Fm(D = 1) = −βΠc − (Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗)).113.3.3The choice of standard in stage 1At this stage, the government decides on the welfare standard in order to maximise (1).Denote W1 and W2 as the equilibrium level of the governments objective function underthe welfare standard and consumer surplus standard respectively. In order to providea benchmark, we also deÞne the maximum level of the governments objective functionthat could be achieved for any e, i.e. the Þrst best denoted by W∧ . Under the Þrst best,the social planner would set waste to zero, which implies no bidding by the Þrms. Fore < ∼e, the merger will be banned so that W∧ = 0. For e ≥ ∼e, mergers will be allowed sothat W∧ = Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗.The next two lemmas characterize the governments objective function under thewelfare and consumer surplus standards. Given the results of Lemma 3 and 6, we willassume that CS∗ > −βΠc∗, which ensures that Þrms will not bid when e > e0 undereither standard.Lemma 7 The governments objective function under the welfare standard is given by 0 if e < e∗1 W1 =  −(Fm + Fc) if e∗1 ≤ e < ∼e Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ if ∼e ≤ eProof : The Þrst and third statements follow directly from respectively Lemma 2 andLemma 1. Consider the second statement; from Lemma 2, it follows that in equilibriumΠ∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ = αFm(D = 1) + (α − ε(N − M ))Fc(D = 1). Using this equality toevaluate (1), the result follows directly. Q.E.D.Lemma 8 The governments objective function under the consumer surplus standard is 0 if e < e∗2 given by W2 =  Π∗m + Πc∗ − Fm − Fc if e∗2 ≤ e < e0 Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗ if e0 ≤ eProof : Follows directly from Lemmata 4 and 5, using (1). Q.E.D.The previous results are further illustrated in Figure 3 which represents the diﬀerencein the objective function of the government under the two rules, i.e. W1 − W2. Wheneﬃciency gains are very small (i.e. e < e∗1), the merger is always banned, no bids are putforward, the two standards are equivalent and yield the Þrst best (i.e. W∧ = W1 = W2 =0).When e∗1 ≤ e < ∼e, mergers are still prevented under the consumer surplus standard,no bids are put forward and the Þrst best is achieved (W∧ = W2 = 0). By contrast, under12the welfare standard, Þrms bid and the merger is allowed. This introduces two types ofineﬃciencies: (i) the merger is allowed even though it yields a negative welfare, so thatthere is a type II error, and (ii) there is waste associated with the bids. The sum ofthe two ineﬃciencies add up to the value of the bids (so that W1 − W2 = −(Fm + Fc)).The reason is that the eﬀective value of the bid (the part which is not wasted) has tocompensate exactly for the loss of welfare in equilibrium. The ineﬃciency, which is theloss of welfare and the wasted part of the bids, is thus equal to the bids. Furthermore,the magnitude of the bids falls as the eﬃciency gains of the merger increase (see Figure3). At e = ∼e, Þrms do not need to bid any longer since the merger does not decreasewelfare.When ∼e ≤ e < e∗2, under the welfare standard Þrms do not bid and the merger is∧allowed so that the Þrst best is achieved (W1 = W = Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗). Under theconsumer surplus standard, the merger is blocked but Þrms do not put forward anybid. There is thus a type I error: a merger which increases welfare is blocked andW1 − W2 = Π∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗. Given that welfare increases in e, the opportunity cost ofnot allowing the merger increases as the eﬃciency gain rises (see Figure 3).When e∗2 ≤ e < e0, under the welfare standard, the Þrst best is achieved. Under theconsumer surplus standard, Þrms bid and the merger is allowed. There is no type Ierror but there is waste associated with bidding, such that W1 − W2 = (1 − α)Fm + (1 −α + ε(N − M ))Fc. Note that for e = e∗2, the entire proÞt is bid and the proportion ofthe proÞt which is not wasted is equal to the loss in consumer surplus. Therefore, thechange in welfare at e∗2 is equal to zero. As a result W1 − W2 is continuous at e = e∗2.Moreover, as eﬃciency gains increase, the waste in bidding falls (down to 0 at e0).Overall, it appears that neither standard dominates over the entire range of param-eters, even though one of the two standards is always Þrst best for any given eﬃciencylevel. Consumer surplus and welfare standard give rise to diﬀerent types of costs de-pending on the eﬃciency level. On the one hand, a number of relatively ineﬃcientmergers  which decrease welfare  are pushed through under a welfare standard. Onthe other hand, some relatively eﬃcient mergers (which would increase welfare) are pro-hibited under the consumer surplus standard. This result accord with intuition; whenthe agency is supposed to consider welfare but Þrms can inßuence the agency, one wouldindeed expect the outcome to be biased in favour of Þrms and against consumers. Witha welfare standard, lobbying activity thus lowers welfare.55Note however that if all interests were equally represented and equally eﬃcient in their lobbying,the welfare standard would not give rise to any error. It is a standard feature of common agency gamesthat when the agent has a welfare standard and the principals bid their marginal beneÞt, the agentmimics the behaviour of an independent agent which would simply maximise welfare (see for instance13By contrast, when the agency defends consumers interest, it will be biased againstthe interest of Þrms and tend to prohibit mergers that enhance welfare. Firms lobbyingactivity will tend to compensate for the narrow objective of the agency and therebyreduce the range of relatively eﬃcient mergers that are prohibited. Without lobbying,all mergers in between ∼e and e0 would be prohibited with a loss in welfare equal toΠ∗m + Πc∗ + CS∗. With lobbying, the welfare loss is strictly smaller for the region betweene∗2 and e0 (see Figure 3). Under the consumer surplus standard, lobbying thus strictlyimproves welfare.A comparison between the two standards over the entire range of parameters canalso be undertaken. However, such a comparison requires an explicit assumption aboutthe distribution of mergers that the agency will face in terms of their eﬃciency level.This distribution is also likely to have a strong inßuence on the eventual outcome ofthe comparison. For instance, it is likely that if the expected population of mergers isbiased in favour of very eﬃcient mergers, the consumer surplus standard will dominate.At the opposite, if the distribution of expected mergers features a high density of ratherineﬃcient mergers, it is likely that a consumer surplus standard will be preferred. Inaddition, an explicit comparison of the two standards would require a speciÞc assumptionabout the distribution of lobbying eﬀorts between merging Þrms and their competitors(given that action by the latter is less eﬃcient than action by the former). Again, thisassumption might matter a great deal for the outcome of the comparison and wouldbe some somewhat arbitrary. Hence, rather than make explicit assumptions aboutthe distribution of expected mergers and the allocation of lobbying eﬀort and derivean explicit comparison between the two standard, we focus on comparative statics. Inparticular, we next examine how the comparison between the two standards would beaﬀected by a change in the eﬃciency of the lobbying process and a change in the size ofthe mergers.Grossman and Helpman, 1994). Hence, if consumers had equally eﬃcient access to the antitrust agency,all welfare enhancing mergers would be allowed in our model and all welfare decreasing mergers wouldbe prohibited. However, the Þrst best would still not be obtained as a potentially large amount of wastewould occur because of lobbying. In addition, if the merging Þrms, the competitors and consumerswere not equally eﬃcient in lobbying or if lobbying entailed some Þxed cost, the equilibrium under thewelfare standard would entail some errors.144The trade-oﬀ between welfare and consumer sur-plus standardsLet us Þrst characterise the trade-oﬀ between the two standards with respect to the eﬃ-ciency of the lobbying process. As discussed above, more transparency in the operationof the anti-trust agency will tend to increase the amount of resources which is wastedin lobbying. In the context of our model, a more eﬃcient process of lobbying is thusassociated with less transparency. An increase in α or a decrease in ε are associatedwith a more eﬃcient process of lobbying.We Þrst characterise (Proposition 1) how the various parameter regions are aﬀectedby a change in α and ε. A full comparison between the two standards, however, needsto consider how the absolute levels of the governments objective function is aﬀected.This will be undertaken in the subsequent proposition.Proposition 1 With a more eﬃcient lobbying process, the eﬃciency region over whichthe consumer surplus standard (CSS) is dominated is unchanged and the eﬃciency regionover which the CSS dominates increases.Proof : By deÞnition of ∼e and e0 and by A1 and the monotonicity of S1∗(.) and S2∗(.),we have that ∂∂eα1∗ < 0, ∂∂eα2∗ < 0, ∂∂∼αe = ∂∂eα0 = 0 and ∂∂eε1∗ > 0, ∂∂eε2∗ > 0, ∂∂∼εe = ∂∂eε0 = 0. Q.E.D.Proposition 1 illustrates that a more eﬃcient lobbying process increases the set ofparameters for which mergers that decrease welfare are pushed through under a welfarestandard (i.e. in between e∗1 and ∼e). This accords with intuition; as a higher share ofproÞt can be used to eﬀectively inßuence the agency, mergers which require marginallymore inßuence over the agency can now be pushed through.By contrast, the eﬃciency of the lobbying process does not aﬀect the range of pa-rameters for which ineﬃcient outcomes occur under a consumer surplus standard, sinceneither ∼e nor e0 are eﬀected by the eﬃciency of the lobbying process. The reason for thisis that the ineﬃcient outcomes near ∼e cannot be pushed through by Þrms. A marginalincrease in eﬃciency does not change this. Also, in the upper limit of the ineﬃciencyregion (near e0) only a marginal amount of resources is necessary to push the mergerthrough at this point and more eﬃcient lobbying does not aﬀect the outcome.Hence, it appears that in terms of parameters ranges, the consumer surplus standardbecomes more attractive than the welfare standard as the eﬃciency of lobbying increases.The next proposition examines how the value of the governments objective functionis aﬀected by more eﬃcient lobbying.15Proposition 2 In the eﬃciency region where the CSS is dominated, the net cost of theCSS is reduced for more eﬃcient lobbying process. When the CSS dominates, the eﬀectof a more eﬃcient lobbying process on the net beneÞt of the CSS is ambiguous.Proof: Let us Þrst consider the region e∗2 ≤ e < e0 . The net cost of the CSS usingthe above Lemmata 7 and 8 is W1 − W2 = (1 − α)Fm + (1 − α + ε(N − M ))Fc. Fromthe equilibrium conditions in stage 2 (Lemma 5) for any e, αFm + (α − ε(N − M ))Fcdoes not change with α (or ε ). Hence, when α increases (or ε falls), Fm + Fc falls.Since (1 − α) and Fm + Fc fall in α (increase in ε ), it follows that W1 − W2 falls in α(increases in ε ). Consider now the region ∼e ≤ e < e∗2. In this region (see Lemmata 7and 8) we have W1 − W2 = Πm + Πc + CS, which is independent of α (or ε ). Since,∂e∗2/∂α < 0 and ∂e∗2/∂ε > 0 by Proposition 1, the Þrst part of the proposition follows.For the second part of the proposition consider the region e∗1 ≤ e < ∼e. We focus on thecomparative statics of α . The proof for ε is analogous. By Proposition 1 ∂e∗1/∂α < 0,so that we Þrst consider e∗1 + ∂e∗1/∂α < e < ∼e. In this region from Lemmata 7 and 8we have W1 − W2 = −Fm − Fc, which is increasing in α by the equilibrium condition inLemma 2. Since, ∂e∗1/∂α < 0, there is a new region where the CSS is dominated, i.e.W1 − W2 < 0. Q.E.D.The Proposition is illustrated in Figure 4 and oﬀers two useful insights. The Þrstinsight relates to the parameter range for which the consumer surplus standard yields anineﬃcient outcome. As discussed, this parameter range is not aﬀected by the eﬃciencyof lobbying. However, Proposition 2 illustrates that the type of ineﬃciency that occursin this range is aﬀected by the eﬃciency of lobbying: as lobbying becomes more eﬃcient,the range of parameter for which a type I errors occurs shrinks and the range of parameterfor which lobbying occurs, and implies some waste, will increase (see Figure 4). In otherwords, as lobbying becomes more eﬃcient, more resources are available at the marginto inßuence the antitrust agency and mergers which require marginally more inßuencecan eﬀectively be pushed through. As a result the range of parameters for which a typeI error occurs shrinks, and more mergers are pushed through.In addition, a type I error always entails a higher eﬃciency loss than lobbying inthis parameter range (see Figure 4 again). The waste associated with lobbying is onlya fraction of the loss entailed by prohibiting the merger which is the entire opportunitycost of the merger in terms of welfare. Hence, a reduction of type I errors will reducethe cost associated with the consumer surplus standard in this area.Consequently, there are two reasons as to why the cost associated with the consumersurplus standard falls when lobbying becomes more eﬃcient. First, more eﬃcient lob-bying implies that fewer resources are wasted for any eﬃciency level for which lobbying16occurs. Second, more eﬃcient lobbying also reduces the range of parameters for which atype I error occurs and this reduces the cost of the consumer surplus standard becausefor any eﬃciency level, a type I error is more costly than the waste associated withsuccessful lobbying. This result which will be useful for further reference is collected inLemma 9.Lemma 9 In the eﬃciency region where the CSS is dominated, the net cost of the CSSincreases in e∗2, holding ∼e and e0 constant.Proof: Follows from Proposition 2.The second insight oﬀered by Proposition 2 relates to the parameter region wheremergers that decrease welfare are pushed through by lobbying under the welfare stan-dard. As discussed above, more eﬃcient lobbying (less transparency) extends the rangeof mergers for which a type II error occurs under the welfare standard. At the sametime, for any value of the eﬃciency parameter for which the merger is pushed through,less resources are wasted in inßuencing the government (see Figure 4). As a result theimpact of more eﬃcient lobbying is ambiguous. This trade-oﬀ also illustrates the eﬀectof transparency. On the one hand, transparency is desirable because it will reduce thescope of undesirable deals that Þrms can manage to push through. On the other hand,transparency is undesirable because it imposes a constraint on Þrms that they can onlycircumvent at great cost.We next characterise the trade-oﬀ with respect to market structure.Proposition 3 The larger the size of the merger, the larger the eﬃciency region overwhich the CSS dominates, and the larger the eﬃciency region over which the CSS isdominated. Moreover, when the CSS is dominated, the eﬃciency regions for which TypeI errors occur shrinks relative to the eﬃciency region for which waste occurs.Proof: We Þrst consider the region where the CSS dominates. Note that A3 can be∼written as ∂S∗/∂M < 0. The deÞnition of ∼e then implies that ∂ ∼e/∂M > 0 , i.e. ∼e movesto the right (see also Figure 5). If ∂S1∗/∂M > 0 (i.e. when merger size has a strongeﬀect on industry proÞts), then ∂e∗1/∂M < 0, which implies that the region is gettinglarger. If ∂S1/∂M < 0, then ∂e∗1/∂M > 0, i.e. e∗1 moves to the right. By A3 and A4 and∼ ∼since ε0(N − M ) > 0, we have ∂S1∗/∂M > ∂S∗/∂M . Since ∂S1∗/∂e > ∂S∗/∂e it followsthat ∂ ∼e/∂M > ∂e∗1/∂M , i.e. the function that has e∗1 as a Þxed point shifts by less andis steeper than the function, which has ∼e as a Þxed point, so that ∼e moves faster to theright than e∗1 as M increases. We next consider the region where the CSS is dominated.17∼We Þrst show that this area increases. By A3 and A4 we have ∂CS∗/∂M < ∂S∗/∂M .∼Since ∂CS∗/∂e < ∂S∗/∂e it follows that ∂ ∼e/∂M < ∂e0/∂M , i.e. the function thathas e0 as a Þxed point shifts more and is ßatter than the function, which has ∼e as aÞxed point, so that ∼e moves less to the right than e0 as M increases. We now show thelast statement of the proposition. By A3 and A4 and since ε0(N − M ) > 0, we have∂S2∗/∂M > ∂CS∗/∂M . Since ∂S2∗/∂e > ∂CS∗/∂e it follows that ∂e0/∂M > ∂e∗2/∂M ,i.e. e0 moves faster to the right than e∗2 as M increases. Q.E.D.Proposition 3 indicates that in the presence of larger mergers, both standards performrelatively worse, to the extent that the range of parameters for which either standardyields ineﬃcient outcomes increases.Consider those mergers which reduce welfare but are pushed through under the wel-fare standard. Larger mergers tend to reduce welfare for any level of the eﬃciencyparameter, so that in principle Þrms have to provide more inducement in order to pushthem through (i.e. ∼e moves right - see Figure 5). However, larger mergers also enhancethe proÞts that are available to provide inducement to the agency. Under the assump-tions of our model6, the latter eﬀect always dominates the former so that the range ofparameters for which ineﬃcient mergers are pushed through increases.Proposition 3 also illustrates that increasing the size of a merger does not necessarilylead to more regulatory clearance. When increasing the size of mergers has a strongeﬀect on the industry proÞts, more precisely when ∂∂SM1∗ > 0, then e∗1 moves left (see theproof of proposition 3), regulatory clearance will never be jeopardised by larger mergers.However, when the eﬀect of larger mergers on industry proÞts is smaller, more precisely∂∂SM1∗ < 0, then e∗1 moves right but by less than ∼e. In this case, there will be a range ofeﬃciency parameters for which regulatory clearance will be jeopardised as the mergerbecomes larger.Consider the range of eﬃciency parameters for which the consumer surplus standardyields an ineﬃcient outcome. As mergers become larger, both welfare and consumersurplus are reduced (so that both ∼e and e0 shift right). Under the assumptions of ourmodel, the eﬀect on consumer surplus is greater than the eﬀect on welfare so the rangeof parameter for which the consumer surplus standard yields an ineﬃcient outcomeincreases (e0 moves further to the right than ∼e). However, Proposition 3 also shows (seethe proof) that e0 moves further to the right than e∗2, which implies that the relativesize of the regions for which a type I error occurs under the consumer surplus standard6It follows from the fact that welfare is less aﬀected by eﬃciency than industry proÞts and by thefact that welfare is an average of proÞt (which increase with merger size) and consumer surplus (whichdecreases with merger size).18tends to shrink relative to the region for which there is wasteful lobbying. The reasonis as follows: when the size of the mergers increases, consumers surplus fall and moreinducement has to provided to the agency. However, industry proÞts also increase sothat more inducement is available. As before, under the assumptions of our model7,the latter eﬀect dominates the former and the range of parameter for which successfullobbying arises increases. As a consequence, the range of parameter for which a typeI error occurs will shrink relative to the range for which successful  but wasteful lobbying arises.Having considered how the ranges of eﬃciency parameters for either standard is inef-Þcient change with merger size, the next propositions analyses how merger size changesthe relative costs and beneÞts of the two standards.Proposition 4 When the CSS dominates, larger mergers increase the net beneÞt of theCSS standard, whenever ∂∂SM1∗ > 0, i.e. when increasing merger size has a strong eﬀecton industry proÞts.Proof: Consider the region where the CSS dominates. By A3 and Lemma 2, we knowthat Fm+Fc increases in M . Using Lemmata 7 and 8, it follows that ∂(W1−W2)/∂M < 0in this region. When ∂∂SM1∗ > 0 , e∗1 moves left and the net beneÞt of the CSS increases.Q.E.D.The intuition behind this proposition is straightforward. As discussed above, whenincreasing the size of mergers has a strong eﬀect on industry proÞts, it will never jeop-ardise regulatory clearance. In other words, the range of eﬃciency parameters for whichthe mergers are pushed through with a given merger size includes the set of eﬃciencyparameters for which the mergers are pushed through with any lower merger size. Inaddition, for any value of the eﬃciency parameter, a larger merger size implies that thetype II error is more costly and that a stronger inducement (hence more waste) has tobe provided to the agency to push the merger through. In those circumstances, the costof the welfare standard it thus unambiguously greater.When increasing the size of mergers has a weaker eﬀect on industry proÞts, thematter is less clear. In those circumstances e∗1 moves right, and some larger mergers(with low eﬃciency) are blocked, which is Þrst best.Proposition 5 When the CSS is dominated the eﬀect of larger mergers on the net costof the CSS is ambiguous. However, the CSS is more attractive with larger mergerswhenever the lobbying is eﬃcient, and when marginal co-ordination costs are high.7It follows from the fact that consumer surplus is less aﬀected by eﬃciency than industry proÞts andby the fact that welfare is an average of proÞt (which increase with merger size) and consumer surplus(which decreases with merger size).19Proof : Note that ∂ ∼e/∂M and ∂e0/∂M are unaﬀected by α, β, and ε0. Further notethat ∂S2∗/∂M is increasing in α, β, and ε0 which implies that ∂2e∗2/∂M ∂α, ∂2e∗2/∂M ∂β,and ∂2e∗2/∂M ∂ε0 are negative. The result follows then from Lemma 9. Q.E.D.Proposition 5 conÞrms that the eﬀect of merger size on the cost of the consumersurplus standard is ambiguous. This should not come as a surprise given that increasingthe merger size both increases and shifts rightward the range of parameters for whichthe consumer surplus standard yields an ineﬃcient outcome.The second part of the proposition uncovers a complementarity between merger sizeand the eﬃciency of the lobbying process: the eﬀect of merger size on the range overwhich the consumer surplus standard yields ineﬃcient outcomes is unaﬀected by theeﬃciency of lobbying. But the eﬀect of merger size on the region over which a typeI error occurs within that range is negatively inßuenced by the eﬃciency of lobbying.The more eﬃcient the lobbying, the more the region over which type I errors occurs willshrink when merger size increases. Hence, not only does lobbying reduce the cost of theconsumer surplus standard on it own right (see above), but it also make the consumersurplus standard more attractive when merger size increases.Collecting the above results, we Þnd that eﬃcient lobbying and large mergers rein-force each other in reducing the cost the consumer surplus standard in regions where ityields an ineﬃcient outcome. Where the welfare standard yields ineﬃcient outcomes,large mergers make matters worse independently of the eﬃciency of lobbying (at leastwhen larger mergers have a strong eﬀect on industry proÞts).5ConclusionThis paper evaluates alternative rules that can be assigned to a merger control agencywhich can be inßuenced by interested parties. We Þnd that neither a welfare standard nora consumer surplus standard dominates. The consumer surplus and welfare standard alsogive rise to diﬀerent types of ineﬃciencies: relatively ineﬃcient mergers  which decreasewelfare  are pushed through under a welfare standard, while relatively eﬃcient mergers(which would increase welfare) are prohibited under the consumer surplus standard.While lobbying activity is undesirable under a welfare standard, it raises welfare undera consumer surplus standard.The process of lobbying - as characterized by transparency and co-ordination costs -is shown to be important in terms of the relative performance of the two standards. Bothtransparency as well as co-ordination costs make lobbying less eﬀective. Under a welfarestandard this has two eﬀects. On the one hand, it will reduce the scope of undesirabledeals that Þrms can manage to push through. On the other hand, transparency and20co-ordination costs impose a constraint that Þrms can only circumvent at a cost. Bycontrast, transparency or co-ordination costs do not aﬀect the scope of deals for whicha consumer surplus standard is ineﬃcient. It only aﬀects the balance between wrongdecisions and waste in lobbying. For instance, more transparency actually shift thebalance towards wrong decisions because it reduces Þrmss eﬀectiveness in lobbying.Since wrong decisions are socially more costly than lobbying, transparency is actuallynot desirable under a consumer surplus standard.We also Þnd that the size of the proposed merger has a diﬀerent impact on theperformance of the two standards. Under the welfare standard, there are two eﬀects.On the one hand, larger mergers, which have more resources to lobby the agency, manageto push more numerous deals through, despite the fact that larger deals are also lessdesirable in terms of welfare (and hence require more lobbying to be pushed through).On the other hand, the deals that are pushed through may on average be less damagingso that the overall eﬀect is ambiguous. Still, when industry proÞts are strongly aﬀectedby the size of the merger, the former eﬀect will dominate and the welfare standard willperform relatively worse.The matter is diﬀerent for a consumer surplus standard. The range of deals for whichineﬃcient outcomes arise increases with larger mergers. But larger mergers also tend toshift the balance away from wrong decisions and in favour of wasteful lobbying (becauseÞrms have more resources). As result, the performance of the consumer surplus standardis not unambiguously worse with larger mergers. In addition, we observe that largermergers will shift the balance away from decisions errors more Þrmly when transparencyis low. Hence, low transparency and larger mergers are circumstances that reinforceeach other in making a consumer surplus standard more attractive.These Þndings suggest that a reform of the standard that is assigned to a competitionagency needs to consider the institutional environment in which the agency operates andthe population of cases that the agency is likely to consider. For instance, it may notbe appropriate for the EU to move towards a welfare standard unless the transparencyof its procedure is greatly improved. The average size of proposed mergers has beenunusually large in the recent merger wave (see European Economy, 1999). If one expectsthis feature to persist, our analysis would imply that maintaining a consumer surplusstandard may be appropriate.21References<ref>Besanko, D. and D.
