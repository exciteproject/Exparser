As the latest in a long line of sympathetic vampires, Spike’s textualconstruction rearticulates the dualities which fictional vampires have longembodied: the simultaneous expression of erotic repulsion and attraction;a fear of and desire for the ‘Other’; the ambivalences of a troubling ontol-ogy figured through a creature that is neither dead nor alive. As NinaAuerbach has stated: ‘Vampires are neither inhuman nor nonhuman norall-too-human; they are simply more alive than they should be’ (1995: 6).Like his fictional ancestors, Spike blurs boundaries and raises ambiguities,but he does so in a manner firmly located in today’s cultural landscape.Spike joins Buffy the Vampire Slayer in Season 2 with a swagger and avulnerability which alludes to the many oppositions that he will come tounsettle. Spike is polymorphous: he is both man and monster, bothmasculine and feminine; and his increasingly fractured self underminesthe Manichaean struggle which is central to so much of today’s popularculture.Spike’s character also raised important questions about the boundariesof the text. Our understanding of Spike depends upon a number of extra-textual factors: intertextual pop culture references; allusions to musicalsubcultures; and knowledge of the actor James Marsters, who plays him.Spike has spawned a huge fan culture and his audience appeal suggeststhat he articulates a number of cultural issues, of which this special issue       ’                                           8 ( 3 )examines several in depth. However, in this introduction we would like toprovide some contextual background to the television show in which Spikecomes to such prominence, and offer a way into the text for thoseunfamiliar with it.Buffy the Vampire Slayer (aka Buffy or BtVS) first appeared in 1992 asa film. It was written by Joss Whedon, directed by Fran Rubel Kuzui andstarted Kristy Swanson as the eponymous heroine – high-school studentby day, but vampire slayer by night. The film was not a huge success, butin 1997 the character of Buffy returned to TV (played by Sarah MichelleGellar) and became a huge hit. This time Joss Whedon was more firmlyin control as creator, executive producer and (on occasion) writer anddirector. In the words of Jane Espenson, one of the show’s writers, ‘it is soJoss’s show’ (2004: 101), and it is his creative vision that has to be held toaccount for the success of the TV show when the film had made such littleimpact.Whedon has argued that it was always his intention that Buffy shouldbecome an iconic show. In an oft-quoted interview he said:I designed the show to create that strong reaction. I designed Buffy to be anicon, to be an emotional experience, to be loved in a way that other shows can’tbe loved. Because it’s about adolescence, which is the most important thingpeople go through in their development, becoming an adult. And it mythol-ogizes it in such a way, such a romantic way – it basically says, ‘Everybody whomade it through adolescence is a hero.’ And I think that’s very personal, thatpeople get something from that that’s very real. (quoted in Lavery, 2004: 4)Within the world of cult TV Whedon has become regarded as genius/auteur (Lavery, 2002) helming not only Buffy (1997–2003), but its spin-offseries Angel (1999–2004) and the ill-fated Firefly (2002). All three serieshave received critical acclaim and have become the subject of fan devotion.At the beginning of 2005, the website Buffysearch.com listed a total of3973 sites dedicated to Buffy and Angel, including 1094 general BtVS sites,627 sites featuring fan fiction from the two series and 612 sites focusing onthe cast. Of these, 68 focus on Spike and/or James Marsters, with onlyBuffy and/or Sarah Michelle Gellar herself having more fan sites.In addition, Whedon’s work has attracted considerable academicattention. Speaking at the 2004 Slayage Conference on Buffy the VampireSlayer, David Lavery (co-editor of the first academic book on Buffy –Fighting the Forces: What’s at Stake in Buffy the Vampire Slayer) claimedthat ‘Buffy studies’ ‘comprised at least fifty disciplines, methods, and/orapproaches’ and Sue Turnbull (2004) has noted that there are at least 12serious academic books on Buffy and an (online) international journal.There have already been three international conferences on the show, inthe UK, Australia and the US. This year will see a further conference heldat the Centre for Constructions and Identities at the University of276 Huddersfield on ‘Social Life, Human Experience and the Works of Joss   -                   :       ’            Whedon’ and a 2006 conference, again focusing on the oeuvre of Whedon,is to be held in Nashville, TN.Despite the demise of Buffy in 2003 (after seven seasons and a total of144 episodes) and Angel in 2004 (after five seasons and 110 episodes),interest in both shows and their characters remains unabated and theshow is an ongoing, international phenomenon. In fact, in the US, revenuecreation and audience interest in TV shows only begins with the networkrun, which is followed by syndication and then sales of DVDs, videos andrelated merchandise. Today in the US Buffy the Vampire Slayer reruns areshown twice a week in syndication on the cable channel FX and numerouslocal affiliates. Indeed, according to Nielsen ratings, the weekend debut ofBuffy the Vampire Slayer in broadcast syndication in October 2001 wasthe highest rating premiere of an off-network weekly rerun since ER in1998.1Furthermore, reruns currently air on terrestrial, cable and satellitechannels in over a dozen European countries, a number of Latin Americanand South American countries, and at least one Arab TV channel. Theshow continues to be a thriving source of licensing and merchandisingrevenue, with large numbers of websites selling everything from DVDs,video games, posters, photos, stickers, patches and jewellery, to life-sizecardboard stand-up figures of the show’s stars, mobile phone ringtones,stationery sets, spin-off novels, guidebooks and fridge magnets. Both Buffythe Vampire Slayer and Angel continue to be important players in themedia world and audience interest in both shows and their charactersremains high.Buffy (and Spike) for beginnersBut what exactly is Buffy the Vampire Slayer? Apart from the reasons givenby Joss Whedon that we have quoted, why did the show become such aphenomenal success? As stated in the show’s title, Buffy herself is the‘vampire slayer’. In the mythology of the series, this means that she is theone girl who has been chosen to defend the world: as the opening voiceoverto many of the early episodes states, ‘She alone will stand against thevampires, the demons and the forces of darkness’. Yet the voiceover ismisleading – for Buffy is not alone. Unlike earlier Slayers, Buffy breaksthe mould by having a range of friends and allies who help her in herfight. From the outset she has loyal friends – Willow and Xander. Thesetwo form the core of the group known in the ‘Buffyverse’ (the colloquialterm used to describe the diegetic world of Buffy) as the Scooby Gang, or‘Scoobies’, in homage to the TV show Scooby Doo (premiered 1969). Overthe course of the seven seasons of the show additional characters come andgo, including Cordelia, Oz, Riley, Anya and Tara. In Season 5 Buffy alsoacquires a sister, Dawn. In addition to these characters, Buffy is able to callon the services of a mentor, Rupert Giles (generally known as Giles) sent 277                               8 ( 3 )by the Council of Watchers (a mysterious organization that oversees theworld of the vampire slayer).There is also Angel, a vampire since the mid-1700s who, at the end ofthe 19th century, is cursed by gypsies with a soul that leads him to repentof his evil-doing and to side with Buffy. Of course in the ‘Buffyverse’ (asin all serial TV, which relies on long drawn-out story arcs) things are neverthis simple. Each season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer generally revolvesaround a drawn-out battle between Buffy and the Scoobies and one majorenemy (known in ‘Buffyspeak’ as the ‘Big Bad’).2 In Season 2 (1997–8) theBig Bad turns out to be Angel who, having experienced a ‘moment of truehappiness’ through sex with Buffy, loses his soul and turns on Buffy andher friends.3 However, Angel does not turn into Buffy’s nemesis until partway through the season (episode 14).4 For the first part of the seasonviewers are misled into thinking that Buffy’s key enemy this year is to beanother vampire – Spike. Spike’s evolving role in this season marks hismove from one of the show’s expendable adversaries to one of its centraland most enduring characters (see Hills and Williams, in this issue, formore on Spike’s transition from guest appearance to regular cast member).Spike’s first appearance is in the episode ‘School Hard’ (2:3). He isshown arriving in Sunnydale with his long-time girlfriend (and fellow-vampire) Drusilla. According to the narrative, Drusilla is weak, havingbeen set upon by a mob in Prague, and Spike has brought her to Sunnydale(which in the mythology of the show has been built over the Hellmouth,the site of convergence for a range of evil and mystical forces) in order torestore her to health. From the very beginning we are told that there is aconnection between the two vampires Angel and Spike, with Spikedescribing Angel as his sire, ‘You were my sire, man! You were my . . .Yoda’5 (see below for the way that the series rewrites their history). AsSpike was intended only as a temporary villain he is inactive for much ofthe latter part of Season 2, coming to prominence only in the final twoepisodes when he helps Buffy to defeat the now-evil Angel (who, when hereverts to his original vampire ego, takes the name of Angelus). Spikeappears in only one episode of Season 3, but returns as a key characterfrom Season 4 onwards when he becomes the main vampire character(Angel having departed for his own show). And when Buffy finallyfinishes its seven-year run in 2003, Spike migrates to the spin-off showAngel for its final year.Spike’s story arc in Buffy is compelling, and as the show progresses wefind out more about his history (shown to the audience through the use offlashback). William, Spike’s human incarnation, was born into a middle-class Victorian household. As we find out from the episodes ‘Fool for Love’(5:7) and ‘Lies My Parents Told Me’ (7:17) he was shy and retiring, fond(perhaps overly fond) of his mother, and given to writing ‘bloody awful’poetry – much of it dedicated to his unrequited love for Cecily. One278 evening in 1880, after being rejected by Cecily, who has told him that she   -                   :       ’            can never love him because he is her social inferior, he ventures into thestreet where he is lured into an alley by the vampire Drusilla. In thisflashback it is Drusilla who (in a revision of the storyline from Season 2)sires him. Free of his mortal incarnation, William reinvents himself as‘Spike’, adopting a working-class persona and becoming a fearsome killer.Over the course of more than 100 years he makes himself the scourge ofEurope, and manages to kill two of Buffy’s Slayer predecessors – one in1900 during the Boxer Rebellion in China and another in New York in1977.However, Spike’s murderous persona begins to alter slowly in relationto Buffy, initially in Season 2 when, for personal reasons, he helps herdefeat the evil Angelus. His permanent return to the show in Season 4 seesSpike rendered harmless to humans when a covert group of governmentoperatives (the ‘Initiative’) implant a ‘chip’ in his brain which preventsSpike from harming humans. He finds, however, that the chip does notprevent him harming other demons and vampires so, as an outlet for hisviolence, he finds himself an unlikely ally to Buffy and the Scoobies. BySeason 5 he has fallen in love with Buffy although, not surprisingly, hisaffection is not returned (in an echo of his relationship with Cecily, Buffytells Spike he is beneath her). By the end of Season 5 he is willing to givehis life to save Buffy and her sister Dawn, but it is Buffy who makes thissacrifice and dies.Resurrected in Season 6 (brought back from the dead by a spell fromWillow, who has become a powerful Wicca) Buffy finds herself increas-ingly isolated from her friends and turns to Spike for comfort, embarkingon a passionate but soulless relationship. When she finally renounces thisrelationship Spike endeavours to re-ignite it, but ends up attempting torape her. This act provokes a crisis of conscience that results in Spikedeparting for Africa where, after a series of trials, he is able to win back hissoul (see Abbott, in this issue, for more on the ambiguity surrounding thisdevelopment). Season 7 sees the newly-ensouled Spike return toSunnydale and attempt to rebuild his relationship with the Slayer, onceagain fighting at her side as she faces the greatest challenge of her life – abattle against the ‘First Evil’. The season ends with Spike sacrificing hislife to save the world. If this echoes Buffy’s sacrifice at the end of Season 5then his return on the spin-off show Angel echoes her resurrection (seeWilcox (2002) for a more detailed analysis of parallels between Spike andBuffy). In the early episodes of Angel Season 5, Spike is quite literally aghost of his former self. But recorporealized he joins Angel’s side in, onceagain, fighting evil (albeit reluctantly). The final episode of the finalseries of Angel (‘Not Fade Away’, A5:22) sees Spike in an alley alongsideAngel facing seemingly insuperable odds. The show ends as the battle isabout to commence – Spike’s ultimate fate remains unknown.Spike’s character progression (or ‘arc’ as Whedon and his scriptwritersprefer) throughout Buffy the Vampire Slayer comes to represent the show’s 279                               8 ( 3 )key themes of angst and outsiderdom perhaps more fully than that of anyother character. All of the central characters in Buffy the Vampire Slayerare, as Roz Kaveney (2004: 7) puts it, ‘refugees from hierarchy of one sortor another’. Buffy’s best friend Willow is a high-school geek turnedWiccan, who has a lesbian relationship with Tara, herself an exile from anoppressive patriarchal family. The other prominent (and permanent)character in the Scooby Gang, Xander, is depicted as a ‘loser’ both in termsof his high-school experience and his masculine identity. He eventuallyfinds love with a fallen vengeance demon, Anya, only to abandon her atthe altar. Even Buffy herself, locked into a role as the Slayer which isbeyond her control, is depicted as an outcast. Buffy the Vampire Slayer isconcerned centrally with the issue of outsiderdom, both in terms of itscharacter portrayal and in individual episodes (‘Out of Sight, Out of Mind[a.k.a. Invisible Girl]’, 1:11; ‘Earshot’, 3:18). However, it is Spike whoexpresses this marginality most completely, as even members of theScooby Gang generally want nothing to do with him. He is, in effect, theoutcast’s outcast.Not only does Spike express the marginality associated with thefictional vampire more generally (neither dead nor alive, a figure on theedges of humanity), he is an outcast in a fictional world that otherwiseembraces marginal social identities, and in a show that speaks to and fromthe experience of outsiderdom. Shunned even by the Scoobies – them-selves social outcasts – Spike suffers an extreme form of outsiderdom andmarginality. This may partly explain the tremendous interest in thisfigure and the enormous fandom which surrounds him, for Spike’scharacter fully articulates that which makes Buffy the Vampire Slayer sucha cult success – the experience of the outcast and the pain of liminality, ofnot belonging. Williamson (in this issue) will explore this aspect of theshow’s, and in particular Spike’s, appeal in more depth.Buffy – unsettling the codes of representationBuffy the Vampire Slayer may have started out as teen TV dealing with thetrials of adolescence, but – as the number of books and articles that theshow has generated testifies – quickly transcended this generic label todevelop a cult following among audiences of all ages. Perhaps the keyreason for this is that while, at its literal level, it functions as a coming-of-age story about a girl with superpowers, at the metaphorical level it dealswith many of the fundamental themes of existence that haunt the post-modern condition (see, for example, South, 2003; Wilcox and Lavery,2002; and the numerous contributions to the online journal Slayage;http://www.slayage.tv). Jean-Francois Lyotard (1984: xxiv) has summedup the postmodern condition as ‘incredulity toward metanarrative’, andcertainly metanarratives of good and evil, the human and the monstrous,280 the clear distinction between right and wrong, all are disrupted   -                   :       ’            systematically in a show that is formally structured around ‘good’ versus‘evil’. Each of the Scoobies in some way blurs these distinctions (forexample, Willow’s witchcraft spins out of control and becomes an addic-tion; Buffy kills Ted, who she suspects is a monster but who might behuman), but it is Spike who disrupts them most fully. Spike’s ambiguityand his movement between the poles of good and evil, human andmonstrous, upset the dichotomies on which modern Manichaean thinkingrests.Spike’s character also unsettles the metanarratives regarding thewholeness of the ‘self ’. Spike’s character poses interesting questions aboutthe ‘self ’ in our time in ways which resonate with the experience ofmarginality, but which also raise questions about the fractured self. Just asSpike expresses the outcast more fully than any other character in theshow’s ensemble, so too does he embody most fully the predicaments of afractured subjectivity: the idea that we have not one, but multipleidentities, which contend for dominance and that our subjectivities areneither fixed nor stable over the course of our lives. The way in which thisapplies to Spike is made clear in many of the articles in this issue, butreceives perhaps its fullest expression in Abbott’s detailed study of hischaracter in Season 7.Even more challengingly, Spike’s character explores the ambiguity ofgender and the pleasures of the queer self, and most fully blurs thepersistent binary narrative governing representations of gender andsexuality. Both Buffy and Angel are populated with figures who seek toquestion traditional modes of classification, who undergo unexpectedtransformations and who embody the polymorphous perverse (as takenfrom Freud, but with an attempt to strip the notion of any pathologicalconnotations). Indeed, the key to the appeal of the ‘Buffyverse’ is the wayin which it invites the notion that binary ways of thinking are redundant.The possibilities offered by challenging binary constructions of gender arearticulated most completely through the body of Spike. Indeed, it seems asthough Spike’s character performs that which other characters in theseries (and other sympathetic vampires in history) only promise. Whereother character pairings in Buffy the Vampire Slayer only promise thepleasures of homosexual and/or queer desire that are never realised,Spike acts out erotic desire in a manner that undermines heterosexual/homosexual and masculine/feminine binaries. As this issue will demon-strate, Spike thereby exemplifies Braidotti’s ‘nomadic subject’, ‘a myth,that is to say a political fiction, that allows [me] to move across establishedcategories and levels of experience: blurring boundaries without burningbridges’ (1994: 4).In the sense that Spike acts out erotic desire, he has a great deal incommon with the 19th-century lesbian vampire (despite his maleidentity). Nina Auerbach (1995) suggests that unlike her male counter-parts, the lesbian vampire Carmilla (Le Fanu, 1991[1872]) performs the 281                               8 ( 3 )promises of the sympathetic vampire, ‘she arouses, she pervades, she offersa sharing of the self. This female vampire is licensed to realize the erotic,interpenetrative friendship male vampires aroused and denied’ (1995: 39).While the erotic relationship between the vampire Angel and Buffyresults in the reanimation of Angel’s bad self, Angelus, which amounts toa refusal of interpenetrative intimacy and a reassertion of gender bound-aries, Buffy’s pairing with Spike is far more fluid and complex. Like thelesbian vampire of more than a century earlier, Spike is capable of anintimacy and a sharing of the self that other males in the series (even othersympathetic vampires) cannot accomplish. Thus Spike absolutely blursthe line between male and female desire, and between homosexual andheterosexual desire.Spike, intertextuality and kinshipAs befits its status as a canonical popular text of postmodernity, Buffy quitedeliberately courts an intertextuality that addresses the knowing fan-reader. Seeking to supersede the vampire chronicles of Anne Rice as thedefining vampire text of the late 20th century, Buffy’s vampires mock theportrayal offered by Rice. But at the same time the show acknowledges herinfluence – for by making Angel Spike’s ‘sire’ it knowingly reproduces therelationship between Lestat and Louis. At this point Spike is cast in therole of Louis, but as befits the complexity of the ‘Buffyverse’ this identi-fication is rapidly called into question. As Williamson argues in the firstarticle in this issue, Spike may be the more junior of the two vampires, butat the point in time at which we encounter these two it is he, not Angel,who takes the role of the modernized, sceptical vampire who does notabide by the traditionally sanctioned vampire law embodied by Lestat (seeGelder, 1994). This is summed up in Spike’s penultimate line in ‘SchoolHard’ – ‘From now on, we’re gonna have a little less ritual and a littlemore fun around here’. Much later in the show’s history (in a flashback in‘Lies My Parents Told Me’) there is a further nod to Spike-as-Lestat whenwe find that, on becoming a vampire, one of Spike’s first acts is to ‘sire’ hismother.6 As befits the non-normative kinship of vampire families, the songives the gift of unlife to the woman who gave him life.Yet the show subsequently denies the erotic reading of the Angel/Spikerelationship implied by the initial Lestat/Louis intertextual reference.Siring has always been a metaphor for sexual intercourse, as Rice’sdescription of Louis’ siring at the hands of Lestat makes clear. Geldercomments that Lestat ‘takes’ Louis like a lover in a ‘drawn-out ecstaticmoment which has them mingling their fluids together’ (Gelder, 1994:112). It is perhaps for this reason that, when we get to see Spike’s siring inflashback in the Season 5 episode ‘Fool for Love’, the show rewrites its ownhistory to make Drusilla Spike’s progenitor (although, as so often, this282 show has it both ways with a scene shortly afterwards showing Angel(us)   -                   :       ’            straddling Spike and holding a stake to his chest in a classic gesture ofphallic mastery). Moreover, the homoerotic reading of the relationshipbetween Angel and Spike resurfaces with a vengeance in the volume of fanwriting that surrounds the show and provides a parallel to the canonicaltext.‘Fool for Love’ is a notable episode in that it makes explicit the queernature of the vampire family within the ‘Buffyverse’. Of course, queervampire families are nothing new. Gelder explores the nature of thefamily ties between Lestat, Louis and Claudia (and beyond to the originalvampire ‘parents’ Enkil and Akasha) in Rice’s Vampire Chronicles (Gelder,1994) and questions of family feature in the cult vampire films of the1980s such as Near Dark (Kathryn Bigelow, 1987) and The Lost Boys (JoelSchumacher, 1987). However, the family dynamics in the ‘Buffyverse’take questions of kinship to a new level in the very complex relationshipbetween Angel, Spike and Drusilla and a fourth vampire, Darla (thewoman who sires Angelus in the 18th century). But the real point aboutkinship in the ‘Buffyverse’ is that queer kinship extends beyond vampirefamilies and into the world of the human characters. Judith Butler hasargued that:If we understand kinship as a set of practices that institutes relationships ofvarious kinds which negotiate the reproduction of life and the demands ofdeath, then kinship practices will be those that emerge to address fundamentalforms of human dependency, which may include birth, child-rearing, relationsof emotional dependency and support, generational ties, illness, dying, anddeath (to name a few). (Butler, 2004: 102–3)If we accept Butler’s definition of kinship practices then one of the mostmeaningful aspects of Whedon’s work (and this applies to Buffy, Angeland Firefly) is the opportunity that it offers to explore the complexities ofaffiliation which govern non-normative communities of support – thusfurther complicating the dynamics of gender and sexuality underpinningthe show(s). This definition of kinship also chimes within fandom, as fansoften understand their practices to be part of forming alternative commu-nities (see Bacon-Smith, 1992; Jenkins, 1992), and creating ‘cyber families’(Williamson, 2005: 212).About this special issueWilliamson opens this special issue by exploring what Spike has incommon with a much longer tradition of sympathetic vampires and,drawing on empirical research, she examines the appeal of this figure tofans of the vampire. Offering an historical overview of the evolution of thesympathetic vampire, she explores how this figure entered the 20thcentury as one of empathy whose ‘Otherness’ does not provoke fear, but 283                               8 ( 3 )rather is often that which we recognize in ourselves. Williamson suggeststhat Spike is both constructed and read through these historical and inter-textual modes, but that he updates the appeal of Otherness in significantways. For example, unlike previous incarnations of the vampire, the cultTV text from which Spike emerges deliberately encourages audiences toacknowledge and play with its many intertextual references to previousvampires; it encourages a fannish immersion in the text by constructingthe text as subtext, with deliberate textual winks and nods, and extendedplotlines which dwell on their own convoluted construction. The inter-textual and sub-textual nature of the show is revealed most throughSpike’s construction and is clearly identifiable in the relationship betweenSpike and Buffy, which draws on the ‘subtextual’ conventions of the ‘slashfiction’ written by fans. In this sense the text offers the polymorphoussexuality (through Spike) that is usually the realm of erotic fan fiction.In the second piece in this volume, Amy-Chinn argues that this poly-morphous sexuality is one of the many ways in which Spike transgressesboundaries. She contends that Spike does not simply subvert gender normsor sexual norms, but that Spike is ‘queer’. Amy-Chinn deconstructs theartificial boundary between gender and sexuality through which trans-gression has previously been theorized in order to demonstrate thatSpike’s ‘queerness’ operates through his erotic mobility. Spike’s sexualityand gender are simultaneously intertwined and fluid – he performsexcessive masculinity and active femininity. Yet while his biologicalmaleness is never in doubt, what it signifies is endlessly shifting. Amy-Chinn examines not only the ways in which Spike switches between maleand female, but also his ability to accommodate ‘vanilla’ sex and eroticvariation.For example, Spike’s relationship with Buffy is often based on Spiketaking the traditional ‘woman’s part’ (a desire for intimacy) and Buffytaking the ‘man’s part’ (sex followed by flight) and it is one based onpolymorphous sexual desire on both their parts. Spike refuses to definetheir encounters as abject or degrading, despite the fact that he is rejectedand abused by Buffy. But, Amy-Chinn argues, it is the power imbalance intheir relationship (with Buffy firmly in the driving seat), rather than theirunconventional and socially unacceptable sex life, that makes theirrelationship a failure. She also insists that the show has an ambivalentattitude to the ‘queerness’ it depicts by locating it in Spike, who for mostof the seven seasons is a figure of revulsion. However, Amy-Chinn suggeststhat for all of its hesitations, the depiction of Spike is one that contributesto the breakdown of gender oppositions, and to the visibility of uncon-ventional erotic practices, thus unsettling the prevailing heteronormativematrix and contributing to the ‘thinkability’ of traditionally taboopractices.In the third article, Abbott elaborates upon the way in which Spike284 updates the conventions associated with the reluctant vampire by focusing   -                   :       ’            on the depiction of moral ambiguity. Abbott argues that, while previousvampires walk a fine line between good and evil, Spike inhabits a far morefractured self that overreaches this binary opposition. Through an analysisof the narrative structure and mise-en-scène of the final series of Buffy theVampire Slayer, Abbott demonstrates that Spike undergoes the mostdramatic character development of any of the characters in the show, andthat this is effected through the presentation of multiple Spikes, a self thatis looking for unity, but that has been exponentially fragmented. NotingSpike’s move from being ‘bad’, to being ‘chipped’ (an implant which pre-vents him from harming humans), to being ‘mad’, to being ensouled,Abbott examines in detail the manner in which Spike’s multiplicity isovertly addressed within the narrative and dialogue of the show. Sherelates this to the deconstruction of Spike’s leather-clad bad-boy bikerimage in Season 7, each of Spike’s multiple selves being depicted througha different visual look. Abbott examines how these multiple selves operateto push the narrative forward in the final season, arguing that it is onlySpike’s recognition and acceptance of his own fractured nature whichenables him to acquire the strength he needs to sacrifice himself in theseason finale. Only this way can Spike contribute to the show’s ultimatelesson, which abjures the privileging of uniqueness (of himself or even theSlayer) in favour of celebrating the power of collective action.Hills and Williams’ piece shifts the discussion from one whichconcentrates on the textual construction of, and the fannish engagementswith, the character Spike, to one which examines the relationshipbetween the character and the meanings attached to him by the actor whoplays him, James Marsters. Hills and Williams argue that Marsters’impact on our understanding of his character is ‘situated’. By this theymean that Marsters does have agency in terms of interpreting Spike (bothon-screen and off), but that this is tempered by his role in the hierarchy ofproduction (wracked as it is with internal struggles) in which he does nothave an entirely ‘free hand’ in the performance of his star persona. Hillsand Williams consider Marsters to be a ‘subcultural celebrity’, by whichthey mean a celebrity specific to the audience and fandom surroundingBuffy the Vampire Slayer, rather than by general star recognition. There isan overlapping between Marsters and Spike in a number of secondarytexts that circulate around the show, which Hills and Williams considernot only to merge actor and character, but which also make Marstersappear ‘fan-like’; they suggest that this disrupts the distance between ‘fan’and ‘celebrity’. Key to this intervention is Marsters’ self-styled acces-sibility to his fans. His positive encounters with fans having beenperfected, he manages to perform simultaneously the role of accessiblenice guy and enigmatic persona. In addition, rather than seeing celebrityas only a product of institutional forces, Hills and Williams suggest thatMarsters’ celebrity indicates a need to examine more closely the way inwhich actors participate in industry forms of promotion.285286                               8 ( 3 )This special issue then moves on to a shorter piece by Sue Turnbullwhich develops Hills and Williams’ contribution by offering a personalmeditation on the way in which Marsters performs Spike, and the effectthat this has on the author. Turnbull explores the way in which perfor-mance can become part of our own lived experience – inspiring andtransforming the viewer – and suggesting that watching television canindeed have an impact on the way in which we experience the world.This special issue closes with a commentary by Vivien Burr on the 2004Slayage Conference on Buffy the Vampire Slayer held in Nashville in May2004, and combines ethnographic analysis with reflection on thefan–scholar divide that has been the subject of much academic attention(for example, Burt, 1998; Doty, 2000; Frith, 1990; Hills, 2002; Jenkins,1992; Michael, 2000). In his own reflections on the conference, one of theorganizers, David Lavery (2004), talks about almost 400 Buffy scholar-fansand fan-scholars ‘having the time of their lives talking about, dissecting,and singing about a show they love beyond the possibility to describe’.Lavery is responding to criticism by Levine and Schneider (2003) in‘Feeling for Buffy: The Girl Next Door’ that Buffy scholars are so in lovewith the show that their scholarship is often unreflective, narrow andmistaken.Yet Burr calls into questions Lavery’s emotive response to Levine andSchnieder’s criticism noting that she, and several other conference atten-dees who responded to her enquiries, felt stirrings of unease when it wasmentioned that thought had been given to inviting a member of Buffy’scast to the conference. Moreover, she notes that sessions did, on occasion,veer away from academic analysis into heated discussion on topics that didnot seem to fit into a scholarly environment. She notes, in particular thatemotions ran high on the subject of Spike – and that any scholarpresenting a paper that sought to criticize the character was met withconsiderable hostility. This, of course, is to show precisely that lack ofcritical distance for which Levine and Schneider so roundly condemnBuffy studies.Burr does not attempt to address the reasons why Spike is such a site ofcontention among fan-scholars and scholar-fans and we were intrigued,although not surprised, that this was the case. Rather, it confirmed to usthat there was indeed something about Spike that resonated with fans andscholars of the show in a way not found in the other supporting characters,and that this warranted an in-depth analysis.As far as we are aware, despite the huge volume of Buffy and Angelscholarship available in print and on the internet, this is the first time asingle, supporting character of the shows has been the focus of anacademic endeavour. We hope that the articles in this issue convince thereader that Spike is worth both the accolade and the effort.   -                   :       ’            AcknowledgementsThe special issue editors would like to thank all those connected with theEuropean Journal of Cultural Studies for offering us the opportunity to turn ouridea for a journal issue on Spike into reality. In particular we would like to expressour gratitude to Joke Hermes for her advice, guidance and enthusiasm for thisendeavour. Thanks must also go to all our contributors, and to our colleagues andfamilies whose support has been invaluable. Copyright restrictions mean that weare unable to include images of Spike in this edition; readers unfamiliar with thecharacter who would like a sense of his physical appearance are advised to visithttp://www.jamesmarsters.com (the official website of the actor who playsSpike). The gallery and downloads at this site offer a number of good images.Notes1. http:/www.reallyscary.com/news101501.asp (accessed 11 January 2005).2. Buffy the Vampire Slayer has become renowned among both fans andscholars for its creative use of language and the creation of ‘Buffyspeak’. ABuffy lexicon has been published by Oxford University Press (Adams,2004), and Adams will be editing the first special issue of the online journalSlayage on ‘Beyond Slayer Slang: Pragmatics, Discourse and Style in Buffythe Vampire Slayer’ (forthcoming).3. For an analysis of the ideological implications of Angel’s curse see Amy-Chinn (2003).4. Throughout this special issue, episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer will bereferenced by title with the season and episode given in bracketsafterwards. Episodes of the spin-off show Angel will follow the same formatbut will be prefixed with an A. Episodes are referenced in each article, butonly the first time that they are cited.5. ‘Siring’ is the ‘Buffyverse’ term for the process by which a human becomesa vampire and involves, in keeping with vampire mythology, the exchangeof blood between two parties.6. In the DVD commentary to this episode the writers (David Fury and DrewGoddard) reveal that they gave Spike’s mother the name ‘Anne’. They saythey chose this as it is Buffy’s middle name, but we might note that it isalso Rice’s first name.References<ref>Adams, Michael (2004) Slayer Slang: A Buffy the Vampire Slayer Lexicon.</ref>Oxford: Oxford University Press.<ref>Amy-Chinn, Dee (2003) ‘Good Vampires Don’t Suck: Sex, Celibacy and the</ref>Body of Angel’, in Carla Kungl (ed.)
