In this debate, a point frequently mentioned to prove eitherconvergence or divergence of national business systems is the role played bymultinational corporations (MNCs), i.e. companies that are by definition locatedin more than just one national business system. Here the national businesssystems literature generally assumes, that MNCs from a specific home countryinterfere into the existing competitive and institutional settings of the countries inwhich they invest, mainly by transferring as far as possible their productiontechniques and labour practices. While this rather general assumption is cer-tainly not wrong, some of its more detailed arguments – especially on the unityof the behaviour of all MNCs from a certain home country as well as on theunity of locational and organisational conditions in the host country – seem tobe debatable.Following this objective, this paper, using the empirical case of Germanforeign direct investment (FDI) in Hungary, will put emphasis on heterogeneity,both of the transfer strategies of MNCs from a certain home country (Germany)as well as of the locational conditions in the host country (Hungary). After ashort review of some central assumptions of the national business systems ap-proach to corporate internationalisation and a few theoretical remarks on theinternational transfer of industrial models in MNCs, we first look, whether thereis a uniform German industrial model, all German MNCs might feel inclined totransfer when investing abroad. Since not all elements of a national industrial1 This paper presents some results from an ongoing empirical research project on "ExogenousInfluences in path dependent transformation processes: The effects of German FDI on workorganisation and labour relations in Hungary". The project is funded by the VolkswagenFoundation and hosted by the Free University, Berlin. For a description of the wider aims ofthis project, that the author is conducting together with M. Fichter (Free University, Berlin), L.Neumann (National Labour Centre, Budapest), A. Tóth (Hungarian Academy of Sciences,Budapest) and M. Wortmann (WZB and FAST, Berlin) cf. Dörrenbächer et al. (2000a). Forstimulating discussions and useful hints the author is grateful to G. Dörr, K. Bluhm, J. Gam-melgaard, K. Hirschfeld, T. Kessel, R. Lungwitz, E. Preusche, S. Quack, T. Schulten and M.Wortmann. Previous versions of the paper were presented at the workshop “European Re-structuring in a Global Economy” jointly organized by the MIT, SOFI and WZB (Berlin, 30thNovember 2001) and at the 27th annual meeting of the European International BusinessAcademy (EIBA) (Paris, 14th December 2001).1model are transferable by MNCs,2 this papers concentrates on those elementswhose transfer lie in the hands of MNCs. That is: the transfer of (1) the produc-tion model encompassing e.g. technology, machinery (and associated skills)production and work organisation and (2) the transfer of the model of labourpractices including specific human resource management (HRM) and industrialrelations (IR) practices. Next to that we will shift perspectives and look at re-gional differences that Hungary displays as a location for foreign investments.Having thus dealt with the institutional background we will take an empirical lookat the real transfer processes that occurred in German MNCs investing inHungary.2.Multinational Corporations and National BusinessSystemsDealing with MNCs from an institutionalist point of view is a rather new phe-nomenon. It was not until the beginning of the 1990s that institutionalist thinking,strongly put forward in the 1970s and 1980s, was applied to MNCs (Westney1993) and its advent can be seen as a step against the strong dominance ofbest practice approaches at that time. Best practice approaches, popularised bymanagement consultancies and some parts of business academia derive asingle best practice for the internationalisation of companies from their under-standing of relevant market forces such as transnational product harmonisation,the growing importance of fixed costs and the fact that major innovations occurin all regions of the Triad. In this view, more or less all MNCs have to apply avalue-based management style and to go for global presence while integratingeconomies of scale and national responsiveness (Bartlett/Goshal 1989, Ohmae1990). The institutionalist view strongly opposes the idea that market con-straints impose a specific best practice to the international co-ordination andconfiguration of an MNC and instead stresses that the specific social and insti-tutional environment of an MNC is the dominant (or sole) source of normativepressure that shapes the behaviour of an MNC. According to this view, MNCsare by no means free to choose a single best practice solution, but theirinternationalisation is shaped by their specific economic, political and institu-tional home environment (e.g. Ruigrok/van Tulder 1995). However, very muchlike the best practice approach, pure institutionalist explanations on corporateinternationalisation have been criticised for not being complex enough. Mueller(1994) stressed that the behaviour of MNCs generally reflects both societal2 One striking example is the export of the German vocational training system. While the com-pany can decide whether to introduce the on-the-job part of the vocational training system inforeign subsidiaries, it has no final control whether the state in which it is investing maintainsor is willing to build up a system of vocational schools (cf. Bluhm 2001, Tüselmann et al.2000).2embeddedness and global best practices, with global best practices mainlyspurred by: (1) a growing convergence of product and process technologywithin sectors, (2) an increasing use of benchmarking as a tool for cross-sectoral dissemination of best practices and (3) a strong exchange of technol-ogy and management practices within MNCs. Taking that differentiation a stepfurther, Dörrenbächer (2000) added corporate idiosyncrasies as an explanatoryfactor for the internationalisation of companies. As a reason he mentions thatthere is manifold empirical evidence that companies rooted in the same industry(or segment thereof) and the same national business system show remarkabledifferences in their internationalisation behaviour. According to this approachcorporate idiosyncrasies might be shaped by structural aspects (such as theage, the size or the degree of diversification of a company) as well as by the“specific historical development or in other words the “trajectory” (Boyer/Freyssenet 1995) of a company.Beyond the critique, that the national business system approach (alone) isnot complex enough to explain the real life variance in overall corporate interna-tionalisation, a second point to be explored in more detail in this paper, needsspecific attention: Many institutionalist approaches to MNCs (e.g. Hu 1992,Sally 1994, Ruigrok/van Tulder 1995, Pauly/Reich 1997, Whitley 1999, Morganet al. 2000) put a strong emphasis on the impact of the country of origin (or thehome country) of the MNC. This is somewhat ignoring the fact the multinationalcorporations are sui generis located in more than one national business systemwith both home and (different/multiple) host country effects being at work. WhileMorgan et al. (2000) explain this limitation by pragmatic reasons, Whitley (2001)considers host country as well as foreign subsidiary influences as rather un-interesting since, according to his opinion, these influences are in most casesnot very likely to provoke a fundamental organisational change throughout thewhole MNC: The “… discussion of how different kinds of firm from differentbusiness systems and institutional contexts are likely to conduct their FDI incontrasting business environments emphasizes the continuing importance oftheir domestic institutions and established ways of coordinating economicactivities in their home economies” (Whitley 2001: 60-61). Here, two remarkshave to be made.– First, the very strong emphasis on the country of origin influences seems tobe debatable, taking into consideration the strong strategic desire of the topmanagement of many MNCs to flee certain aspects of their country of originbusiness system and/or to learn from or to experiment with aspects of otherbusiness systems. In addition it has to be kept in mind that today the domi-nant way to internationalise is external growth by (often rather large) M&As(Wortmann 2000), and it is especially these large acquired subsidiaries andtheir managers that are assigned a strategic role, “… not only for their owncompany but for the MNC as a whole” (Hedlund 1986: 22). In this perspec-tive, that has received growing attention in recent years (e.g. Goshal/Nohria31989, Gupta/Govindarajan 1994, Birkinshaw et al. 1998, Kristensen/Zeitlin1999, Gammelgard 2000) foreign subsidiaries are no longer seen as "merelydistant tools of corporate management, reacting as ganglia to impulses sentdownward through the bureaucratic nervous system" (Taggert 1998) but asimportant strategic parts of MNCs, that due to their specific organisationalassets and local embeddedness might systematically contribute to the firmspecific advantages of MNCs.– Second, taking an overall MNC perspective like Whitley does, is systemati-cally hiding host country influences, that might have a strong influence on theforeign subsidiaries of the MNC in question. Such host country influences arereported to be especially strong with regard to all human resource manage-ment and industrial relations issues (Rosenzweig/Nohira 1994, UNCTAD1994). Next to that, taking an overall MNC perspective is only delivering onesingle picture for the MNC, despite the fact that by nature an MNC encom-passes many different views, that in many cases lead to very relevant micropolitical struggles with the MNC.All in all it seems that the national business system approach (despite strongmerits in the comparison of MNCs from different home countries) can only partlyexplain corporate internationalisation and thus needs to be accomplished byother approaches. One such approach, that is more opening the “black box” ofinternationalisation is the emerging literature on the transfer of industrial modelsin MNCs.3.The Transfer of Industrial Models in MNCsEver since the first industrial revolution, the transfer either of single technologiesor production models as a whole was of specific importance for the economicdevelopment of nations. Britain’s early start in the industrialisation around 1750triggered a first intense phase of technology transfer to continental Europe,Scandinavia and the USA in the late 18th Century (ÓBrien 1986, Bruland 1991).More than hundred years later, around the first World War, Fordism in theUnited States generated a new standard of productive efficiency transferred toEurope and (to a lesser extent) to Japan (Kipping/Bjarnar 1998, Zeitlin/Herrigel2000), superseded in the 1970s by the “global Japanisation” (Elger/Smith1994). The study of these great historic transfer cases reveals that there is botha multitude of (individual and collective) transfer agents as well as a greatvariety of transfer channels. Thus looking at the transfer in and by MNCs (as inthis paper) is only a partial view, though not an unimportant one. With regard tothe transfer of industrial models via MNCs at least the following three analyticallevels seem to be relevant: content, results and processes.43.1. ContentUp until now the question on what is transferred by multinationals while invest-ing abroad is mostly treated implicitly. One of the more explicit treatments of thisquestion is done by Sölvell/Zander (1998) who distinguish between the transferof physical, human and social capital, with the transfer of physical capital suchas standard materials, components, products and machinery being the mostmobile, human capital, embodied e.g. in the tacit knowledge of the workers,being less mobile and social capital, embedded e.g. in social relations in (local)business networks, being the least mobile. However, in real transfer processes,the transfer of one type of capital is usually strongly connected to the transfer ofa second or even a third type of capital. A particularly strong connection seemsto exist between the transfer of physical and human capital. There is strong evi-dence that even the transfer of the rather mobile machinery (or technology) isburdened with many problems (Gertler 1995). These problems arise from thefact that machinery (or technology) always consist of a kind of hardware (orsoftware) and knowledge, with the knowledge in most cases being localised andtacit, taking the form of un-codified skills or capabilities (Bruland 1991). Goingbeyond the transfer of a single machine or technology and looking at the trans-fer of whole industrial models, similar, but much more complex problems arise.This is easily understandable looking at what is an industrial model. Accordingto the definition underlying this paper an industrial model consists of (1) a pro-duction model encompassing e.g. technology, machinery (and associates skills)production and work organisation and (2) a model of labour practices includingspecific human resource management (HRM) and industrial relations (IR) prac-tices.Up to now only a few studies, such as the work of the Gerpisa Group on thetransfer and hybridisation of production models in the automobile industry lookat transfer issues in such a broad and interconnected way (Boyer/Freyssenet2000, Boyer et al. 1998, Dörr/Kessel 1999). However, there is a wealth of lit-erature that focuses on the transfer of HRM and IR practices (such as tradeunion recognition, collective pay bargaining, shop floor employee representa-tion, employee information, consultation and participation) throughout MNCs(for a recent overview cf. Tüselmann et al. 2000).3.2. ResultsAlmost all empirical studies that look at the cross-border transfer of industrialmodels come to the conclusion that a certain amount of change is always nec-essary to successfully run a factory or a business developed in one nationalbusiness system abroad. However, this does not mean that a one-to-onetransfer is excluded in reality, especially not with regard to the transfer of single5technologies or single HRM/IR aspects. Thus catching all levels of analysis, atypology that measures changes associated with cross-border transfer proc-esses in our opinion has to comprise (1) one-to-one transfers, (2) simple adap-tation, where only minor changes occur, (3) real hybridisation, where the trans-fer process result in something that strongly deviates both from what wasintended to transfer and from corresponding indigenous solutions, and (4) theassertion of indigenous solutions (cf. too Boyer et al. 1998).3.3ProcessesUp until now a clear process focus is somewhat underrepresented in the litera-ture on the transfer of industrial models. Next to the general literature on expa-triates, there are only a few studies that have looked in greater detail at thequality and the sequencing of transfer processes, including the way or the proc-ess how local adaptations or even hybridisations occur. Interestingly, almost allof these studies concentrate on transfer processes undertaken by westernMNCs to their subsidiaries in Eastern Europe. For instance Rudolph (2000),looking at transfer processes to Polish subsidiaries emanating from their west-ern parent companies, stresses that transfer always involves stays abroad,either of the personnel from the model sending unit or from the model receivingunit. Moreover, she emphasises that personal relationships are a major vehiclein the transfer process, with the expatriate mangers playing different roles suchas “... bicultural interpreter, national defender and advocate or frontline imple-menter of corporate strategy” (Paauwe/Dewe 1994:97). A detailed look into thequality of personal relationships during transfer processes is given by Kessel/Dörr (1998). One of the companies they looked at used a kind of a tandem-management with expatriates and local managers sharing for a certain time theboth the job and the responsibility. These tandems were designed as instru-ments to effectively transfer knowledge from the expatriate to the local man-ager. However, it turned out, that these tandems became important micro-politi-cal arenas for the solution of conflicts on social, cultural as well as practicalissues. This study also sheds light on the fact that transfer strategies mightchange dramatically over the time. Due to many conflicts in those managementtandems, it was also detected that the original intention to more or less fullytransfer the country of origin industrial model would go too far and negativelyaffect crucial questions of identity and status of the local personnel. Thisresulted in a significant rewriting of the transfer strategy, with the modernisedsubsidiary finally turning out as a real hybrid, which was not intended before,but turned out to be a successful solution.After this short discussion of transfer issues, we will now turn to our empiri-cal case. We will first take a short look at the German Model, its main pillars andits inherent logic. Based on our assumption that the German Model was never6as consistent as it is often presented, as well as on the thesis of an increasingheterogeneity within the German Model since the beginning of the 1990s(Flecker/Schulten 1999, Muller 1999), we will show that there are different com-pany specific interpretations of the German Model so far, that might be thebasis of what German companies wish to export when internationalising.4.The German Model and its Industry/Company-SpecificInterpretationThere is little disagreement on what the main pillars of the German Model are.According to a recent definition that draws on a wealth of former works (e.g.Katzenstein 1980, Markovitz 1982, Streeck 1995, just to mention a few), theGerman Model consists of the following main items (Flecker/Schulten 1999: 83,points are added):– “social market economy” (Soziale Marktwirtschaft), that is, capitalism tamedby political macro-regulation and redistribution by the state;– long term perspectives and a preference for productive investments on thepart of the capital;– highly organised industrial relations combining sectoral multi-employer bar-gaining and co-operative labour relations within the enterprise;– a vocational training system that combines on-the-job-training with the edu-cation in vocational schools and– diversified quality production based on highly skilled workforces“Somewhat overlapping with these items the more recent discussion hasemphasised the specific aspect of corporate governance (e.g. Albert 1993,Caspar/Vitols 1997, Lallement 2001). Here the German Model is usually asso-ciated with the following three items:– the strong role of the banks in providing long-term credit leading to patientcapital;– the system of co-determination and;– a style of management that is more driven by technological then by financialaims (Jürgens et al. 2000: 59).According to many observers the interplay of these institutions and attitudes ledto a considerable economic and social progress in post war Germany. Industrialconflict was widely pacified by the redistribution policy of the state (especially infunding adjustment measures) as well as by the specific construction of the7labour relations and vocational training systems. Thus the German laboursystem keeps the typically severe conflicts about wages more or less out of thecompanies and at the same time allows works councils to exert some influenceon the conditions of the use of labour (via a set of information, consultation andco-determination rights). Also the vocational training system which is partlyfinanced by the state and which produces large numbers of skilled workers,reflects a compromise between capital and work since it creates both companyspecific skills (via the on the job training) as well as more general transferableskills (via the training in vocational schools). Another important effect inherent tothe German model is its favouring of “high road” strategies. Next to the “patientcapital”, it is mainly the fact that short term cutting of labour costs is both ratherdifficult and costly, that directs companies much more to strategies that aim atan increase of productivity and quality, than to strategies that aim at price com-petition.On the shop floor, however, the general conditions of the German Modelsuch as the availability of skilled labour, a strong institutional backing of highroad strategies as well as rather pacified labour relations, did not in all caseslead to a production concept other than the Fordist one, which is characterisedby centrally planned taylorized work. On the contrary, following the literaturereview by Flecker/Schulten (1999: 86) as well as a review of some more recentstudies, there has always been and today still is a strong polarisation between(1) certain industries such as the machine tool industry or the printing industrywhere new concepts of work with a higher autonomy of the workers and a highlevel of job sophistication exist and (2) other industries such as the automobileand the clothing industry where low skill, Taylorist-Fordist production organisa-tion prevails, with the effect of a strong under-utilisation of the existing skill base(Pries et al. 1989 cited in Flecker/Schulten 1999, Kurz 1999, Springer 2000,Nordhause-Janz/Prekuhl 2000). Enduring differences are also reported withregard to shop floor employee representation. Here especially small (fewer than100 employees) and all larger firms differ a lot according to the existence orrespectively the effectiveness of shop floor employee representation. There areboth differences in the resources works councils can draw on (e.g. degree ofthe exemption from the work for works council members, availability of outsideexpertise, paid qualification), as well as differences in the level they are ableand “allowed” to fulfil their tasks as assigned by law (Dorsch-Schweizer/Schulten 2001).3An increase in the heterogeneisation of the German Model as a wholeoccurred with the post-unification crisis in Germany and the flaring up of thediscussion about the competitiveness of Germany as a production location from3 Coping with these differences was one of the major aims of the spring 2001 reform of the„Betriebsverfassungsgesetz“.81992/3 on. Next to the growing importance of the stock markets in companyfinancing and a more commercial orientation of the management, the maindriving force here is the increased decentralisation of collective bargaining(Flecker/Schulten 1999, Schroeder/Weinert 1999, Upchurch 2000). Decentrali-sation of collective bargaining mainly occurs through the introduction of a vari-ety of opening clauses to sectoral collective agreements, allowing for companyspecific differentiation. While in the case of wage issues this development doesnot necessarily lead to a greater heterogeneisation between the companies,4this is obviously the case with regard to working time issues (cutting, enlargingand flexibility of working time). All in all, a recent study undertaken by a Germantrade union related institute (WSI), comes to the conclusion that the flexibilityinherent in this decentralisation has already resulted in strong differences in theworking and wage conditions in the same industry (Bispinck 2001).Taking together the enduring differences according to the type of produc-tion and the shop floor employee representation, as well as the more recenttendency towards a decentralisation of collective bargaining, there is a consid-erable scope of different industry or respectively company specific interpreta-tions of the German Model (cf. figure 1).Figure 1: The scope of industry/company specific interpretation of the GermanModelStrong adherence tosectoral collectivebargainingEffective shop floor employeerepresentationHigh skill Post-fordist typeof productionVery decentralisedcollective bargainingNo or rather ineffective shopfloor employee representationLow skill, Fordist type ofproduction4 This is due to the fact that it was quite usual in successful companies to pay more than thecollective agreement proposes. In recent times, however, the negotiations on the companylevel are not about additional payments but about their freezing or reduction. Whether thisleads to a greater amount of harmonisation is difficult to say, since there is also evidencethat decentralised company level bargaining in troubled firms leads to regulations below thestandards of sectoral collective agreements (cf. Bispinck 2001).95.Hungary as a Heterogeneous Location for Foreign DirectInvestmentsHeterogeneity is not only restricted to the firm specific interpretation of the rele-vant country of origin business system but refers also to regional differences inhost countries. As many other Central and East European countries, Hungaryshows strong regional inequalities with regard to different aspects that are cru-cial for foreign investments. These include:– labour market conditions (e.g. availability of a skilled workforce)– infrastructure conditions (e.g. availability of transportation and communicationmeans and other economic structures such as related industries, businessservices, sufficient housing conditions, cultural offers etc.) and– industrial relations conditions (presence of trade unions, works councils, col-lective bargaining structures).It is widely maintained that Hungary is historically displaying a double dividewith regard to many aspects just mentioned. One split is between Budapest andthe larger provincial cities on the one hand and the small and medium sizedcities as well as the countryside on the other hand. This split, inherited from pre-socialist times prevailed despite the egalitarian attitude of socialist regional pol-icy and was aggravated due to the general decline of the agricultural sector inthe post socialist transition process (Cséfalvay et al. 1997). The second split isbetween East Hungary and Central/West Hungary. Here especially the Buda-pest region and the regions neighbouring the Austrian borders do possess amuch better infrastructure than the East. Taking a low unemployment rate as anindicator for a work force, flexible enough to adjust to the transformation needsduring the 1990ies, again the Central region around Budapest as well as West-ern Hungary are much more favourable to foreign investments than the Easternpart of the country. Finally the heterogeneity of Hungary as an investment loca-tion also relates to industrial relations conditions. Despite a generally low levelof regulation, the more modernized Central and Western parts of Hungary todaydisplay a somewhat higher level of regulation, resulting from a stronger pres-ence of trade unions and a more widespread existence of works councils (Toth1999, Kisgyörgy/Vámos 2001). Probably more important with regard to theregional heterogeneity of Hungary as an investment location are the resultsfrom the extremely individualized and decentralised Hungarian wage determi-nation system (Neumann 2000). Here the local labour market performance isplaying a decisive role, with the labour markets in Central and West Hungary10being rather tight (and wages rather high) as a result of a strong concentrationof foreign direct investments in those regions.56.The Transfer of the German Industrial Model to Hungaryvia FDI: Empirical ResultsIn line with the general trend, also German FDI have concentrated in the moredeveloped Central and Western region of Hungary. Taken as a whole Hungarytoday is the seventh most attractive host country for German investments andGermany is the single largest foreign investor in Hungary. German investmentsin Hungary concentrate on a few industries such as electronics, automotive,food beverage & tobacco, machinery and metal products. These five industriesaccount for approx. 60 percent of all German investments in Hungary (in termsof foreign employment). Compared to the overall structure of German FDI,Hungary is of specific importance for labour intensive industries such as appareland footwear production.Out of a total sample of about 150 German investments in Hungary wehave selected 10 cases (cf. Table 1), for a closer examination of transferissues.6 These 10 cases represent to a large extend the main structural charac-teristics of the total sample (Dörrenbächer et al. 2000b).75 In 1999 unemployment was below 6 percent in Central (Country of Pest) and parts of West-ern Hungary (Countries of Zala, Vas, Györ-Moson-Sopron) compared to 12 or more percentin all eastern and most southern parts of the countries (OECD 2000: 113)6 These cases are based on interviews in the German headquarters and/or their Hungariansubsidiary, that the author has conducted during October 2000 and March 2001. Most inter-views were conducted together with Michael Wortmann. To make the cases anonymous wasnot required by our interview partners. The existing provisional case studies will be inte-grated into final case studies by different members of the project team (cf. footnote 1).7 Almost identical with the overall picture about 70% of the investors in the sample are smalland medium-sized companies; for about half of them the Hungarian subsidiary is the onlyforeign production location. Again very close to the overall trend, three quarters of the casesare acquisitions. Furthermore the sample comprises investments in all those industries,where the amount of German investment is above their world-wide average (with the notableexception of the food/beverage/tobacco industry). Only concerning the location of the in-vestments the sample shows a slight weakness since investments in the developed Centraland Western region of Hungary are slightly underrepresented. Finally, next to large andsmall Hungarian subsidiaries, the sample comprises strong export-oriented subsidiaries,subsidiaries that mainly produce for the local market, as well as subsidiaries with a splitmarket orientation.11ropxt tropx) 0% (30 l7 a( ca a to Lo trol l rc c p d po o x n xEE E L L E a Ese )c 1-ro ,t sc rive o ele sn )1 dnd se (3 noia l s ta raic ic e rn n cu paro atc ch sd recle e an irE m tr A (29 leEp ))81(le )7) )6 6 r(2 (2 apt t pn n ae e kem em roC C W P**tke itonra tan tM ie rr oopxro *) )(A (Gn ld Aio ie >t f -is n Gi eu eq rc GA)ecaN(stcudorPtnemEge3(srotomlacirtpolevecrelevetsedup la ep noimooitilia l&w lacfa re mu sn tio n=t e Ec v Md w Srpo rne .revw o one e rn ru tuild vin n oe tu tab in lety jo reb s n. ih ve.g t ie r gea w ure ho ifgc ,*e d *r e .e d dw n os u oo rhre fu s uc a obtu w hrs re igtu enie tlkd ven tehilefw inen n ynee a ar r pg o mew re ocu rn t, n ot e tn v nlpa itn lpaa jo gf a itnro tss ixA G G G-> -> A A -> -> G A A A A g tG AA As te ) tla a 2 oP m (2 oF oF Sw))%%) 0% (30 l7 a( ctro Lop dx nE agnitnig rn Pig ,)a 5k 2c (a sp laitc irtr tr lo o ap p cx x oE E L)23(tnemp) ) i(19 (19 equr r gea ea inhw tw cto i50 ..a 00 008 n 4 .21g g din in epp po lolo le e ev v ve e egnipolevetd sa efü yh par n da o u)m 0y 0 0lpo (20 39Reninito rya ac gtn Halo nl u medeplevrpséelasehtfoscitsiretcaracnihPa )M r gn itsetso ire go in: Iven fre tr1n th ca ea /o fu ff /yelT G (s anm lluaB (ESMb rm zea e iu )sthe ith muw id) on d e% s fe me s) 5% (45 l5 a( ctro Lop dx nE a u) d v s, 8 te e rers 2te +a 7he (2, ss er ce ak lo peo rC if/n yneja re irv f ee -o tah naek tta s ma te n roó n teh ea fytr ylg toa á ig m gon A loow -> nll hG cfo et . tath itasn ca le tm ann r .o /ao e ts ao lne wd in rpa re tn nn elG p so ed-> ld rcruA o p s oe iz.sisabdO:eS1(revolluipoleveylehrásávözepoleveam dd aó z0 0 0 0 0 0 03 0 5 5 8 8 73 7 5 3 3 2 2d d d g ge epe in inp p pg dn elo lo loe e ev v ve e eakid cn re abm nc re iza e atnemeZrDD D D D D D DD D D DVH SS BB B V B KE-4M B BE-4s e )) rs to ) rg sy o o e yee/ m /n l)ob /E e e r /ng l))o ia senz /E end /yEto Ed rs M P M ie aeb M aeF (S FH (S H (L üK (S M (S N (SM ro Me E rTlam rgeNred )s Ie /san /yC )se -reV )noSn /y le e s /m rgm Ee a a MaS (aL iS (L W(S *6.1.Transfer Intentions, Forms and ResultsOne of the most striking common features among the 10 cases is the fact thatalmost all German MNCs intended a one-to-one transfer of all those aspects oftheir industrial model that are related to technology, machinery, production andwork organisation (i.e. the production model). Usually the transfer of thoseaspects was highly interconnected. Only in one rather exceptional case, wherethe production technology as such was very outdated, the transfer only aimed atthe integration of a few machines and tools into an already existing productionsite in Hungary (Wamsler-SVT).8The transfer itself took several forms. In four of the cases studied, an exist-ing plant or production line was built down in Germany, shipped to Hungary andbuilt up there (Balluff, FHP, März, Kübler). Of the same type, but somewhat dif-ferent was the Siemens case. Here a production line for switching equipmentwas build down at the Austrian switching plant of Siemens in Vienna and thewhole transfer to Hungary was managed by the Austrian subsidiary. In threeother cases (Salamander, Heidelberger Zement, Festo) the transfer occurred asa strong modernisation and reorganisation of an existing production. Finally,there was one case, where the investor, based on knowledge gained in Ger-many over many decades, built up a totally new, state-of-the-art factory in Hun-gary (Nordenia).Unlike the well reported flagship case of German investments in Hungary,the Audi-Györ case, where innovations for the whole Audi Group were clearlyintended (Kessel/Dörr 1998:2), our case studies revealed only weak intentionsto innovate with the investments in Hungary. There is only one case where theinvestment was somewhat influenced by the possibility to get access to a newproduct not produced before in the MNC (Festo) and another case where theHungarian subsidiary over the years gained some, however rather minor R&Dtasks for the whole MNC (Balluff). Process innovations were not at all intendedin our cases. Companies that used to apply a Fordist production (based on tay-lorised work) in their (former) German production (such as Salamander or FHP)did so in Hungary, too, and companies that followed more modern productionstrategies in Germany such as flexible specialisation (incl. group work), did so inHungary, too (e.g. Nordenia, Balluff, Festo). Interestingly, especially the lattercompanies can hardly be seen as purely transferring a German solution giventhe many explicitly Japanese aspects such as Kanban or Kaizen, they haveincorporated (usually with the help of Japanese consultants) in their firm-specific model.8 Wamsler-SVT is a rather exceptional case, since the Hungarian subsidiary (SVT) has takenover its former minority shareholder (Wamsler) in November 2000.13These rather conservative ideas and aims associated with the transfer ofthe production model (i.e. technology, machinery, production and work organi-sation) certainly reflect the large socio-economic gap between Germany andHungary as well as the conviction of some of our interview partners to run astate-of-the-art, world class, factory. However, with regard to a few companies,this tendency also reflects a strategy of “security first”, with transferring the firm-specific production model one-to-one being “... the best way to control any kindof catastrophe” (owner/manager of a German MNC). According to this interviewpartner these “catastrophes” not only relate to transfer problems as such, butalso include labour disputes in Germany.This refers to the question of transferring the German Model of labour prac-tices (HRM and IR practices). Despite the fact that many of our interview part-ners (from the management side) initially maintained that they had transferredthe German Model of HRM and IR practices, a closer examination showed arather different result. Thus, it turned out that in many cases the sheer existenceof a works council at the Hungarian affiliate and the strong desire of the man-agement to transfer the German wage classification scheme were treated assufficient indicators for the German Model having been transferred. Indeed,almost all companies in our sample aimed at such a transfer of the Germanwage classification scheme to harmonise wage discrepancies within (and insome cases between) individual wage groups in their Hungarian affiliates9. Andin nine out of the ten cases a works council exists at the Hungarian subsidiary.However, only in two cases these works councils were considered strongenough to really be a bargaining partner for the management. In all other casesthe works council was either installed with the help of the management, more orless ignored, or only used to channel information into the workforce. In abouthalf of our cases unions were completely absent at the Hungarian subsidiariesand sectoral collective bargaining did not occur at all. Collective bargaining atthe company level was reported for half of the companies. However, in mostcases these were rather informal talks on wages and not real bargaining proc-esses. At the other half of the companies, wages and working conditions wereonly subject of individual negotiations between each employee and the man-agement.Especially the last two points mentioned imply a strong depart from theGerman Model of industrial relations. This depart is even stronger if we look atsome HRM practices: Trial and error employee selection, the use of leasedworkers, frequent overtime or work on weekends are in almost all cases simplymanagement prerogatives, that are excessively used by some companies. All inall there is a general tendency to not or only very selectively transfer the Ger-9 These are due to historical legacies and the different regional as well as historical labourmarket conditions in Hungary.14man Model of HRM and IR practices. This holds true despite the fact that thereare considerable differences among the cases. Confirming the results of Bluhm(2001), large MNCs such as Siemens or Heidelberger Zement are following theGerman path of labour relations in Hungary much more strictly than many smallGerman investors.10 This is also half true for those German companies, thatapply a high skill Post-Fordist production systems: While these companies relaymuch more on skilled workers and invest a lot in training, this does not auto-matically mean, that they also transfer their German IR practices to their Hun-garian subsidiary.Taken together German investors in Hungary seem to follow mixed inten-tions with regard to their transfer policy. While German investors usually aim ata one-to-one transfer of their firm specific production model11 (which is not nec-essarily a German or a pure German one), they only rather selectively transferthe German Model of labour practices. And they do so, even taking into accountthe growing heterogeneity of HRM and IR practices in Germany. Thus all Hun-garian affiliates in our case studies turned out to be hybrids, with a rather strongbut not exclusive German influence in technology, production and work organi-sation and a rather strong Hungarian influence in HRM and IR practices.6.2.Transfer ProcessLooking at the transfer process, other differences become apparent. Especiallylarge firms with many (more or less comparable) subsidiaries all over the world(such as Siemens or Heidelberger Zement) followed a very structured approachtowards the whole transfer process. Guided by a clear (sometimes codified)transfer blueprint (including a strict time frame), the transfer process itself wasmanaged by an experienced multifunctional and multicultural team. Comparedto that, the transfer process at many of the smaller companies was much lessstructured and relied more on the individual capacity of single expatriate man-agers from the German investor, who in many cases were intrinsically motivatedeither by a career step associated with the new task or because they are ofHungarian descent or have other personal relationships to Hungary. Sometimesmanagers from third companies were hired to carry out the transfer and to runthe Hungarian affiliate later-on.While there was a common complaint, that there is a strong lack of localmanagement personnel, that complies with the expectations of the German10 However, whether this is a question of size, as argued by Bluhm (2001) and/or a questionof market orientation needs to be explored in greater detail.11 With regard to a few acquisitions, a one-to-one transfer was not feasible, due to existingproduction means.15investors (i.e. speaking German and having state-of-the-art management and/ortechnical know how), notably different strategies were followed with regard tolocal management personnel: Despite the skill gap, a few companies assignedthe local management a core role from the outset (e.g. Balluff, HeidelbergerZement). Most investors, however, first trained local management personnel(sometimes in a very structured way, e.g. at Siemens), that later took over thetasks of the expatriate managers leaving. Finally, there were also a few caseswhere the expatriates were and still are very dominant (e.g. Nordenia, FHP).As a general rule, there was no or only weak training to prepare the expatri-ates for their task in Hungary. Compared to that, the Hungarian management aswell as the Hungarian production workers got rather intensive training (whetherthis was sufficient or not, is another question). Usually these efforts concentrateon an on-the-job training at the German headquarter and/or at related factoriesin the MNC. In many cases, these factories were not necessarily located inGermany. E.g. in the Siemens case, all training took place in Austria. At Norde-nia, machine workers from Hungary were sent to different affiliates all over theworld, depending on where a similar machine to the one in question in Hungaryhad recently been installed. Training efforts also included on-the-job-training inthe Hungarian subsidiary carried out by personnel from the headquarters orfrom other subsidiaries of the MNC, temporarily transferred to the Hungarianplant. Finally, especially machine suppliers and to a somewhat lesser extentconsulting firms played an important role in transferring skills and knowledge toHungary. Both were not necessarily of German origin, too.Almost all companies reported frequent emergency visits of headquarterpersonnel (managers, technicians) at the beginning of their investments, andlater a decreasing or increasing intensity of headquarters presence at the Hun-garian subsidiary, depending on the actual intensity of the transfer process, thatis usually carried out in a sequence of single transfer steps (or projects). Thissheds light on the fact that beyond a necessary minimum transfer, the floor isopen for different degrees regarding the “completeness” of the transfer. Forone, it is rather obvious that all companies who had (März) or still have morethan one factory of the same type in Hungary (Salamander, Heidelberger Ze-ment) prefer to focus most of their transfer and investment efforts on one oftheir Hungarian affiliates. Two, in some of our cases it was reported that thevery favourable cost structure of Hungary till 1996/1997 led to incompletetransfers with regard to the level of efficiency and quality. With the worsening ofthe international cost position of Hungary (no adequate devaluation of the Forintcompared to inflation for the last three years), especially companies, that aim atlow cost export production (such as Salamander or FHP, that are working underthe OPT regime) come under severe pressure, that will eventually either lead toa "completion" of the transfer process, or to a relocation of the production out ofHungary.167.ConclusionsUnlike orthodox institutionalist thinking our empirical cases reveal that - keepingboth home and host country stable - there is still a lot of heterogeneity incorporate internationalisation. Companies do vary with regard to what aspectsof their industrial model they transfer abroad, and to what extend these trans-fers occur. In our empirical cases all companies aimed at a one-to-one-transferof their firm specific production model, and thus mirrored the heterogeneityinherent in the German Model (e.g. with regard to the dichotomy of low skill,Fordist type and high skill Post-Fordist type of production). Big differences how-ever occurred concerning the export of their respective labour practices. Here itturned out that only the rather large German MNCs and those (smaller) GermanMNC, that assigned their Hungarian subsidiary a strategic role for the future ofthe whole MNC, showed a tendency to strongly reproduce their home countrybehaviour abroad (although the reproduction was far from being complete).Furthermore some of our cases raise serious doubts about the questionwhether all German MNCs transfer something like a German Model. Followingthe long and intense debate about lean production, Kanban and the like, someof the German firms studied, can hardly be seen as maintaining a pure Germanindustrial model, since many aspects thereof (with the notable exception of IRpractices) looked rather Japanese. Thus, there is already a hybridisation at thesource of the transfer. In addition, in some cases both the transfer of physicalassets as well as the transfer of knowledge did (sometime very systematically)involve other than German units of the MNC in question, in some cases even(foreign) organisations outside the MNC (such as machine suppliers or consul-tancies undertaking training measures).Finally there was also a striking heterogeneity in the quality of the transferprocess, with the large MNCs following a much more structured approach thanmost of the small and medium sized MNCs. Despite the fact that in none of theten cases examined, the transfer really failed, it is obvious that in those caseswhere the transfer process was rather chaotic and incomplete a higher risk for afurther relocation exists, with severe drawbacks for the Hungarian subsidiaryguaranteed and problems for the whole MNC (especially for the smaller ones)being rather likely.17Literature<ref>Bartlett, C. and Ghoshal, S.
