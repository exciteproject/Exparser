In spite of the independent character of the analyses and of the mostof the empirical observations and results reported here, there is something which unites them all, namely acertain similarity in looking at things from a political culture perspective. Moreover, there is something elsewhich unites their perspectives over the Eastern European political cultures: a certain look from inside. Thetrue motivation for what joins them all in this volume could be described as a need for explanation, nomatter the different political and culture heritages of the countries, regimes, institutions and people targetedby the researches reported in this volume.It is this need for explanation which makes the true binding – either implicit or explicit – of thisvolume. What makes these few Eastern European political culture researches reported here prove thesame need for explanation is the way they share the perception of the post-1989 Eastern Europeandemocracy experience, and certain stereotypes in relating variate political phenomenology to politicalculture.Corresponding Author: Camelia Florela Voinea, Associate ProfessorAffiliation: Faculty of Political Science, University of Bucharest, RomaniaAddress: #24, St. Stephan Street, 023997 Bucharest, Romaniae-mail: camelia.voinea@fspub.unibuc.roCopyright @ 2014 Camelia Florela VoineaEuropean Quarterly of Political Attitudes and Mentalities - EQPAM, Volume3, No.1, January 2014, Book Presentation, pp. 68-74.ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN–L 2285 – 4916Open Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 68Camelia Florela Voinea: “Eastern European Political Cultures and the Need for Explanation. The Look from Inside”EQPAM Vol.3 No.1 January 2014ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916The need for explanation should not surprise anybody, especially if we are to study the EasternEuropean politics. Nevertheless, it is more than just the necessity to explain (what?) and how? is going onin politics. It is also the need to understand why?, when?, or what for? The long transition processes fromthe communist to democratic regimes made almost all Eastern European people and their countriesexperience during the past two decades the need to explain their choices, values, beliefs, norms, attitudes,and symbols. Their grievances or prejudices. Their institutions, regimes, and discourses. All these entail adeep understanding of both remote cultural roots and current political perceptions, steadiness andvariability, contingency and necessity, change and resistance to change. They require not only to explainthings. First and foremost, they require a concept, a paradigm, and a method. It often requires a model.The modeling idea is as old as our philosophical thinking. It reminds us of Plato and makes us thinkabout the city, world, society and politics as of imperfect shadows of one perfect idea. To understand them,we need first of all to overlap the “real” and the “ideal”, the “shadows” and the “model”. It is this overlappingwhich explains what the real construct – be it society or polity, tradition or institution, individual action orpolicy – actually needs in order to identify itself with the ideal construct.Modeling is, as a matter of fact, a relevant component of Political Science: ideology, politicalregime, state, governance or voting – all of them have been modeled and analyzed by means of models.Before anything else, a model “explains” the real world by capturing few but universal laws,principles. It thus makes both modeler and user develop expectations with respect to its explanative power.Whether these are finally fulfilled or not, this depends on the model. In the classical approach, models asexplanative tools involve covering laws. For example, economic laws and ideas do explain thetransformation processes in the Eastern European newly appeared democracies, but they cannot fullyexplain them, and obviously not them all.After the first decade following the 1989- Eastern European political phenomena, students ofdemocracy identified the main characteristics of the Eastern European transition to democratic regimeprocesses and tried to explain their unfolding. It was probably the first time when many agreed that, beyondeconomical difficulties, there were some others which did not fit this model and resisted explanations basedon covering economical laws. Explaining politics requires more than social, economical and financialmethodologies altogether: it requires political methodology. Moreover, it requires a political methodologyable to reconsider such issues like variability, context-, path- and initial conditions dependence in order toexplain one of the fundamental questions in the post-1989 political analysis and methodology (Tilly, 1995):how should we study the political change? – Long after the 1989 Eastern European political phenomena,people still argued on the nature of political change, on its real target and on its real means and ends.Invariable models of political change could not tackle anymore the complexity of the political history andfailed to fulfill the need for explanation of both scholars, either old or young, and of the people, eitherordinary people or elites.Unavoidably, political culture came to the front. In spite of the hard critics and apparently neverending disputes, political culture theories have suceeded to find room for “impressive” coming-backs(Mishler and Pollack, 2003) and for managing ambiguity in definitions and terminology. It is not the first timewhen they do come back and, most probably, not the last. However, this time there is something missing inthe room: explanative power requires explanative methodology. And a good explanation methodologycannot ignore or avoid modeling. Nevertheless, it is modeling which is actually missing in this room.The past two decades have been known as a time of intensive theoretical and empirical researchin Eastern European political cultures. Remarcable works have been published by now famous authors:“The Power of Symbols against the Symbols of Power. The Rise of Solidarity and the Fall of StateSocialism in Poland” (Jan Kubik, 1994), “Modernization and Postmodernization: Cultural, Economic andOpen Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 69European Quarterly of Political Attitudes and Mentalities EQPAMVol.3, No.1, January 2014ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916Political Change in 41 Societies” (Ronald Inglehart,1997), “Democracy and Its Alternatives: UnderstandingPost-Communist Societies” (Richard Rose, William Mishler, and Christian Haerpfer 1998), “Can DemocracyTake Root in Post-Soviet Russia? Explorations in State-Society Relations” (Harry Eckstein, Frederick J.Fleron, E. P. Hoffmann, and William M. Reisinger (Eds.), 1998), “Eastern Europe: Politics, Culture, andSociety Since 1939” (S. Ramet (Ed.), 1998), “Political Culture In Post-communist Europe: Attitudes in NewDemocracies” (Detlef Pollack, Jorg Jacobs, Olaf Muller, Gert Pickel (Eds.), 20003), “Political Culture andPost-Communism”, Stephen Whitefield (Ed.), 2005), “Democracy and Political Culture in Eastern Europe”(Hans-Dieter Klingeman, Dieter Fuchs and Jan Zielonga (Eds.), 2006), to name but few of the mostrelevant ones. Many books and articles of these and other authors represent now the foundation of adifficult work of disentangling the complicated historical and political heritages of the Eastern Europeanpolitical cultures, aimed at understanding how people, cultures and polities endured altogether the hardexperiences of the communist regimes. All these major theoretical works have been published soon after1989, when the Eastern Europeans were struggling and striving in the sophisticated transition processestoward democratization and economic stability. It was a time of high political contend. However, more thantwo decades have passed and, notwithstanding its weakness and scarcity, the democratic constructionhas provided a chance for reflection. As the time passed, the Eastern Europeans – citizens as well aselites – got enough distance from their personal experiences, sentiments and passions so as to be able tofinally reflect as objectively as possible with respect to their communism and post-communism experiences.While much of the research works mentioned earlier were fundamentally about a look from outside, finally,a look from inside is now possible. How valuable it is right now or could be when compared with the above-mentioned high-level expertise works, depends on how much it suceeds to uncover its thick political cultureroots. This volume is about this look from inside.The volume is divided in four sections, ballancing the interest for theoretical modeling with that forcomputational modeling and simulation of political phenomena.The 1st Section, “Theoretical Models”, concern theoretical modeling and introduces one researchwork which reviews major researches in the area of structure of political attitudes (structure of ideology)during the past 80 years in Europe. The author, Bojan Todosijević, explains how political attitude andstructure of ideology studies would impact the modeling of political action, especially in the EasternEuropean new democracies.The 2nd Section, “Political Culture Computational and Simulation Modeling Studies”, concerncomputational modeling and simulation of political action, policy, and polity. The three research worksincluded here address the political action modeling (Bruce Edmonds), the polity simulation modeling(Camelia Florela Voinea), and the modeling of corruption, extortion and fiscal evasion phenomena (MartinNeumann).The 3rd Section, “Political Culture Analysis”, provides empirical comparative results on politicalculture vs. rational choice models, and proves their implications on the mass support for democracy in theEastern European post-communist countries (Zoran Pavlovic).The 4th Section, “EU Non-State Partnership Modeling”, includes one research work on the politicalculture of EU partnership in the non-member states: the European Neighborhood Policy as a politicalculture model of partnership in the European politics (Sima Rakutiene).The 5th Section, “Welfare Culture Studies”, presents one modeling approach on welfare culture inGreece, combining governance, welfare economics and social assitance studies with public policymodeling (Dimitrios Kotroyannos, Stylianos Tzagkarakis, Apostolos Kamekis and Marinos Chourdakis).The Conclusions (Camelia Florela Voinea) presents a general Eastern European picture of politicalculture studies, including several other authors and research works besides those contributing to theOpen Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 70Camelia Florela Voinea: “Eastern European Political Cultures and the Need for Explanation. The Look from Inside”EQPAM Vol.3 No.1 January 2014ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916present volume. The Conclusions show that the Eastern European political culture research exhibitspreferences for a particular relationship between (i) the political values, identity, behaviors and attitudesmodeling, on the one hand, and for (ii) the generative simulation modeling of political phenomena, on theother hand. This relationship is described as a political methodological relationship between politicalmechanisms and political cultures.Getting back to the rationale of this volume, we should emphasize again the independent characterof the researches presented in this volume. It is important to do this for three reasons. One relates theirindependent character to the reality that Eastern European political science research is guided from withinthe society, and this proves both the awareness of researchers and the social utility of their approaches.Another one relates the scarce appearances of political culture modeling research in Eastern Europe to thescarcity of its research funding, which seriously limits its development, but nevertheless cannot stop it. Andfinally, a third reason concerns the extension of political culture theories so as to include new elementsprovided by the interdisciplinary research in areas like European welfare culture or neighborhood culture,which emerged from latest political unfoldings in Eastern and Southern Europe following either 2008economical crisis or EU partnership policies.First, although independently developed, some of the Eastern European political analysisresearches included in the volume share a major theoretical tendency towards modeling approaches ofpolitical issues, including political action and political attitude, voting behavior and electoral campaigns,political messages and political images on the Eastern European electoral market, post-communistinstitutional authority and legitimacy, ethnicity and nationalism, constitutionalism and autoritarianism,corruption and extortion, and many others. As political methodology, Eastern European politicalphenomena modeling research reported in this volume addresses fundamental issues concerning (1) thetype of democracy constructs elaborated by the Eastern European countries, and (2) political identity,sovereignity and political action of the new Eastern European democracies inside EU or outside EU, butexpecting for the EU intergration. As concerning the type of democratic construct and democracyperception in each Eastern European country, these researches share the idea of political cultures asinfluence factors in the political change modeling.From this perspective, two authors succeed to bring to the front old political culture research issuesand to provide fresh answers.Bojan Todosijević’s research on the structure of political attitudes reports fundamentalapproaches during the past almost hundred years in the area of structure of ideology. Political attitudesmade the subject of political analysis and political methodology from the beginning of the 20th century.Todosijević systematically reports research on attitudes in Social Psychology emphasizing the differencebetween the long tradition and huge number of theoretical and analytical works, on the one hand, and theirlow level of impact on the attitude methodological research and development, on the other hand. He is apromoter of the idea that ideological dimensions have a relevant impact on the political behavior. Suchorientation of research would not only help understanding political action, but has a special relevance in theEastern European political space, where the communist ideology’s late impact has shaped “atypicalideological configurations” (p. 35 in this volume). This idea points to the particular ways in which citizens inthe Eastern European post-communist regimes “organize and express their basic political views” (ibid.).The study of political attitudes (formation, stability, structure, expression) in Eastern Europe would thus helpin modeling the type of Eastern European democratic construct and explaining the atypical politicalbehavior – a major concern in the EU structures, where the Eastern European democratic consolidationprocesses raise difficult problems, even long after the political integration of the new Eastern Europeandemocracies.Open Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 71European Quarterly of Political Attitudes and Mentalities EQPAMVol.3, No.1, January 2014ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916Though from a slightly different perspective, but still in the same area of political attitude researchlike Bojan Todosijević’, Zoran Pavlovic addresses the issue of mass democratic expression and supportfor democracy in the Eastern European ex-communist regimes by introducing a comparative analysisbetween two competing explanative models of political behavior: political culture vs. rational choice. Hispost-elections survey research allows for the definition, empirical observation and analysis of socio-demographic, institutional and cultural predictors of the mass support for democracy. His variance modelingapproach re-iterates the disputes concerning the explanative power of the defined survey variables. Hisapproach tries to show the role the political values play in the development of a democratic political culturein a transitional society by influencing the consolidation of the democratic institutions. Pavlovic’s approachgives support to the theories relating political values and institutions by arguing in favor of combining effectsof cultural and institutional variables. His preference assumes actually an Eastern European stereotypemodel of “creating the democratic political culture” by “creating ‘democrats’ as well as creating democracy”(p. 136 in this volume). This position if often encountered in the current Eastern European literature onattitude, behavior and mentality in transition to democracy and consolidation of democratic institutions andproves once more the similarity in the preferences, understandings and expectation analysis of manyEastern European authors (Srbljinovic, 2012; Atanasov and Cvetanova, 2012; Petričušić, 2013; Ferić andLamza-Posavec, 2013) .Second, although quite few and disparate, the researches included in this volume prove a highinterest and a considerable potential for research development in the area of political culture-basedcomputational modeling and simulation of political phenomena. The issue seems rather strange for many ofthe works on political methodology published lately in Eastern Europe. For many reasons, computationalmodeling and simulations appears to Eastern European Political Science researchers as a remote area ofresearch and development. Without being some particular weakness of the Eastern European researchonly, computational and simulation modeling has puzzled political methodology experts from allover theworld by introducing a different concept on how we should describe and explain political phenomena.Following the example of Social Simulation, computational modeling and simulation has been accepted inPolitical Science as well. This volume succeeds to aggregate some disparate approaches on this modelingarea and issues. The three research works presented in the 2nd Section of the volume address both theontology and epistemology of political culture modeling, with a special focus on political methodology.In his chapter on cognitive modeling of political action, Bruce Edmonds introduces the problem ofrelating modeling methodology with political phenomenology. He highlights the issues of abstracting thetypes, levels and granularity of social and political phenomenology by means of computational cognitivemodeling descriptions of social actions, norms, interactions and goal-driven behaviors. As one of theleading experts in both social complexity modeling and agent-based social simulation, Edmonds challengesthe standard artificial society model by introducing elements of cognitive complexity in the individual agentdescriptions. As a computational and simulation modeling approach, this endeavour brings to the front thenow classical debate on the individual agency and the relationship between cognitive, social and politicalphenomena which might get computational and simulation expression in an artificial society model. Themodel he proposes actually challenges the classical KISS style (Axelrode, 1995), and extends therepresentation issue to a methodological issue in political action modeling.Camelia Florela Voinea challenges both political methodology and simulation modeling of politicalphenomena. In her chapter, she addresses several issues in political phenomena modeling, like politicalmechanisms, processes and pathways, reviewing and revisiting some of their definitions and terminology.In addressing the political mechanism issue, Voinea answers the Tilly’s well-known claim (1995) for achange in political phenomena modeling methodology by introducing both emergence and downwardOpen Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 72Camelia Florela Voinea: “Eastern European Political Cultures and the Need for Explanation. The Look from Inside”EQPAM Vol.3 No.1 January 2014ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916causation modeling in the generative simulation architectures. Inspired by the artificial society models, sheintroduces an operational concept of the generative simulation architecture in the artificial polity model. Herresearch aims at advancing the political phenomena modeling theory by including cross-recurrence andcross-recursivity in generative process descriptions. Voinea’s approach addresses the need for amethodological shift towards complexity-based models in political phenomena modeling. In a much similarway to Edmonds’ approach, her work combines both philospohy of science and virtual experiments ofsimulation modeling.Martin Neumann focuses more on computational modeling by generalizing ontologies of Mafia-type systems to an artificial society model able to simulate the emergence and growth of extortion systems.Neumann uses his previous social simulation experience to develop computational models of social andpolitical corruption which could allow for public policy modeling aimed at controlling the phenomenology ofpolitical and bureaucratic corruption. What makes his approach interesting for the theme of this volume isthe use of agent-based system simulation in the development of a political culture model of a mafia-typesocial configuration inside an artificial society. His ontology identifies elements of political culture whichexist and could generate deviant behavior in any kind of society, especially in the weak new democraciessituated at the margins of the Eastern Europe. Extortion ontologies is but one example of how can they beused to develop models of culture and explain the generation of subcultures.Third, the researches on European political culture prove a tendency to extend their area byincluding new issues which emerged from the latest political developments in Eastern and SouthernEurope. This explains the presence in this volume of two approaches on European welfare culture and EUnon-state partnership culture.Sima Rakutiene introduces a model of EU neighborhood culture which captures the non-statepartnership experiences associated lately to the EU accession and integration pending processes in non-member countries, like Lithuania, the Baltic states as well as some of the South-Eastern states.Rakutiene’s model description might suggests that computational and simulation modeling of such politicalphenomena should take into consideration revisiting the agent definition in agent-based systems, in whichagents are usually described as either individuals, organizations or (nation)-states. Non-state actors mightinvolve a complexity approach to agent definition and agency concept in artificial society and polity models.Dimitrios Kotroyannos and his doctoral students, Stylianos Tzagkarakis, Apostolos Kamekisand Marinos Chourdakis introduce a model of welfare culture which is being developed in a Greeknational education and social assistance research project. The welfare concept is usually related to theeconomic welfare theories. This approach suggests the extension of political culture area so as to includewelfare issues. Welfare culture modeling points to the subculture emergence in societies under economicaland political stress – an issue which has not been approached so far in the literature on social modeling.As it is, this volume highlights the Eastern European political culture modeling research resources,tendencies and methodological contributions. It aims at introducing young Eastern European authors andtheir researches and provides a signal that political methodology research needs further consideration,funding and networking in Eastern Europe and not only.References<ref>1.
