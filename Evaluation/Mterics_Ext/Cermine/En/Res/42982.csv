Leading ChangeThe Role of the Principles for Responsible Management EducationANDREAS RASCHE AND MANUEL ESCUDERO*244*11. ‘Let’s not waste a good crisis!’Without doubt, the context of responsible management education has changed overthe last twelve months. Business schools1 are accused of being partly responsible forthe current economic crisis because they have failed to seriously integrate reflectionson ethical values into their curricula (Holland 2009; Jacobs 2009). Of course, we couldlament more about the status of responsible management education (or rather the lackof much of a status). But why not take this crisis as an opportunity to lead change?Why not look into the future and use this crisis to finally champion responsible man-agement education? While the economic downturn surely has remarkable negativeeffects on peoples’ lives around the globe, it also creates a lot of promise, not least forthe further dissemination and upscaling of responsible management education. Thetime is ripe for leading change with regard to responsible management education, inGermany and elsewhere. We are living in difficult and promising times, or as ÁngelCabrera (2009), President of Thunderbird School of Global Management, arguedrecently: “Let’s not waste a good crisis!”The argument which we would like to present here is as follows. When consideringthe changing context of responsible management education – mostly driven by therecent global economic downturn but also by a more general suspicion that businessschools cannot deliver what they promise – we should not waste this opportunity tofinally put responsible management education in its rightful place: at the strategic coreof the business school curriculum. We propose to consider the Principles for ResponsibleManagement Education (abbreviated PRME, pronounced ‘prime’) as one possible changeagent to drive this process. The PRME embody a voluntary set of principles to whichbusiness schools can adhere in the interest of providing future leaders with the neces-sary insights and skills to reflect upon, critically analyze, and provide leadership withregard to corporate responsibility.________________________Dr. Andreas Rasche, Warwick Business School, The University of Warwick, CV4 7AL Coventry,United Kingdom, phone:+44-(0)24-7657-3131, e-mail: andreas.rasche@wbs.ac.uk; research inter-ests: corporate responsibility and governance, United Nations Global Compact, responsiblesupply chain management.

This, however, should not indicatethat our remarks are limited to business schools. In particular, the PRME can also be adopted byentire universities or universities of applied sciences.2.A ‘Window of Opportunity’ to Champion Responsible ManagementEducationWe think there are at least two recent developments which should put responsiblemanagement education into the centre of business school’s strategic positioning.From our perspective, both debates create a ‘window of opportunity’ to finally startintegrating responsible management education into the curricula and research prac-tices of business schools. We consider these developments to be as much of relevancefor German academic institutions as they are for the rest of the world.First, there is the discussion around whether business school education (or rather thelack of it) is to blame for the recent financial crisis. Of course, no one would seriouslyclaim that academic institutions are exclusively responsible for the economic down-turn. However, it cannot be neglected that business schools educated many of thosepeople who contributed to the current crisis in one way or another. Many commenta-tors raise doubts about whether business school education in general and MBA pro-grams in particular adequately prepare students for the ethical challenges they face intheir later careers. The Wall Street Journal, for instance, argues that business schools, byfailing to systemically and critically discuss issues such as executive incentive pro-grams, have contributed to the financial crisis (Jacobs 2009). Likewise, The New YorkTimes wonders whether “the way business students are taught may have contributed tothe most serious economic crisis in decades” (Holland 2009). The bottom line is thatwe cannot solely neglect that business schools have a responsibility to train their stu-dents in a responsible way. As James Post (2009) remarked recently in the FinancialTimes, “schools must now reinvent themselves as part of the solution”.Second, there is the argument that business schools’ overemphasis on market mecha-nisms and the importance of companies’ stock prices failed to teach students that theyare part of a profession which is responsible for more than shareholder value(Khurana 2007). Management, as Khurana argues, is as much a profession as medicineor law. Business schools, however, never taught their students that they were part of aprofession and thus expected to uphold basic ethical values. While it would be naïveto believe that professionalization of the management field would ipso facto makegraduates more responsible, it is not unreasonable to suppose that a professionaliza-tion (e.g., expressed through a widely accepted code of conduct) could at least help tochange business schools’ culture and foster students’ reflections. In other words, thecurrent crisis has presented us, and the public at large, with the evidence that man-agement carries with its decisions an important (positive or negative) social impact. Inthat sense, management is a profession that has to do with the common public good.Hence, infusing the sense of responsibility in future leaders and professionals aboutthe social and environmental impact of management decision-making should be con-sidered a central concern in business education from now on.Related to this debate around the professional social risks of management decision-making, some schools are considering the introduction of an oath for managers. Thun-derbird, for instance, introduced a ‘Professional Oath of Honor’ about four years ago.zfwu 10/2 (2009), 244-250245246“The Code has helped change our academic culture by shaping conversationsinside and outside the classroom. We are yet to prove empirically whether theinitiative will have a meaningful impact on the professional conduct of ourgraduates, but third party assessments indicate that our students may be moresensitive to the broader set of social responsibilities of managers than the aver-age MBA student.” (Cabrera 2009)Trying to change education through a commitment to a set of aspirational/inspirationalprinciples, like PRME, is as much needed as to give incentives for such a changethrough an ‘oath’ at the end of the educational period. Obviously, as in the debatesome 20 years ago on quality control in the company, a final quality control does notpreclude Total Quality Management throughout the entire production process. Thus,it is not only time to rethink what is being taught in business schools, but to also ques-tion the pillars upon which management education was built.The two described developments are particularly interesting for German businessschools as there has been a steep increase in MBA programmes over the last couple ofyears, either to meet rising local demand and/or to better position academic institu-tions in the increasingly competitive global business school landscape. While this de-velopment is certainly appreciable, there is also a risk that German business schoolswill more or less ‘blindly’ follow the traditional North American MBA model (with itsoveremphasis on teaching students how to handle hard data and come up with quicksolutions; Mintzberg 2005). Considering the abovementioned ‘window of opportunity’to champion and upscale responsible management education, German businessschools should not waste this crisis to finally come to grips with integrating corporateresponsibility issues into the curriculum. We believe that joining the global PRMEnetwork can support German business schools in building up capacity with regard toresponsible management education, learning from the achievements and failures ofother academic institutions, and thus being able to lead the change (instead of follow-ing it). Hence, the PRME should be perceived as one possible, yet by no means theonly, way to building up a strategic approach towards responsible management educa-tion which clearly reaches beyond isolated courses on ‘business ethics’.3.One Answer – The PRMEThe PRME reflect a change agent for responsible management education; a changeagent which relies on the voluntary commitment of participating academic institu-tions. Similar to the United Nations Global Compact, the PRME are not a certificationstandard to ensure that a business school has complied with certain principles (Rasche2009). Much like the Global Compact, the PRME, at the macro-level, provide a plat-form where interested institutions can exchange ideas and best practices, while, at themicro-level, they are supposed to stimulate and guide a school’s development of re-sponsible management education. The following six principles act as a ‘walking stick’assisting those institutions which are willing to promote and champion responsiblemanagement education:(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)We will develop the capabilities of students to be future generators of sustain-able value for business and society at large and to work for an inclusive and sus-tainable global economy.We will incorporate into our academic activities and curricula the values ofglobal social responsibility as portrayed in international initiatives such as theUnited Nations Global Compact.We will create educational frameworks, materials, processes and environmentsthat enable effective learning experiences for responsible leadership.We will engage in conceptual and empirical research that advances our under-standing about the role, dynamics, and impact of corporations in the creationof sustainable social, environmental and economic value.We will interact with managers of business corporations to extend our knowl-edge of their challenges in meeting social and environmental responsibilitiesand to explore jointly effective approaches towards meeting these challenges.We will facilitate and support dialogue and debate among educators, business,government, consumers, media, civil society organizations and other interestedgroups and stakeholders on critical issues related to global responsibility andsustainability.At first glance the six principles may look very general. However, it is essential to con-sider that there is a certain necessary contextual ‘emptiness’ when developing and im-plementing global principles because the contexts that business schools operate in maydiffer considerably (e.g., when looking at differences in legal systems and/or existingnorms and values regarding education). Each participating institution needs to reflectupon (and thus show commitment to) what the six principles mean in practice. Forexample, the third principle regarding educational frameworks and learning materialscan be implemented through quite different actions depending on factors such as classsize and available resources (e.g., money to purchase case studies). At the same time, awhole new approach, experiential learning is being opened up in the context ofPRME, and that debate will only progress through a process of exchange of best prac-tices by leading PRME signatories. The point is to not believe that the six principleswill tell educational institutions what to do, but to acknowledge that schools need to‘fill’ these six principles with contextualized and innovative meaning based on reflec-tions and peer discussions.Participating institutions are expected to enter into a process of continuous improve-ment taking the six principles as a guiding idea about where to start and what to do.To inspire and foster mutual learning among institutions, the PRME require an annualreporting on progress. Reports are supposed to stimulate discussions, enable learning,disseminate ideas and allow participating institutions to set the agenda for responsiblemanagement education, both within organizations and in the wider socio-economicenvironment. It should also be pointed out that the PRME are not a membership ini-tiative (i.e. an initiative which charges a membership fee in order to join the network).A key strength of principle-based initiatives, such as the Global Compact or the PRME,is that they allow for experimentation and innovation on the side of participants. Asinnovation cannot be regulated but evolves out of the commitment of participants,zfwu 10/2 (2009), 244-250247248business schools should view the PRME as a step to finding and sharing new solu-tions and ideas towards responsible management education (Waddock et al. 2009).The PRME grew in part because business leaders, who have committed themselves tothe ten principles of the Global Compact, were asking educational institutions: Whatare you doing to help future business leaders to understand the challenges of responsible management?Any serious and long-term consideration of responsible management needs to includeeducational institutions as important players, particularly when reflecting upon thelessons we have learned from the recent financial crisis. Educational institutions notonly provide factual knowledge about responsible business practices, but also (andmaybe most importantly) have the ability to encourage students’ reflection about theirvalues. Considering this role of higher educational institutions, the PRME were devel-oped between October 2006 and July 2007 by an international task force of 60 Deans,University Presidents, as well as scholars committed to the idea of responsible man-agement education. To enhance the multi-stakeholder nature and perceived legitimacyof the development process, the drafting of the principles was supported by represen-tatives from the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the Association to Ad-vance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), the Aspen Institute’s Business andSociety Program, the European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD),the Globally Responsible Leadership Initiative (GRLI), Net Impact, a student organi-zation with more than 13,000 members, the Graduate Management Admission Coun-cil (GMAC), and the European Academy of Business in Society (EABIS). All of theseinstitutions remain partners of the initiative as they are members of the steering com-mittee which guides the PRME.In July 2007, the outcome of this development process was presented to UN Secre-tary-General Ban Ki-moon at the triennial Global Compact Leaders Summit in Geneva.During its first two years of existence, the initiative witnessed a tremendous growth interms of participating institutions (from around 40 in July 2007 to more than 270 inNovember 2009). The enormous interest in the PRME and its underlying idea wasalso reflected by the high participation rate in the first Global Forum for Responsible Man-agement Education held at UN headquarters in December 2008.4.The PRME in Germany – The Benefits of ParticipationWhereas the initiative is currently approaching 270 signatories from all five continents,only twelve participating institutions are located in Germany. Hence, the PRME –although a global success story to date – have not made it onto the agenda of mostGerman business schools. We could speculate about possible reasons for this reserva-tion to join the initiative (e.g., ranging from the historically weak position of ‘businessethics education’ in German universities to concerns about the Principles being per-ceived as constraining the traditionally important freedom of teaching and researchwithin universities). Instead of speculating about possible constraints, we would like tohighlight selected reasons for signing up to the initiative hoping to convince decisionmakers to think of the PRME as a change agent for their institutions.First, any institution which joins the PRME enjoys the benefits of being a recognizedleader with regard to responsible management education. The recent ‘credit crunch’has shown that an adaptation process within the global economy is inevitable. Thisforecasts a ‘race to the top’ where the landscape of leading institutions will be re-shaped, and where the leaders of the not too distant tomorrow will be those businessschools who trigger a process of innovation and adaptation to the new environment,placing at the center of their educational activities the core values and concepts ofsustainability and corporate social responsibility. This process will put corporate re-sponsibility center stage and thus create more demand for ethics courses throughoutthe curriculum from students and potential employers alike. According to Blaine(2009), most schools have already witnessed a steep increase in ethics-related courseswhich has put responsible management education in its rightful place. The PRME cansupport and foster this process and help German academic institutions to be per-ceived as leaders in the field of responsible management education.Second, the PRME can act as an internal change agent when trying to advance thecurriculum in favour of a transversal updating of all disciplines, from finance to mar-keting, operations, human resources management or strategic management. As theprinciples need to be signed by the highest-ranking executive of a business school, it isreasonable to expect that ‘after the signature’ there should be some top-level supportfor pushing ethical issues into the curriculum. Considering the many micro-politicalstruggles within business schools (e.g., between different departments), support andeffective leadership from a high-ranking executive (e.g., the Dean) can help to over-come ideological barriers to create interest and acceptance for ethical issues within thefaculty. This is not to say that the PRME need to be exclusively implemented in a top-down mode. Rather, the backing by high-ranking decision makers should supportgrassroots ideas coming from different parts of the faculty. Our findings, out of theexperience gathered throughout the PRME community, clearly suggest that both atop-down approach and a bottom-up approach are necessary to make progress alongthe lines of PRME.Third, joining the PRME gives access to a strong network of likeminded institutions.The 1st Global Forum for Responsible Management Education, which was held in New YorkCity in December 2008, demonstrated that committed schools have a lot to share andthat access to this network can give a school a competitive edge in times where thebusiness school landscape is becoming evermore competitive. Building capacity andbeing a leader in terms of responsible management education is increasingly rewardedthrough rankings such as the Aspen Institute’s Beyond Grey Pinstripes list and Net Im-pact’s Business as UNusual guide. Considering that German institutions are currentlynot listed in both rankings, the PRME should be perceived as a change agent to posi-tion an institution’s efforts with regard to responsible management education in theglobal business school landscape. This process of ‘catching up’ also creates the oppor-tunity to learn from best practices which other business schools have developed.To conclude, we think there is a lot of promise when considering the current status ofthe PRME, particularly in view of the abovementioned changing context of manage-ment education in general. A growing number of business schools are recognizing thenecessity to better integrate aspects of corporate responsibility into teaching and re-search, and the PRME are a necessary and timely initiative to support this process. Weare positive that German business schools will play a significant role in shaping thefuture discussions and practices around responsible management education in generalzfwu 10/2 (2009), 244-250249250and the PRME in particular. Leading the necessary change requires accepting thatresponsible management has to be one key strategic concern of any business schoolwhich takes the lessons of the current crisis seriously. There could not be a better timethan now to start refocusing business schools’ agendas and practices.References<ref>Blaine, S.
