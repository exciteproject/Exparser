The mediazation ofmedicine on Dutch television, 1961–2000Piet VerhoevenHealth issues and medical science receive a lot of attention on television. Of allthe sciences, the European public is most interested in medicine, and the publicuses television as their main source of information on science. There has beenhardly any empirical research, however, into the historical development of the rep-resentation of medical science on television. The development of medical televi-sion was explored by carrying out a content analysis of Dutch non-fiction medicaltelevision programs spanning a period of 40 years. The speaking time allotted toexperts has decreased over the years, while that allotted to laypeople hasincreased. We are seeing fewer references to sources and science and more expres-sion of emotion and tension. The results suggest three periods of medical televi-sion: a scientific, a journalistic and a lay period. Medical television in 2000 showsa personified picture of patients against an instrumentalized and symbolized med-ical backdrop.1. IntroductionIn Europe and the United States, health issues and medical science receive a lot of attention ontelevision compared to that devoted to other sciences (Göpfert, 1996; Lafollette, 2002;Cheveigné, 2006). Of all the sciences, the European public is also most interested in medicine, andthey use television as their main source of information on science (European Commission, 2001). Astelevision plays such an important role in the way the public gathers information, it would seem tobe important to know how science is represented there, especially since the public debate is drawingattention to the increasing tension between the dumbing-down of media content and the increasingcomplexity of science and daily life (cf. Dawkins, 1998; Hargreaves and Ferguson, 2001). Thedebate suggests that media content has changed over the years. Has media content relating to sciencechanged over time, or is the suggestion based more on myths about media content and the power ofthe media (Schönbach, 2000) than on empirical reality?There has been hardly any empirical research into the historical development of televisioncontent and science (Dawkins, 1998; Loughlin, 2000; Allan, 2002). A study was therefore con-ducted to ascertain whether the use of science on Dutch television changed from 1960 to 2000,and if so, how. This study was carried out against the background of the above-mentioned publicdebate on the dumbing-down of media content, as well as against the background of social theoryabout the logic of the mass media and their role and position in society.© 2008 SAGE PublicationsISSN 0963-6625 DOI: 10.1177/0963662506075352462 Public Understanding of Science 17(4)In some social theoretical perspectives, the development of the media is presented as thecore of the cultural transformation into the modern society (Thompson, 1995), and is closelyrelated to the development of science and technology. Thompson calls the development of themedia the “mediazation of culture,” by which patterns of communication and interaction havechanged in “profound and irreversible ways” (1995: 46). By now, mediazation also includesthe rise of “media logic” (Altheide and Snow, 1979, 1991; van Vree et al., 2003), in which themass media mainly take an entertainment perspective on social and political life, and wheninformation is presented. The concept of mediazation was used as a background in this studyin order to examine the historical development of the representation of science on television.Mediazation was chosen instead of mediatization because mediazation refers primary to cul-tural processes and mediatization seems to become more and more defined as a concept usedto describe the penetration of mass media and their logic into other social systems, e.g. orga-nizations in society (Kepplinger, 2002; Schulz, 2004; Schrott, 2005). This mediatization is notthe focus of this study.Medical science and medical journalismIn this media analysis, medicine is taken as exemplary of the development of the representationof science on television over time. This is for several reasons. First, because of its presencein the media, the importance the public attaches to it and the image medical science has asbeing exemplary of science in general. Inhabitants of the European Union also think that med-ical science is the most scientific compared to other sciences (European Commission, 2001).This confirms earlier research conducted in the United Kingdom (Durant et al., 1992) andCanada (Einsiedel, 1992) that showed that medicine dominates the general image the publichas of science. This suggests that at least for a part of the public, medicine is paradigmatic forscience in general. The image of science in general is determined by the familiarity with andthe image of medical science. As Einsiedel (1992) has said, a typical story about science is astory about medical science, is based on scientific expertise and is a positive occurrence, oftena medical innovation or a treatment.Second, when measuring the attention devoted to science and technology, medicaljournalism can be positioned between general news journalism and science journalism. On thegeneral television news, not much attention is paid to science or technology (León, 2004). Inspecial science programs on television as a part of science journalism the situation is the oppo-site: science and technology are very visible because the broadcasts usually are entirely devotedto science. It can be expected that medical journalism will be positioned somewhere in between.The above considerations seem to make medical journalism suitable for observingchanges over time.2. Theoretical backgroundThe background to the study was the theoretical debate on and arguments concerning thescientification and mediazation of culture and society. If we look at the development ofscience we find it has determined not only the technological processes, economic systems andsocial structures of society but also our everyday experience of the world and consciousthoughts and even unconscious feelings. It is presented as the driving force behind modern-ization (Nowotny et al., 2001), determining every aspect of society. Processes of “scientifica-tion” and “socialization” have led to a science and society that are fundamentally interwoven(cf. Hagendijk, 1996, 2004) and the co-production of a scientificized culture.Verhoeven: Mediazation of medicine 463If we look at the development of the mass media, we find a great deal of attention hasbeen devoted to the role and logic of the media and to the “mediazation of culture”(Thompson, 1995: 46). This has resulted in the transformation of the public sphere, whichnow takes the form more of a mediated publicness than a non-mediated agora for dialogueand debate. Social and political life has become nothing more than a struggle for visibility inthe mass media. Mediazation has entered upon a new phase in recent decades, referred to as“extended mediazation” (Thompson, 1995: 110–11): the media have developed a “relativelyhigh degree of self-referentiality” (Thompson, 1995: 110). Media messages refer more oftento other media messages and to events reported in the media.“Media logic” is said to have replaced the classical journalistic way of working (Altheideand Snow, 1979, 1991; van Vree et al., 2003). It consists of formats for the symbolic repro-duction of events; when it is applied, the form of the communication takes precedence over itscontent. These formats determine how the material is organized and in what style it is pre-sented. They reflect underlying, often implicit rules that apply to the whole media industry,although there are different formats for different subjects, for example for news, entertainment,sports and talk shows. They provide the grammar for media content, they arrange actions andevents, provide temporality and produce symbols that express emotion or are meant to evokeemotions. They are dominated by the “entertainment perspective” (Altheide and Snow, 1979),aiming at entertaining the public instead of informing them. Information presented in anentertainment format is sometimes referred to as “infotainment” (Brants, 1998; Wieten, 2002).News values and news factorsEmpirical research into the content of news has shown that this development towards medialogic and the self-referentiality of the media started as early as the 1950s. Much research hasshown that media content is consistent and that this content mainly can be explained by theworking of the so-called news values and news factors. Following the classical study byGaltung and Ruge (1965), many researchers have worked on extending the news value theory.For example, Schulz (1976, 1982) has shown that the content of the news and its productionare not what one would expect on the basis of the professional norms and ideals of journalists.Important news factors are:● Threshold: the news is about topics that exceed a certain threshold of intensity to benoticed by journalists.● Unambiguity: the news often presents matters as unambiguous.● Consonance: the news is consonant with what journalists and the public have in their minds.● Status: the news is about elite people, nations and institutes.● Dynamics: the news presents the world as constantly changing.● Valence: the news is about success or conflicts.● Identification: the news often presents people who evoke compassion.● Personification: the news is about people with whom the public can identify, people inaction and people’s emotions.Television in the NetherlandsThe historical development of television journalism has also been described as a processtowards the increasing use of media logic. In the 1950s and 1960s, television used modelstaken from the movies, followed by one derived from the press until about 1985. From thenon it started using more and more formats with the characteristics of media logic. Not only464 Public Understanding of Science 17(4)the rise of commercial television but also technological developments are held responsible forthis (Wijfjes, 2002).The Netherlands was one of the last countries in Europe to introduce commercial television(Bakker and Scholten, 2005). Until 1989, Dutch television was public television only. All broad-casters were non-profit organizations. In 1989, commercial television was introduced parallel tothe public broadcasting system. Today, the Netherlands has three public broadcasting channelsand eight national commercial channels (Bakker and Scholten, 2005)The mediazation hypothesisThe question is how the representation of science on television has developed. Has the use ofscience—medical science in this case—on television changed during the past decades, and ifso, how? Or, to put it differently, have the narratives and knowledge of journalists taken overfrom those of scientists and experts in medical television programs, because of increasingmedia logic? The study started out from the mediazation hypothesis, which states that the nar-ratives and knowledge of journalists have become more present in the media over the yearsthan those of scientists and experts.3. MethodologyMedical journalismIn order to answer the research question, a content analysis of a sample of medical documentariesfrom the public broadcasting organizations in the Netherlands was carried out. It was decidedto analyze only non-fiction medical television shows, because this genre of medical televisionwas broadcast throughout almost the entire research period. Although fictional medical tele-vision programs are also relevant, such programs were not broadcast in the Netherlands untilthe late 1980s. Furthermore, quite a lot of research on medical drama series has already beendone (e.g. van Dijck, 2002; Kirby, 2003), in contrast to the amount on medical programs witha predominantly informational character and aim.Sample frame and sampleIt emerged from the archives of the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision that from thestart of Dutch television in 1951 until 2000 over 40 different medical series were producedand broadcast, starting in 1961. This is such a broad and varied universe that a random sam-ple was not suitable for the study. In order to make the historical analysis as internally validas possible, a sampling frame was devised. This sampling frame was made up of a group ofseven consecutive medical television series between 1961 and 2000.1 From this samplingframe a proportionate stratified sample (Neuendorf, 2002) was drawn of two episodes peryear. The resulting sample contained 76 different episodes from 38 different years, with atotal length of 34 hours, 30 minutes and 34 seconds.Operationalization, procedure and analysisMedia content was analyzed at the level of (a) entire episodes and (b) statements, using a con-structed media reference model. This model has two dimensions.The first dimension—referentiality—consists of variables that measure references tosources, references to the rules of science, the educational character of the statements and thespeaking times (following Adatto, 1990) allotted to the persons appearing in the programs. Theoperationalization of the reference to rules of science is based on the Mertonian imperativesVerhoeven: Mediazation of medicine 465(Merton, 1942), usually abbreviated to CUDOS,2 giving rise to such variables as reference tocommunality of knowledge, reference to former knowledge, reference to universality andcausality, and reference to scientific research in statements.The second dimension—news factors and media factors—consists of variables thatmeasure the visibility of these factors, as previously defined by Galtung and Ruge (1965) andSchulz (1976, 1982). News factors can be considered the most important forms of expressionin the mediazation process. The concept of news factors gives rise to such variables as thresh-old and continuity, thematization, elite persons and elite institutions, dynamics, valence (withsuccess on the positive side and tension on the negative side), identification, emotion, per-sonification, contextualization, mentioning of wider implications and presentation of eventsas surprising. Also such variables as the visibility of medical clothing and accoutrements, thediscipline (humanities, hard sciences or social sciences) of the speakers in the episodes, thestoryline, the use of metaphor, speaking directly or indirectly, images presented on the screen,mentioning of risks and moderation of the programs were part of the dimension of news andmedia factors.In total, 31 variables were encoded. Eight variables were coded at whole-episode level,including the speaking times allotted to various persons. This was only possible for the 1976 to2000 period, owing to the availability of episodes; before 1976 the broadcasting organizationsdid not record whole episodes, but only archived filmed reports.After coding the variables of the whole episode, each episode was divided into asequence of statements. A “statement” is the number of seconds during which a person talksbefore he or she is interrupted. In total, 7,242 different statements were identified in programsin the period 1961–2000. A total of 24 variables were coded at the statement level.All the variables and their possible values were defined and described in a code book. Fourcoders encoded the data. A reliability subsample of 10 percent of the statements was drawn tocalculate Scott’s pi (π) (Lombard et al., 2002), which was calculated for the variables encodedat statement level. The inter-coder reliability ranged from 0 to .98.Given the research question, the speaking times allotted to persons were aggregatedannually. Time series were produced from these aggregated data to enable patterns over theyears to be observed.3 To support the interpretation of the patterns a bivariate regressionanalysis was carried out. In order to enable variables to be compared the standardized regres-sion coefficient (β) was reported. In addition to the bivariate regression analysis a one-wayANOVA was conducted to explore significant differences in content in different time periods.4. ResultsSeven consecutive medical series were analyzed, those connected to three television doctors(Dr. van Swol, Dr. Haneveld, Dr. Gisolf) in the 1960s and 1970s, and Vinger aan de pols(“Finger on the Pulse”) in the period 1981–2000. Vinger was the dominant medical programin the Netherlands at the time. It was anchored by medical journalist Ria Bremer, first incooperation with television doctor Dr. Lens and later (after 1987) alone.Speaking timeAn important indicator of the way medical science is represented on television is the speakingtime allotted to the various participants in the programs. Non-fiction medical television programsshow more than seventeen different groups of participants, falling into three categories: experts,journalists and laypersons.466 Public Understanding of Science 17(4)In order to distinguish between different kinds of experts and the different roles expertscan play, the participants in the category experts were encoded into three different subcate-gories: pure scientists, other experts (medical and otherwise) and medical doctors. The totalspeaking time of all these experts together decreased over time. Medical doctors, in differentroles, have by far the largest share of the speaking time of experts, followed by pure scientists.The second category—journalists—also plays various roles in the programs, for example asmoderators or as on-location reporters or commentators. In the third category are laypersons,such as patients and their families and representatives of patient groups and of the general public.Figure 1 shows the speaking times observed in the three categories (i.e. experts, journalistsand laypeople) between 1976 and 2000. From 1976 to 2000 relative speaking times among thethree categories changed greatly. The speaking time allotted to experts decreased significantlyover this period (β = –.373, p < .10) and that allotted to laypersons increased (β = .357, p < .10).The speaking time allotted to journalists did not change significantly from 1976 to 2000 (β =.267, not significant). The pattern of the changes enables three periods to be identified. The firstwas from 1976 to 1980, when experts had the most speaking time (54.7 percent). Televisiondoctors (in the roles of anchorman and doctor) moderated the programs and invited medical spe-cialists and patients and other laypeople (38.9 percent of speaking time) to speak. Journalists(6.4 percent of speaking time) performed a supporting role as on-location reporters and occa-sionally as commentators. Between 1981 and 1987 the pattern changed, with a markedlyincreased role for journalists. In spite of visible cooperation with television doctors, journalistsacquired a larger share of speaking time (36.6 percent). Experts had a smaller share of speakingtime (31.3 percent) and from 1981 onwards the broadcasts no longer featured experts in the roleof scientists. Visible cooperation between television doctors and journalists ceased by 1987,when doctors stopped playing an anchor role: from then on this was performed only by jour-nalists. This period marks the beginning of a new era of speaking time distribution, which sta-bilized further in the third period, from 1988 to 2000: speaking time allotted to expertsdecreased even more (21.9 percent) in favor of laypeople (46.1 percent).Content of the episodesAt episode level, we identified some significant changes in the content of medical television, asshown in Figure 2. The presentation of topics in an impersonal context decreased (β = –.595,p < .001): after 1988, 80 percent of the topics in medical programs were discussed in a personalcontext. Stories were more often personified in the form of specific laypersons, patients andtheir families, and less often in generalized stereotypes with which the public could identify.This is underlined by the decrease in the number of children in the programs as an identifier forthe public (β = –.438, p < .05). Also, topics were less often discussed in a general way, leavingaside the major or minor implications for certain people: not mentioning implications decreasedsignificantly (β = –.697, p < .001). This coincided with a decreasing proportion of non-thema-tized episodes (β = –.737, p < .001). Gradually more attention was devoted to familiar subjectsand persons, with increasing thematization (β = .367, p < .10).The threshold for gaining attention with medical television programs has increased forbasic health problems (everyday topics): interest in these problems has decreased significantly(β = –.595, p < .001) over time.Many of the subjects dealt with in the programs that were produced in the 1960s/1970sare basic health problems: most attention is paid to such matters as pregnancy and childbirth,followed by dental care, accidents involving children, illness and holidays, allergies, venerealdiseases, puberty and so on. Besides these basic health problems, attention is also paid tocancer and to heart and vascular diseases.30002000sdnoceS1000ExpertsVerhoeven: Mediazation of medicine 467LaypeopleJoumalistsemitgnikaepS019761978198019841982198619901988Year19921996199419982000JournalistsExpertsLay peopleFigure 1. Speaking time of experts, journalists and laypeople in Dutch medical televisionprograms, 1976–2000.The 1980s gave rise to a dichotomy between attention to basic health problems and increas-ing attention to such matters as cancer, heart and vascular diseases and organ transplants—areas in which first-class clinical care and technological solutions play an important role. Themajority of the post-1988 programs are about diseases that need first-class clinical care ornew and specialized treatments, such as cancer, heart diseases, AIDS, Huntington’s diseaseand Alzheimer’s disease.Content of the statementsTable 1 summarizes some primary outcomes of the content analysis of statements made byparticipants in medical television programs from 1961 to 2000. The content has changed overtime, as can be seen from the differences in the three periods of speaking time identified.4Until 1988, the statements analyzed included explicit verbal references to sources andscience, operationalized as mentioning sources and speaking about the results or the back-grounds of scientific research, mentioning the validity and the foundation of the claims madein the statement, and referring to previous confirmed knowledge about the subject spokenabout in the statement. After 1988 this was far less the case: reference to sources decreasedsignificantly (β = –.055, p < .001) over the whole period, as did verbal references to science(β = –.097, p < .001, shown in Figure 3).5There was also a decrease in the number of statements explaining medical problems orillnesses (β = –.039, p < .001). The number of educational statements was highest from 1970to 1990; the content of educational statements also changed after 1988, away from the preven-tion and explanation of illnesses towards mainly explaining medical treatments. In addition,the manner in which explanations were given changed, from medical lectures on television in468Public Understanding of Science 17(4)10080604020100806040200197601976aYearYeard8060402002000197610080604020200001976Reference to sourcesExplanatory statementsIndirect speaking by expertsUnambiguous statementsMedical clothing visibleMedical accoutrements visibleExpression of tensionExpression of emotionPresentation of dynamicsElite persons speakingExperts with medical/beta background*p < .05 (post hoc Scheffé test).Total % ofstatementsn = 72422.317.23895.418.218.214.78.612.22524.8c0.5*14*69*96.3*26.7*26.3*16.310*15.2*12.3*13.3*bYearYeare1.7*16.8*30*94.615.7*13.5*10.5*7.37.1*50.7*49.4*Figure 2.

This coincided with an increasing number of statements in medicalprograms where experts spoke indirectly, that is, not addressing the public or the journalistdirectly but being shown talking to patients and families in the consultation room or duringsurgery in the operating theatre.Also the number of unambiguous statements increased significantly after 1988. Althoughthere has never been much ambiguity in medical television programs, it has further diminishedsince 1988.Furthermore, medical experts were presented as merely tools for the treatment of patientsor symbols of the medical or scientific field. After 1988 experts were more often shown wear-ing medical clothing (β = .102, p < .001) and with other medical accoutrements on screen(β = .108, p < .001). The tension and emotion in the programs mounted over time. The pro-portion of statements articulating conflicts and disagreements increased significantly (β =.031, p < .01), especially after 1981, as did the proportion of statements expressing emotions(β = .031, p < .01). Lastly, there was an increasing sense of instability and drama in theprograms: patients’ conditions were increasingly presented as rapidly changing, as can beseen from the growing proportion of statements articulating some kind of unpredictablechange (β = .112, p < .001).5. Conclusions and discussionThe study shows that the way medical science is represented and used in the Dutch mediachanged from 1961 to 2000. There has been an unmistakable tendency towards mediazation.The change seems to be more complex than the mediazation hypothesis suggests, however: itis not a matter of science simply being replaced by journalism. The historical trend shows thatthe roles of the various participants in the programs have changed, starting with a change470 Public Understanding of Science 17(4)in the distribution of the available speaking time, which shows what, on the basis of themediazation hypothesis, is an unexpected development in the role and position of laypeople.The speaking time of laypeople has increased significantly and the speaking time of expertshas decreased significantly.Three different periods were identified on the basis of the observations. The first, from1976 to 1980, could be called the “scientific period,” as the speaking time ratio favors experts.The content analysis of statements indicates that this scientific era started earlier, in 1961. Inthe second period, from 1981 to 1987, journalists took over the anchor role in medicalprograms, hence it could be labeled the “journalistic period.” This marks the beginning of anew distribution in which the speaking time allotted to experts decreased in favor of laypeo-ple. This new distribution intensified and stabilized in the third period, from 1988 to 2000,which could be termed the “lay period.”In the 1980s, journalists started to take the lead in and to give direction to medical televisionprograms. Why this change took place cannot be derived from the content of the programs.On the basis of the content of the programs, it seems that the “factuality regime” in theprograms has changed from a medical science one via a journalistic one to a lay one. A fac-tuality regime is defined by Hagendijk (1996: 186) as a “collection of assumptions, goals,impressions and rules which play a role in the production and evaluation of factual claims.”These journalistic and lay factuality regimes increasingly mask science rules in favor ofan instrumentalized and symbolized image of experts, generally painting a picture of medicalscience as a mere tool. To put it another way, science has become technology, more or lesssimplistically presented as a scenic backdrop to the lives of laypeople. This observationmatches the way news factors function: several of these converged, especially after 1988, inthe direction of personifying laypeople. The speaking layperson is more often a recognizableperson with a personal tale that is followed over a lengthy period of time. This trend is in linewith the “layification” of speaking time in the programs.This layification of the speaking time might be explained by the transformation in thepatient–doctor relationship that occurred between 1961 and 2000, and the rise of patientactivist groups and activism around specific diseases like AIDS (Epstein, 1996) or controver-sies about treatments (Kent, 2003) or medicine (Andsager and Smiley, 1998). Those contex-tual developments cannot be derived from this content analysis, although an increase inspeaking time for patient groups or representatives of activists was not found in this study.A number of other news factors, however, have developed in a way that diverges from thepersonification of laypeople: for instance, less attention is devoted to everyday medical prob-lems, and after 1988 the television stories of laypeople were increasingly characterized bychange, emotions and conflicts. This indicates that a journalistic regime was also present inthe lay period, which constructs a narrative of personified laypeople, told in terms of newsfactors: dynamics, valence, unambiguity and emotion.This feature of media content in the lay period illustrates what we might call the paradoxof the layification of medical television: the lives of laypeople are not actually at issue, nor istheir everyday knowledge and context, which—in the journalistic factuality regime—are ofimportance only as long as they are compatible with the news factors. This also results inexperts playing a supporting role in the journalistic tale as tools and symbols of the medicalscience world.The study shows the historical development of the content of medical televisionprograms in the direction of infotainment (Brants, 1998) and entertainment. References toscience have not completely disappeared, but they are more implicit and symbolical. Thistrend could be the result of the introduction of commercial television in the Netherlands, whichbegan in 1989. The Dutch public broadcasting organizations may have anticipated this byVerhoeven: Mediazation of medicine 471changing the content of the programs more in the direction of infotainment and entertainment.This anticipation of the rise of commercial television corresponds theoretically with the his-torical development of television journalism, described as a process towards increasing use ofmedia logic (Wijfjes, 2002; Altheide and Snow, 1979).Medical journalism on television in 2000 paints a personified and instrumentalized pic-ture of the scientificized society, without problematizing or explaining science explicitly. Thescientification aspects and construction processes of medical science are increasinglyexpressed only implicitly or ignored.The observed development of medical television towards infotainment and entertainmentshows a picture of a taken for granted, almost consumerist use of medical experts, medicalscientists and medical scientific knowledge. Such a one-dimensional media image of scienceand health care as an instrument does not do justice to the complex interrelation of scienceand society. Finally, in terms of social effects the question can be raised about the effect thatthis way of presenting medicine and health care on television has had and still has on thepublic. This is a question for further research.Notes1 The seven non-fiction medical series were: Ziek zijn, Beter worden (1961–5), Medische Kroniek (1968–9),Spreekuur (1969–70), Op uw gezondheid (1971–4), Dokter ja, Dokter nee (1975), Artsenij (1976–81), and Vingeraan de Pols (1981–2000).2 CUDOS is short for communality, universality, disinterestedness and organized skepticism.3 The time series in Figures 1, 2 and 3 were done using a T4253H smoothing filter in order to enable trends to berecognized and for reasons of presentation. The smoothing technique levels off fluctuations but leaves the originaltime series trend unchanged.4 The first period is now 1961–80.5 Verbal reference to science is an index of four variables referring to science rules: communality, universality, refer-ence to scientific research and reference to former knowledge, ranging from 0 (no reference) to 4 (high reference).References<ref>Adatto, K.
