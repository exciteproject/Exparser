Witte & Imke HeitkampAbstractTwo questionnaire studies try to answer the question if different social roles leadto different decisions and justifications concerning ethical problems. In study Iparticipants were asked to decide either on an economic or a medical problem whilegoing into a related social role, in study II role expectations were asked for. Thedecision had to be justified by weighing the importance of four classical ethicalpositions: hedonism, intuitionism, utilitarianism, and deontology. The results showthat decisions and their justifications are dependent on social roles and partly on thecontext. The effect which is interpreted as stemming from social standardization isgreater for role behavior. The differences between role behavior and expectationindicate a misunderstanding crucial for group decisions.Keywords: social role, social standardization, ethics, justificationIntroductionEthical questions are demanding answers more urgent than ever. Recently, theSchiavo case agitated people all over the world and split them up into advocates andopponents of euthanasia. Not only medical questions and questions due to everadvancing biotechnological feasibilities (Mitcham, 1990) keep the world busy but alsoproblems of politics and society, environment and business: How can the war on Iraqbe ethically justified? How should war prisoners be treated? Should the Kyotoconvention on climate change be ratified? Is it right to begin a trade war on textileswith China? It is not surprising that commissions deliberating ethical problems aremore and more common and increasing in number. Although they decide, or at leastgive recommendations, about live and death, peace and war, just and unjust, next tonothing is known about their way of working and factors influencing their decisions. Alook back into history shows that groups in general are vulnerable to mistakes. Andwrong decisions can have serious consequences (Janis, 1972; Tuchman, 1984).When forming a commission, members representing special professions, fields ofexpertise or ideologies are selected. The gathering of people who keep differentsocial roles is a common attempt to try to handle ethical uncertainty and to gainrational argumentation. The question is whether such a procedure is an adequateone or if it rather strengthens social standardization carried over by the social rolescommission members keep. What if people do not feel free to decide individually butwill orientate themselves on social norms? Do people assume potential norms or dosuch norms really exist? What would standardizations mean for decisions and theirethical justifications? The general question is: How could decisions be ethicallyjustified at all? Normally, decisions are explained giving intellectual reasons (Janis,1972). Ethical justifications, however, are relatively rare and so far not in the focus ofactive research, with one exception: the research on justice (Tyler, Boeckmann,Smith & Huo, 1997).The above mentioned questions are to be answered with two questionnairestudies that try to determine the influence of social roles on decisions und theirjustification concerning different ethical problems. Two different perspectives aretaken up: an internal and an external one. The first study focuses on role simulations.Participants were asked to go into a defined social role and to act correspondingly.The second study puts the questions which way of acting people expect fromkeepers of different social roles.1Before describing the survey, theoretical basics to the factors involved into thestudy are displayed: ethics commissions, social roles, and ethical positions.Ethics commissionsEthics committees and commissions are multidisciplinary composed ethicaladvisory bodies in the form of small groups; they work in a defined institutionalcontext and should meet a special advisory need; they especially reflect the morallyproblematic part of issues and problems. Ethics commissions can be characterizedconcerning several factors with different specifications: political level or institutional dependence: from panels of individual hospitals up tonational commissions (e.g. President´s Council on Bioethics, 2001) composition of their members: representatives of different sciences, sometimesof political parties topics: often problems concerning medical practice or bio-/gene technology application: e.g. advice, recommendation, information, control of norms, and type of statement: consensus, votes for several voices, or neutral optioncatalogues.Ethics commissions have various faces. Albeit the committees´ variety andincreasing number (McGee, Spanogle, Caplan & Asch, 2001), the knowledge aboutthem tends towards zero. The group processes within, their way of working, and thequality of their results are more or less a “black box” (Witte, 1991).From a social psychological point of view, the work of ethics commissions is acomplex group task (Witte, 2002a; Witte & Heitkamp, 2005). To the basic elementsof groups – and therefore of ethics commissions as well – belong group members(Arrow, McGrath & Berdahl, 2000). Their composition can influence many aspects ofgroup life, including group structure, dynamics, and performance (Moreland, Levine& Wingert, 1996).Social rolesHere, the studies performed focus on another salient and influencingcharacteristic of commissions´ members: the social role. The social role is a wellestablished category of every-day life with stereotyped images like doctor, priest, orhousewife (Goffman, 1961) which are dimensions of the social identity (Deaux, Reid,Mizrahi & Ethier, 1995). Tacit ground rules form social identities and make everyday2life possible (Chriss, 1999). While there seems to be a tendency towards aconsensus about the contents of roles (Coser, 1991; Turner, 1972), the definitions of“role” diverge. On the one hand, social role is defined as “the typical response ofindividuals in a particular position” (Goffman, 1961, p. 93), a definition whichconcentrates on behavior. On the other hand, there are definitions which focus onthe expectation towards role keepers (Woodland, 1968). Role is the “expectationheld by the group for how members in particular positions ought to behave” (Kenrick,Neuberg & Cialdini, 2005, p. 400). Because each definition alone forms a stereotype(Turner & Colomy, 1993), the synthesis of both seems to be adequate: the role is thepoint of intersection between the behavior orientations of actors, the expectations ofothers and the functional requirements of the society (Sarbin & Scheibe, 1983).Close to social roles are social norms. Compare the above mentioned definitionof role by Kenrick, Neuberg and Cialdini (2005) with their definition of social norm: “Arule or expectation for appropriate social behavior” (p. 4). Each role seems to bedefined through social norms which thus have an impact on the behavior of rolekeepers.Normally a social role is identified as an entity (Turner, 1972). In contrast to that,Turner and Colomy (1993) propose a role differentiation. They sketch threeprinciples: functionality, representation, and tenability, which are highly interactive intheir effects. Thereby, role conflict resulting from ethical situations is significantlygreater than that of any other source (e.g. job, family) (Chonko & Burnett, 1983).Every differentiating principle can be detected in the context of an ethicscommission. Functionality seems to be the main principle for the composition of thecommitteés members. Different competencies and dispositions are associated withdifferent professions or offices. In contrast to Turner and Colomy, conflicts ofinterests are thereby not avoided but wanted. An example is the committee on localwater management that comprises representatives of the water works, politicians,and residents of the affected area (McDaniels, Gregory & Fields, 1999).Another differentiating principle is representation. It is able to cover functionality(Turner and Colomy, 1993). A current example is the decision of the GermanNational Ethics Council on cloning for reproduction or for biomedical research. Fieldsof expertise or offices of the commission´s members ceased to play a role; they weresuperseded by three divergent positions which had emerged during discussion. Inthe end, it only mattered how many members opted for (i.e. represented) which3option (see German National Ethics Council, 2004). As the members of the GermanNational Ethics Council were not able to form a consensus, the importance of thethird differentiating principle comes into consideration. This means, if a consensushad been achieved, some of the members would have given up their roles. Thisobviously too costly alternative must have been against the third principle: tenability.In sum, social roles can be detected and their influence can be esteemed as tobe highly probable. But if and how they work is fully open. The differentiationbetween functionality and representation of roles (e.g. profession and decision of acommittee member) appears to be noteworthy. It has to be shown how far socialroles are functional as schemes and models for personal behavior (Athay & Darley,1982). Because social roles are associated with duties, norms, and expectations(Donahue, Robins, Roberts & John, 1993), the influence of social roles is especiallycrucial in the area of ethical decisions and their justification: Is everyone able todecide freely and rationally or can roles lead to standardized decisions andjudgments which do not mirror the real situation?Definitions of social role stress role behavior, role expectations, or both. It is notclear to what extent role expectations and role behavior go together. It is likely thatthere are differences between role behavior and role expectation because of thedifferences of cognition and conation.Ethical positionsEthical research can be compared to a medal with two sides: one side refers toethics theory, which means to thousands of years of philosophy (Mac Intyre, 1976),the other one refers to empirical psychology. Both sides can be conjoined in one ofour research question that is if theoretical ethical positions of practical philosophycan be found empirically. The psychological perspective should be value-free.1 Incontrast to philosophy, psychology is not interested in ascertain the however basedsuperiority of one position. Psychology is only in the given facts of empiricism. Thequestion behind is not how people should justify their actions but rather how they doit in practice and what factors influence their justifications. For example theconnection between identity, moral cognition (e.g. justification) and behavior (e.g.decision) is of interest (Aquino & Reed, 2002).1 An exception is Kohlberg (e.g. Colby & Kohlberg, 1987) who put different ethical positions inhierarchical order.4Normative ethical positions which are empirically stated are hedonism,intuitionism, utilitarianism, and deontology, (Witte, 2001, 2002b, 2002c; Witte & Doll,1995). The meanings of these value attitudes have also been similarly found(Barnett, Bass, Brown & Hebert, 1998; Forsyth, 1980, 1992; Forsyth & Nye, 1990;Forsyth & Pope, 1984). Hedonism goes back to Aristippos and contains that anaction has to be performed when it brings pleasure to oneself. This could beintermingled with egoism but it does not have to be. To put it more neutral, the actionperformed should not be in opposition to the individual human dignity (Witte & Doll,1995). Intuitionism considers the reason for an action to stem from individual insightor individual feeling regarding it as self-evident. Intuitionism prevents justificationsfrom running to a dead end, to an endless regress (Rawls, 1971; Witte & Doll,1995).Utilitarianism prescribes to perform that action which brings the greatesthappiness for the greatest number (of feeling beings). It is associated with the namesof J. Bentham and J. S. Mill. In contrast to utilitarianism, from a deontological point ofview the end does not justify the means, but the means themselves underlie theneed of justification. According to deontology, justifications should match universalprinciples such as the categorical imperative (see I. Kant). Empirically, people assignvarious degrees of importance to all four ethical positions (Witte, 2002b, 2002c). Thefour ethical positions can be included in a taxonomy, which takes two dimensionsinto account: content matter and the level of the judgment (table 1).Table 1. Taxonomy of the four ethical positions (Witte & Doll, 1995)Content matterLevel of judgmentPersonalGeneralEnd/ConsequenceMean/RuleHedonism Intuitionism(I am concerned with my (I am sure that this actionpersonal well-being.) is appropriate.)Utilitarianism Deontology(In my opinion, one has to (In my opinion, generalconsider the principles serve asconsequences of an action guidelines for our actions.)for everyone.)5It is essential that “different ethical judgments do not imply different ethicalframeworks and similar ethical judgments do not imply similar ethical frameworks“(Hunt & Vitell, 1986, p. 14). In line with this statement ethical positions have beenfound empirically in different contexts. The importance of different value attitudesvaries with culture (Maeng, 1995), with the quality of the actions that have to bejustified (individual, interpersonal, social actions) (Witte & Doll, 1995), with socialidentity (Gollenia, 1999), and with professional socialization (Hackel, 1995).2The variation with profession is especially important for our study, which puts itsstress on different social roles or professions members of (ethics) commissions have,respectively. Gollenia (1999) asked people of three different professionalbackgrounds, economic, medical, and, juridical, how they justify the germlinetherapy. She found that economists prefer hedonistic positions, but that physiciansand jurists favor utilitarian and deontological positions. Many studies empiricallyfound connections between ethical decisions, actions, and ethical positions in aneconomic context (e.g. Akaah & Riordan, 1989; Barnett et al., 1998; Tansey, Brown,Hyman & Dawson, 1994). It is proved that economists prefer utilitarianism when itcomes down to economic decisions (Fritzsche & Becker, 1984; Premeaux & Mondy,1993).It is likely that these results can be transferred to the contexts of (ethics)commissions: members of distinct fields of expertise or professions should come todissimilar decisions and emphasize varying ethical positions as being important fortheir decision. On the one hand, this would strengthen the claim for gathering peopleof various backgrounds because only in this way optimal results could be attained ina commission. On the other hand, a new question arises: If people actually decideand justify according to their social roles, would this mean that the decisions made by(ethics) commissions are not only predictable but also suggestible? Thus, thedecision depends on the role keepers represented in the committee and might bemanipulated by the organizer.Research question and hypothesesThe studies try to answer the question, if there is a connection between the socialrole someone holds and the decision and its justification concerning an ethical2 The quoted literature is written in German. We do not know about comparable literature published inEnglish. If we are mistaken we will be thankful for information.6problem. Thereby it is of special interest whether decisions and their justifications aresocially standardized.Two studies are to shed light on the influence of social roles from two differentperspectives which are known from the definitions of social role: behavior andexpectation. Study I tries to determine this connection whilst participants had to gointo a social role (role behavior). Study II tries to explore this connection whilstparticipants had to think of the behavior of a typical role holder (role expectation). Asecond question of investigation refers to the match between actual behavior ofsomeone holding a special social role and the expectations against him.The following general hypotheses are to be tested:H1: Social standardizations influence ethical decisions and their justifications bymeans of context (medical, economic), thereby weighing the four ethicalpositions differently.H2: Social standardizations influence ethical decisions and their justifications bymeans of social roles and these standardizations can be made explicit by thedifferent weighing of the four ethical positions.H3: There are differences concerning ethical decisions and their justificationsbetween the conditions role behavior and role expectation measured throughthe importance ratings of the four ethical positions.Additionally, it is a finding of its own value to know the different forms ofjustification depending on context, role behavior, and role expectation.Research and analysis designThe hypotheses were tested in two research contexts because values anddecisions are dependent on the situation (for a review of different models see Jones,1991; Kurtines, 1984; Stead, Worrel & Stead, 1990, for an economic background).Thus, it is possible to compare possible role effects and the emphasis on ethicalpositions in both contexts. An ethical problem of a medical and one of an economiccontext were provided, since ethical problems of these two fields are fervidlydiscussed (for example in the media). The medical problem is: “Should genes bemanipulated to prevent hereditary diseases from breaking out?” The economic oneis: “Should the production be transferred abroad and thus jobs being cut in order tosave the company as a whole?” Each participant had to decide on either the medicalor the economic question while going into a related social role (study I) or while7expressing expectations for the behavior of someone holding a special social role(study II). Each participant is linked to one social role, so that both studies follow a 2x 6-design. The social roles are: member of an ethics commission, someone affectedby the decision, social scientist, jurist, politician, and health professional in themedical context. They are member of the board of management, member of thesupervisory board, labor union representative, employee of administration, externalconsultant, and politician in the economic context. These 12 roles comprise a broadspectrum of positions and opinions, but at large, they were chosen at random. Partly,they include contrarian advocacy groups. There are no parallels between the medicaland the economic roles.Each participant had to fill out a questionnaire containinga) a general decision on the main question,b) 20 questions on the justification of the decision using ethical positions, andc) personal data.The 20-questions-part comprises four to six statements to every ethical positionwhose importance had to be marked with a cross on a five-point-scale (from 1 = notimportant to 5 = very important). Examples of items are “I am concerned for mypersonal well-being.” for hedonism, “I am sure that this is the right behavior.” forintuitionism, “In my opinion, one has to consider the consequences for everyone.” forutilitarianism, and “In my opinion, general values are decisive for behavior.” fordeontology.There is empirical evidence of the quality of the questionnaire which has beentested repeatedly (Gollenia, 1999; Hackel, 1995; Maeng, 1995; Witte & Doll, 1995).Our scope of interest comprised three different levels of analysis.

On the average the age was 27.4 years. The youngest subject was 17of age, the oldest one was 81. 21.7% of the subjects mentioned a university grade astheir highest educational achievement. 66.7%mentioned a university-entrancediploma. It is not possible to determine the proportion of students. The subjects wereassigned randomly to the roles.Study II551 subjects took part: 275 females and 256 males. 20 persons did not mentiontheir gender. On the average the age was 30.5 years. The youngest subject was 15of age, the oldest one was 70. 24.8% of the subjects mentioned a university grade astheir highest educational achievement. 54.2%mentioned a university-entrancediploma. 49.1% of the participants were students. 74 participants filled out an online-9questionnaire, which was exactly like the paper-and-pencil version. The subjectswere assigned randomly to the role expectations.ResultsBecause study I and II were similar apart from their perspectives and to be ableto compare their results directly, their findings are described one straight after theother.Results concerning ethical positionsIn study I, a factor analysis of the 20 items could educe the four ethical positions.47.5% of the variance could be explained. Hedonism cleared up 14.0% of thevariance (eigenvalue = 3.24), intuitionism 10.5% (eigenvalue = 1.38), utilitarianism11.0% (eigenvalue = 1.48), and deontology cleared up 11.9% (eigenvalue = 2.92)after varimax rotation.In study II, a factor analysis of the 20 items could educe the four ethical positions,too. Totally, 60.3% of the variance could be explained. Hedonism cleared up 15.4%of the variance (eigenvalue = 4.98), intuitionism 10.2% (eigenvalue = 3.28),utilitarianism 12.8% (eigenvalue = 1.60), and deontology cleared up 13.9%(eigenvalue = 1.17) after varimax rotation.In study I, final scale reliabilities (Cronbach´s alphas) for hedonism, intuitionism,utilitarianism, and deontology were .63, .60, .61, and .65, respectively. To reach analpha of .60, the item “One cannot justify every decision.” had to be eliminated of theintuitionism scale.In study II, final scale reliabilities (Cronbach´s alphas) for hedonism, intuitionism,utilitarianism, and deontology were .79, .60, .75, and .73, respectively.There is empirical evidence of the four ethical positions derived from practicalphilosophy. The results suggest that the subjects accounted on all four ethicalpositions in both studies. These results go in line with the findings of other studiesand proof to be stable.Results concerning ethical positions and the research contextOne has tested whether there are differences in the weighing of the ethicalpositions between the medical and the economic context. To proof the meandifferences analyses of variance were used. First, the mean differences of ethical10positions for each context and within each scale were examined. We used arepeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with context as betweensubjectfactors and the four ethical scales (hedonism, intuitionism, utilitarianism, anddeontology) as innersubject factors. The dependent variable is the weighing ofimportance of the ethical positions related to the decision made. The results of therepeated-measures ANOVA in study I indicated significant effects for the ethicsscales (F = 318.03, p < .00) (table 3). About 32% of the variance could be explainedby the ethics scales. The interaction between ethical positions and context could beneglected because it explained less than 1% of the variance (F = 2.63, p = < .05).The results suggest that despite different contexts comparable patterns ofjustifications have been applied. In our culture there is a clear differentiation whichethical positions are important for justification, also independent from the context andthe roles. (Which ethical positions are more or less important see below, table 2.)The results of the repeated-measures ANOVA in study II indicated significanteffects for the ethics scales (F = 72.34, p < .00) (table 3). About 12% of the variancecould be explained by the ethics scales. The interaction between ethical positionsand context explained about 8% of the variance (F = 44.52, p = < .00). The resultssuggest that somehow similar patterns of justifications have been applied which arein parts independent of the context. But the influence of the context on this patterncould not be neglected. The role expectation is less standardized than the rolebehavior.Secondly, we examined separately for each context to what extent variancecould be explained by roles. We used a repeated-measures ANOVA with roles asbetweensubject factors and the four ethical scales as innersubject factors. Theresults of the repeated-measures ANOVA in the medical context in study I indicatedsignificant effects for the ethics scales (F = 181.57, p < .00) (table 5). 37% of thevariance could be explained by the ethics scales. The interaction between ethicalpositions and roles could be neglected because it explained less than 1% of thevariance (F = 1.78, p = < .05). The results suggest that despite different rolescomparable patterns of justifications have been applied.

The findings suggest that ethical positions weresignificant for a differentiation between the justifications of diverse role keeperswhereas the effect was greater in the medical than in the economic context.Subject of the next section was if there are differences in the weighing of theethical positions between the conditions “role behavior” (study I) and “roleexpectation” (study II) within each research context. In the medical context in study I,more variance of the factor “ethical position” could be explained than in study II (37%vs. 28%), but in study II, the interaction between ethical position and contextaccounted for an at least median amount of the variance (8%). The comparisonbetween the conditions “role behavior” (study I) and “role expectations” leads to theconclusion that for role behavior the independence of the context of the justificationsapplied is greater than for role expectations. This also means that patterns of ethicalpositions for the justification of onés own behavior seem to be more rigid than theexpected pattern which to a greater part allows options.In study I and II the justifications of diverse role keepers could be differentiatedby different ethical positions. The effect was greater for the condition of roleexpectations (study II): more social roles and more ethical positions contributed tothe overall influence of roles than for the condition of role behavior (study I).In the economic context in study I, more variance of the factor “ethical position”could be explained than in study II (27% vs. 5%), but in study II, the interactionbetween ethical position and context accounted for an at least median amount of thevariance (8%). The comparison between the conditions “role behavior” (study I) and“role expectations” leads to the conclusion that for role behavior the independence ofthe social role is greater than for role expectations. This also means that patterns ofethical positions for the justification of onés own behavior seem to be more rigidthan the expected pattern which to a greater part takes the scope of roles intoaccount.17Table 9.

In study I, the interaction could be stated as a median effect (10% ofvariance explained), in study II as a minor effect (3% of variance explained).Taken together there are differences in the weighing of the ethical positionsbetween the conditions “role behavior” (study I) and “role expectation” (study II)within each research context.Results concerning the connection of decision, justification, and roleQuestion of the next step was if there is a connection between decision,justification, and role within a context. So we used multiple correlations with decisionas dependent variable and the four ethics scales and the roles as independentvariables. We wanted to determine to what extent the individual decisions within acontext could be predicted by the individual importance weights of the ethicalpositions. Significant multiple correlations indicate individual freedom to choose andjustify the decision between roles and in roles. If instead social norms dictate adecision the variance will be small and thus lead to an insignificant correlation.Table 10 shows the results of a multiple correlation for the medical and theeconomic context, respectively, in study I. Hedonism and deontology could explainthe individual decisions in the medical context, utilitarianism and deontology couldexplain the individual decisions in the economic context. These ethical positionscould contribute significantly to the prediction of the individual decision. In themedical context the individual decision depends on the amount of weighing theindividual ends and the common means. The other two predictors are sociallystandardized without explanation of the individual choices. In the economic contextonly general means and ends could predict the individual choices. In contrast to that,the role did not contribute independently to the prediction in both contexts. The19interpretation is interindividually standardized, as expected from the theoreticalposition and the definition of a role. Evidently, only the non-individual part of the roleinterpretation was important as can be gathered from the interaction of role andethics. The effect for the medical context (ε² = 0.11) as well as the effect for theeconomic context (ε² = 0.15) can be interpreted as median effects, whereas Cohen(1977) determines a median effect as ε² = 0.15.Table 10 shows the results of a multiple correlation for the medical and theeconomic context, respectively, in study II. Intuitionism, utilitarianism, and deontologycould explain the individual decisions in the medical context, utilitarianism anddeontology could explain the individual decisions in the economic context. Theseethical positions could contribute significantly to the prediction of the decision. Thecommon means and ends are weighted from an individual point of view in bothcontexts. The individual interpretation of the role did also contribute independently tothe prediction in both contexts. Evidently, the individual part of the role interpretationwas important in the part of role behavior expectation. The effect for the medicalcontext (ε² = 0.11 and 0.24) as well as the effect for the economic context (ε² = 0.16and 0.59) can be interpreted as medium effects with ε² = 0.15 and ε² = 0.35 as largereference values.Table 10.

By the means of the pattern of justification the decision could bepredicted in both contexts.In study I, the individual interpretation of the social role did not contribute to theprediction of the decision. The subjects are able to form a consistent interpretation ofthe role behavior in both contexts. This was possible for the standardized part of therole, which means that the behavior was prescribed by social norms that areconnected with a social role. In study II, the social role contributed to the prediction of20the decision. Standardization could not be stated. The individual interpretation of thesocial role was responsible for its influence on the decision.It was tested whether there are differences in the connections between decision,justification, and role between the conditions “role behavior” (study I) and “roleexpectation” (study II) within each research context. The above mentioneddifferences between the findings of study I and II lead to acceptance.Results concerning the connection between decision and justificationIt was to be tested if there is a connection between decision and justification. Itwas proofed on an interindividual level whether the decisions could be predicted bythe means of the justifications within the roles. For both contexts separately multiplecorrelations with the decision as dependent and the four ethics scales asindependent variables were used. Study I: Table 11 shows that intuitionism whichhad been able to differentiate between roles on the basis of mean differences couldneither contribute significantly to the prediction of the decision in the medical context,nor when considering all roles together. That leads to the conclusion that individuallydifferent interpretations of a role did not contribute to the prediction of the decision.This applied to utilitarianism, too. Only hedonism and deontology were able to predictthe decision of politicians (ε² = 0.22) and members of an ethics commission who areaffected by the decision (ε² = 0.43). Both roles had a negative beta-weight forhedonism (which means affirmation in this case) and a positive one for deontology(which means denial). This finding suggests that people who act as politicians or asmembers affected by the decision and interpret their role individually, would ratheraccept gene manipulation if they preferred hedonic positions and refuseddeontological positions. These roles tolerated individual decisions in contrast to theother roles. Their decisions and justifications were standardized to a much greaterextent. Further predictions were not possible.Study II, medical context: Table 11 shows that intuitionism which had been ableto differentiate between roles on the basis of mean differences could neithercontribute significantly to the prediction of the decision (exception: jurist), nor whenconsidering all roles together. That leads to the conclusion that individually differentinterpretations of a role did not contribute to the prediction of the decision. Thisapplied to hedonism, too. Just utilitarianism and deontology were able to predict thedecisions when all roles were taken together. In detail, utilitarianism was able to21predict the decisions of social scientists and jurists. Deontology was able to predictthe decisions of ethics commission members who are affected by its decision andjurists. To predict decisions within single roles deontology seemed to be mostsuitable. The decisions of members of ethics commissions, members affected by thedecision, and jurists could be predicted. The three roles had a positive beta-coefficient for deontology which means in this case that they would rather reject genemanipulation if they preferred deontological positions. For jurists it is the same withintuitionism. Social scientists had a negative beta-coefficient for utilitarianism. Theywould rather accept gene manipulation the more they stress the importance ofutilitarian arguments. The four rolesmentioned possess individual scopes ofdecision. The expected decisions and ratings were not as much determined as theywere for the other roles. For the residual roles reliable predictions were not possible.Table 11.

This finding suggests that people whoact as external consultants or as employee of administration and interpret their roleindividually, would rather deny the production transfer abroad if they preferreddeontological positions. These roles tolerated individual decisions in contrast to theother roles. Their decisions and justifications were standardized to a much greaterextent.In study II in the economic context, intuitionism which had not been able todifferentiate between roles on the basis of mean differences could contributesignificantly to the prediction of the decision when considering all roles together(table 12).Utilitarianism, and deontology contributed significantly to the prediction ofthe decision, too, which supports the results of the multiple correlation concerning thedifferentiation between roles. On the level of single roles deontology was able topredict the decisions of members of the board of management and employees ofadministration. Both roles had a positive beta-weight for deontology (which meansdenial). This finding suggests that people who act as members of the board ofmanagement or as employee of administration and interpret their role individually,would rather deny the production transfer abroad if they preferred deontologicalpositions. These roles tolerated individual decisions in contrast to the other roleswhose decisions and justifications were standardized to a much greater extent.The decision could be predicted by the interindividually different justification ofthe decision. But the finding is narrowed referring to single roles and ethicalpositions. The decision could be predicted for two of six roles each in the medicalcontext and in the economic context. Taking together all roles in the medical context,this applied to hedonic and deontological positions and to a deontological position inthe economic context. The interindividual differences in these ethical positionsinfluence the decision within specific roles. In study II the scope of the results islimited again: the decision could be predicted for four of six roles in the medicalcontext and two of six roles in the economic context. Taking together all roles, in themedical context this applied to utilitarian and deontological and this applied tointuitionism, utilitarianism, and deontology in the economic context.23The above mentioned findings give evidence that there are differences in theconnections between decision and justification between the conditions “rolebehavior” (study I) and “role expectation” (study II) within a role.Table 12.

Table 13 shows the frequency distributions as to the decisionin the medical context in study I. The decision for or against gene manipulation wasat a ratio of about 2.5:1 at large. Most people voted for the manipulation of genes toprevent heredity diseases from breaking out. A chi-square-test was used todetermine whether there is a connection between decision and role but it did notbecome significant (Chi² = 1.31; p > .05). There must be a social standardization ofdecisions beyond the moderation of roles.Table 13 shows the frequency distributions as to the decision in the medicalcontext in study II. The decision for or against gene manipulation was at a ratio ofabout 1:1 at large. We used a chi-square-test to determine whether there is a24connection between decision and role. It became significant (Chi² = 20.19; p < .00).That means that the decision is dependent on the role expectation.Table 13.

Table 14 shows the frequency distributions. The decision against jobtransfer was at a ratio of about 3:1 at large. Three-fourths of the people voted againstthe production transfer abroad. The labor union representative is an exception:almost all of them deny a production transfer abroad (94.1%). This time the chi-square-test we used to determine whether there is a connection between decisionand role became significant (Chi² = 12.89; p < .05).In study II, the economic context provided similar results as under the medicalcontext for role expectation, an e<ref></ref>he decision for or against job transfer was at a ratio ofabout 1:1 at large. The labor union representative is an exception: almost all of themdeny a production transfer abroad (95.7%). The chi-square-test we used todetermine whether there is a connection between decision and role becamesignificant (Chi² = 54.10; p < .00). That means that the decision is dependent on therole in the economic context.25Table 14.

Only in study I in the medicalcontext, the frequency distribution was independent of it. This exception suggeststhat all roles have the same standardization to accept gene therapy (which isoutlawed in Germany). Whilst this seems to be the case for role behavior, theexpectations against role keepers does not seem to be that strict.Subject of the next paragraph was whether the frequency distributions of thedecisions made is dependent on the role and differs between the conditions “rolebehavior” (study I) and “role expectation” (study II). To test this, a chi-square-test wascalculated. Table 15 shows a comparison of frequencies of denial and acceptancebetween study I and II. For each context or role a single chi-square-test wascalculated. Observed frequencies refer to study II. Anticipated frequencies arecalculated on their basis and are the frequencies which would be anticipated if theresults of study I had been exactly replicated. This procedure was necessary toadjust the different numbers of subjects and frequencies between study I and II. Dataand results have been written in a row in each case to save space. Frequenciesdiffered significantly between study I and II in the medical context (chi² = 21.37; p <.00) and in the economic context (chi² = 122.39; p < .00). On the level of roles, only26two comparisons did not become significant (member of the ethics commission whois affected by the decision in the medical context and labor union representative intheeconomic context). For these roles, similar standardizations seemtobeexpressed in role expectations and behaviors. For the two contexts in general andthe other roles, expectations and behavior differed and suggest misunderstandings incommittees if the role is known and a specific decision expected.Table 15.

Observed frequencies refer to study II; anticipated frequencies are calculated on their basis andare the frequencies which would be anticipated if the results of study I had been exactly replicated.DiscussionThe first results of both studies refer to the ethical positions questionnaire whichhas once again proved to be a reliable and efficient instrument for the survey ofethical positions.Thescaleshavea suitable internal consistenceandthe27fundamental positions of practical philosophy - hedonism, intuitionism, utilitarianism,and deontology - could be confirmed via factor analysis.Study I and II give evidence for the importance of all four ethical positions when itcomes to justifying a decision. The positions could be stated for a medical and aneconomic context and seem plausible to be detectable on other contexts, too.As regards content the studies try to answer the question if there is a connectionbetween the social role someone is holding and the decision and its justificationconcerning an ethical problem. Thereby it was of special interest whether decisionsand their justifications are socially standardized. The results of the studies gave thefollowing answers: The justifications were in parts independent from the context (medical undeconomic). Different roles showed similar patterns of justification mostlyindependent of the context. The ethical differences were greater for role behaviorthan role expectation. The direction of the decisions was dependent on thecontext. Each context forwarded socially standardized decisions which were toagree to gene manipulation and to deny production transfer. Socialstandardizations were more influential for role behavior. Different social roles led to different justifications which meant socialstandardization through roles. The effects were irregular concerning differentroles and different ethical positions. More differentiations and thus lessstandardization could be stated for the economic context in the condition roleexpectation. Social roles influenced the direction of the decisions which could be interpretedas influence of social norms. An exception was role behavior in the medicalcontext: the influence of the context was more powerful and overlaid the one ofsocial roles. Differences between role behavior and role expectation could be stated. Theyheaded for the direction of greater influence of social norms in role behavior.The findings have an important impact on the composition and treatment ofgroups discussing an ethical problem, especially ethics commissions. In general, it ishelpful to include the role when differences in the justifications are considered. Thisalso means that it is possible to guide discussions better if the importance of ethicalpositions for the justification of a role keeper is known. It may also be promising tolead group members to take a perspective contrary to their own (Rutherford, 2004)28because group discussions can lead to a polarization as well as to stereotypes(Brauer, Judd & Jacqueline, 2001). Especially disagreements increase stereotyping(Kunda & Spencer, 2003) and can thus lead to “rigid fronts” during discussions. Rolekeepers should be able to express the self and connect with group members(Bettencourt & Sheldon, 2001; Davis, Conklin, Smith & Luce, 1996) without havingmisguided perceptions about parties to a negotiation or conflict (Ames, 2004). Ifdifferent justifications can actually be found and ethical positions are variouslyweighted, respectively, then it must be assured that not only all important positionsare represented (Scanlon, 1999; Schönecker, 2005) but equally considered duringthe ethical discussion. In this way, the influence of the composition of members couldbe decreased and the quality of the group´s performance and the finding of aconsensual result could become easier. Last but not least the equal consideration ofdifferent ethical positions meets the demands of our value pluralistic society.As to the decisions: In the condition “role behavior” (study I), the chosen contextsretain socially determined decisions, independently from the roles. A great majorityvotes for gene manipulation and against the transferring of jobs. Thereby, the ethicaljustifications clearly differ in their importance. Individual perspectives and opinionscan only accomplish with special roles and problems when deciding on an ethicalproblem. From a rational point of view the connections between decision,justification, and social role should not be fixed but should be extinguished. Thiscould be done best by a process of discussing an ethical problem based on reason.In the condition “role expectation” the decisions are less standardized. Thedifferences between role behavior and expectation give evidence for amisunderstanding between the two perspectives. People behave in a way they meanto meet the expectations linked to their roles but actually they do not meet them.Again, the uncertainty concerning the “proper behavior” and the “right decision”should be solved by the means of a discussion process which puts a stress on open-mindedness, rationality, and balanced argumentation.Further research is necessary as to the standardization of role behavior anddecisions. To speak with Turner and Colomy (1993) the functional, representational,and tenable part of social roles should be determined in its influence. Not only furtherevidence for the mechanisms of role standardizations is needed but also thedevelopment of group procedures which are able to prevent the influence ofstandardizations. In addition to questionnaire studies, field studies and experiments29are desirable. Last but not least, further research should take into account differentcontexts because the fields in which ethical problems are discussed are evergrowing. This research is only a very first step into a research about prescriptiveattribution (Witte, 2001).ReferencesAkaah, I. P., & Riordan, E. A. (1989).
