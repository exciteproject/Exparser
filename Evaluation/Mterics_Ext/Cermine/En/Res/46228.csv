SchwarzIntergenerational transmission of trajectoriesof suffering in precarious environmentsResearching the younger generations’ strategies ofreinterpretationAbstract:This article discusses some pivotal questions regarding processes of the intergenerationaltransmission of trajectories of suffering in precarious places: to what extent can such pro-cesses provide resources that foster agency, and to what extent do they rather constitutebarriers to living one’s own life? How much do intergenerational relations allow for cer-tain reinterpretations while discouraging or inhibiting others? Which reinterpretations ofthe older generations’ experiences appear legitimate in certain contexts, and which arerebuked by one’s social environment?In order to pursue these questions we present analyses of two very different cases thatare based on two forms of data material – the life story of Emma, a woman in her 50s,and ethno-analytic group interviews with adolescents aged 14 to 20. Both cases are em-bedded in very different regional and political contexts: the former, in the French systemof fostering institutions, and the latter a Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank.Both constitute, however, cases of intergenerational transmission of trajectories of suffer-ing. One objective of this article is to illustrate how the contrasting of such cases acrossdifferent kinds of data and contexts can be heuristically useful for methodologically gaug-ing the spectrum of the ubiquitous and sometimes paradoxical phenomena of intergenera-tional transmission, in order to further develop its conceptualization.Key words: intergenerational transmission, precarious environments, narratives, gener-ations, fostering, refugee camp.1 IntroductionIntergenerational transmission is a ubiquitous phenomenon that has been dis-cussed across disciplines such as psychoanalysis, sociology, psychology, history,and education. It comes into play when we debate questions of the very reproduc-tion of society, the relationship between structure and agency therein, collectivememory, the reproduction of social status and power relations, of historical andfamily narratives, of cultural practices etc. The objects or contents of these pro-ZQF 15. Jg., Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 57‒7758ZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 57‒77cesses can be manifold, and of a very different nature or essence. According toDaniel Bertaux and Isabelle Bertaux-Wiame (1988, pp.8‒9), there is not just onesort of transmission, but many, and of very different objects or contents, i.e. “ofbehavior and attitude models, values and bans, linguistic resources, perceptive,cognitive, scholastic, communicational, affective, economic and legacy resources.”Daniel Bertaux and Paul Thompson – a sociologist and a historian in reference tothe psychoanalyst Pierre Legendre – assert a universality of the desire for trans-mission in intergenerational relationships. Moreover, they emphasize that for theparticipants it is not so much the particular content, but the mere fact that some-thing is passed on and “that transmission to children in itself constitutes a rela-tionship transcending the limitations of human mortality,” (Bertaux/Thompson1993, pp. 6–7). The latter emphasis on action versus content seems of particularimportance for research on intergenerational transmission in precarious environ-ments, where parents are economically not well off and socially excluded. In thesame vein, Catherine Delcroix, in her study on intergenerational transmission ina marginalized neighborhood in Toulouse, asserts:[It] is the act of transmission itself that is important over and above the content. In fami-lies with few or no resources, where there is no objective ‘capital’ to transmit, there arestill the nontangible assets of moral values and love which, together with the family his-tory, can give meaning to the current situation (…). Communicating family history cantherefore enrich the minds of young people, whilst at the same time giving them an iden-tity which is other than that associated with their rejection by schools, the labour marketand by the way in which society in general shapes its discourse on ethnic minority youths.(Delcroix 1999, p. 187)Delcroix emphasizes that, in many cases, the only resource parents in such pre-carious social environments can rely on “is of a subjective nature, composed ofphysical, psychological and moral energy together with their knowledge of socialrelations and sociability (…) which they have accumulated throughout the lifecourse” (Delcroix 1999, p. 175). This, however, leads to the question of what hap-pens with difficult, even traumatizing elements, which often characterize precari-ous family histories and life courses. Can they indeed be considered a resource onwhich youths can draw – or do they constitute an object that cannot be conveyedwithout overburdening the children? Is it at all useful for parents to relate life sto-ries that reflect a trajectory of suffering (Schütze/Riemann 1991), a phase in lifewhere they were not able to come to terms with the social reality that was inflict-ed upon them? But on the other hand, is it at all possible to not pass them on?We discussed these questions during our participation in a French-Germanseminar on socialization, gender and migration between professors, researchers,and PhD candidates. This led us also to reflect on the concept of transmission andhow it could help us understand the diverse phenomena we encountered duringour fieldwork.In the following text we refer to a dynamic notion of intergenerational trans-mission and not just a vertical or one-way relationship. According to Bernard La-hire, who studied the configurations that allow the transmission of parents’ cul-tural capital in working class families particularly in relation with school, we haveto keep in mind that transmission depends on many exterior factors (Lahire, 1995,p. 274). In the two cases presented herein, this requires us to question any notionof transmission that neglects “the work, the appropriation and construction doneby the ‘apprentice’ or the ‘heir’” (Lahire 1995, p. 277). To describe this process,S. Chaieb, C. H. Schwarz: Intergenerational transmission of trajectories59Inowlocki coined the term generational work in her research with families of for-mer Jewish displaced persons, in which the middle and younger generation active-ly produced continuity by “trying to know and understand about oneself and oneanother through each other” (Inowlocki 2013, pp. 30, 41). She develops this con-cept in her analysis of scenes of personal interaction between family members, buteven if this should not be possible anymore, the younger generations can still car-ry out generational work by reflecting and reinterpreting interactions with theolder generations. We postulate with Déchaux, that there is an “elective link tothe line” (Déchaux 2007, p. 92) that attributes an active role to the “heirs” in thereinterpretation of the content of what has been transmitted. But if it seems per-tinent to question the notion of transmission in precarious environments, can wetalk about what Attias-Donfut and Wolff (2009, p. 28) call “le désenchaînementdes générations,” a generational rupture or disconnection with which the childrenof migrants are confronted, meaning they are “facing a destiny they have to con-struct all by themselves”?The following analysis of two case studies (in part II.) will reveal some unex-pected dynamics regarding the questions outlined above. We present two cases ofintergenerational transmission of trajectories of suffering – or trauma1 – in whatcan be called precarious environments, albeit in very different contexts: theFrench system of fostering institutions and a refugee camp in the West Bank. Inboth cases, the previous generation had migrated before our interviewees wereborn; but in the first case, the migration of the older generation is contextualizedby French migration policies and the country’s economic need for labor power,while in the case situated in Palestine, the older generation fled out of fear of po-litical violence or was in fact expelled. We are aware that both cases differ in morethan in this aspect: the data material consists in the first case of an individual bi-ographical interview, in the second case of consecutive group interviews. More-over, the interviewees are of a very different age at the time of the interview: inthe first case it is a woman of 58 years who by now is a mother herself; in the sec-ond case they are young people aged 14 to 21.Given that our cases differ in a variety of aspects, our idea is not to compareour two cases in the strict sense, but rather to discuss them in their similaritiesand differences regarding processes of intergenerational transmission. This pointof view allows us to understand the “how” rather than the “why” (Becker 1998)and to gain an understanding of the processes that are in the background of ourtwo cases of intergenerational transmission in a precarious environment.Furthermore, discussing these two cases side by side was at first merely helpfulfor finding out more about each respective individual case. But we soon realizedthat both cases have more in common than one would suspect at first sight by as-sessing their external criteria.In the ensuing discussion (3) we will reflect upon the common structural dy-namics and differences of both cases. However, we are aware that this discussionis testing the limits of casing and comparing. Therefore, in the conclusion (4) wewill reflect upon the results but also upon more general questions of “comparabil-ity” and casing, and the pitfalls and opportunities that comparisons of such differ-ent cases imply.602 Case studiesZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 57‒77On the premise that “[...] a case becomes the opportunity to discover knowledgeabout how it is both specific to and representative of a larger phenomenon” (Wie-viorka 1992, p. 170), we here present two case studies in which we found some in-teresting elements concerning the process of transmission. The first case study(2.1.) results from Sarra Chaïeb’s research project on the experiences of membersof minority groups in foster institutions in France, and the second case (2.2.) fromChristoph H. Schwarz’s (2014) research on adolescence in a Palestinian refugeecamp. In order to better understand the cases, we will at first contextualize bothand outline the general research question and methodology.2.1 Case Study 1: Growing up in French child welfare.By interviewing adults who were fostered during their childhood and adolescence,Sarra Chaïeb’s research tries to understand how members of ethnic or religiousminority groups experienced their placement in two child protection organizationsthat are historically characterized by religion (Judaism and Catholicism). On theone hand, she asks how the two care institutions impact people’s life courses andtheir sense of belonging, in regard to the socialization in their families. On theother hand, based on interviews with professionals, she explores how individualsand also groups of individuals – groups of migrants, for example – influence orhave influenced the evolution of the boundaries and the professional practices ofthese organizations. The interview with Emma2 was one of those conducted in theexploratory phase of this research, and is one which exposes the main topics thatalso emerged throughout the subsequent interviews: the sense of belonging, theconstruction of socialization between the institution and the family and the con-tradictions this can cause, and the place of religion and ethnicity, among others.3The importance of this question is underlined by the growing concern regardingthe evaluation of public policies, which tries to understand which resources canhelp fostered children and which constraints can burden them (Delcroix 2005).Despite the existing research on this question presenting a wide array of method-ologies and samples, and even though it involves various disciplines and fields, asmall number of recurrent issues crop up time and again (Frechon/Dumaret 2008;Chaïeb 2013): success at school, professional insertion, physical and mental health,and housing, as well as the impact of gender on placement trajectories (Bauer etal. 1993; Dumaret/Coppel-Batsch 1995; Frechon 2003; 2009; Dumaret, et al. 2009;Potin 2009, 2012; Stein/Dumaret 2011).Compared to other countries (Thoburn/Chand/Procter 2005)4, the specific ques-tion of the fostered children’s cultural or religious background has only brieflybeen broached by French research (Gheorghiu 2002). We try to understand theway in which people see their placement trajectory after they have left care, to seehow they have structured themselves in this context, in which resources they havefound support (Castel, 1995), but also what type of socialization they have devel-oped between their family and the institution in which they have been placed. In-terpretations are thus based on their related memory. Using life stories seems tobe the most appropriate way to understand these types of data. For Daniel Ber-S. Chaieb, C. H. Schwarz: Intergenerational transmission of trajectories61taux (2005, p. 36), “there is life story when a subject tells to another person, a re-searcher or not, any episode from his lived experience,” which allows us not to“impose a standardized interview” onto people, and to give them “the time andplace to tell their own story,” (Burawoy 2003, p. 436). Formerly fostered personsenter in what D. Bertraux (2005, p. 21) calls “categories de situation“ because it isthe situation itself that is common; they all passed a certain phase of their lifecourse being fostered.Concerning the institutional situation, it seems obvious that the family, after acertain period of fostering, does not play the role of most important agent of social-ization and intergenerational transmission anymore. Instead, the fostering insti-tution appears to take the parents’ place in the everyday life of the children andyouths. This idea leads to more questions: in the context of fostering, is there asort of institutional intergenerational transmission, too? Does the transmissionnecessarily come from the family? What about the “plural kinship” (Cadoret 1995)in the framework of foster care? In our case, and referring to the conceptual con-siderations above, one might ask, which are the contents of intergenerationaltransmission that are appropriated by Emma? What would parents transmit totheir children in a context of fostering? What is the link between transmission andre-appropriation in this case? These dimensions can be considered regarding theconflict and/or the idea of “plural socialization” (Lahire 1998) that foster childrenare more likely to face. The case presented in the following, Emma’s life story, isan example of such a life course.2.1.1 Emma: Elements of her life courseEmma is a 58-year-old woman. She is married and lives with her husband in theirhouse near Paris. They have three children who are between 20 and 30 years old.She has been a nurse since the age of 27.Emma was fostered again and again during her youth, often during short peri-ods when her mother gave birth to Emma’s brothers and sisters. Emma is the eld-est of a family of eleven children, and was born in Tunisia when the country wasstill a French protectorate. Her mother is Kabyle Algerian. Her father, a Tunisian,fought for France during the Second World War, in which he was wounded. He ar-rived in France around 1955, when the country recruited immigrants as cheapworkers. He was housed, among other immigrant workers, in southern Frenchshanty towns, before he moved to the first public housing built for migrant work-ers. Emma and her mother, who had stayed in Tunisia until that time, rejoinedhim in France after 3 years. He subjected Emma to abuse and physical violence.Her mother did not intervene, as a result of which Emma felt betrayed by her. Thesuccessive pregnancies of her mother led to Emma’s frequent fostering, and by theage of 10, she had already been fostered for 2 to 4 years in a children’s house, be-cause of poor housing and malnutrition at home, and to prevent tuberculosis.From the age of 10 to 14 years, Emma lived in a placement institution. At theage of 15 she returned home, where she was again subjected to extreme violenceby her father to the point where he tried to kill her. He also battered her brothers.But now, as an adolescent, she decided to press charges against him. In the trial,her father was sentenced to 30 years in prison, whereas she was transferred toanother foster place, this time a religious institution. There, she was subjected tosexual abuse by a priest. Furthermore, she was always rejected by other childrenand continuously insulted as a “dirty Arab.” To escape from this situation, she de-62ZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 57‒77cided to run away from the foster institution just before she turned 21; she also at-tempted suicide, but survived. Her later meeting with a social worker allowed herto find a job. Later on she returned to school and graduated in nursing in 1980.2.1.2 The transmission viewed as a constraint during fosteringIn Emma’s case, the difficulty concerning intergenerational transmission seems tobe situated on two main levels: firstly, her story raises the question whether, in-side her family, a family memory was actually developed and passed on. Secondly,which elements could be reinterpreted to keep a trace, an inheritance in this cha-otic life course?For a long time, Emma was ashamed of her family and of where she came from.At the beginning, all the suffering that her parents subjected her to did not allowher to refer to her family in any positive way. For Emma, everything seemed to benegative and destructive.Emma: And after all these questions, there is everything that goes into pieces, and youask yourself “Why all this?” You don’t want to be a victim, you say to yourself,“I’m sick of all that, I have to assume,” but you’re always ashamed, it’s verystrong. I was sometimes making up a story, not to say where I come from. I wastempted to believe that my father was a big man in the army, that my motherwas the daughter of a tribal chief, you know, just for fun, to think that they werenice people… After that, I told myself that it wasn’t the point, anyway I wouldnever be like that.Here Emma expresses the shame she felt, and explains the temptation of trying tofend off this shame. This period seems to be difficult for her; she does not want tobe in the line of her parents’ descent. But even though the negligence, mistreat-ment and violence she experienced from her parents reappear in Emma’s memory,she later on developed something in common with them, some specific memorieswhich are mentioned in her talks. A part of what has been passed on to her washard to accept for a while: her face, first name and surname are visible traces ofwhat she represents for people. We can see in this interview extract that Emmahad experiences of racist discrimination at different moments in her life course.The differentiated treatment (Cossée/Lada/Rigoni 2004; Chaïeb/Cossée 2013) shewas confronted with – to be considered just as Arab while she just wanted to be“as the other,” – can partially explain the reason why Emma has so much difficul-ty to accept herself as Arab.Emma: […] it’s true, I always loved my job, it was all I could do to prove to humanitythat I could do something good, because during all this time, even during the in-ternships, people considered me a dirty Arab. In so far that I sometimes treatmyself as a dirty Arab too although I never recognized myself as Arab. Quickly Ichanged my first name, when they asked where I come from. I couldn’t say that Iwas Tunisian, because for me it was the reflection of my father and my mother[…] But it’s true that I was thinking that maybe on my deathbed I will find thecourage to take my maiden name again and use it with pride.Thus, Emma sent a strong signal by changing her name and gaining some dis-tance from her family history. After that, she explains the joy she felt when shetook her husband’s name, which made her life easier, in particular when she waslooking for a job. She felt protected from people’s opinions but also from what shedisclosed about herself. Emma did not recognize herself in other people’s regardand could not consider herself as a part of her parents’ cultural origin.S. Chaieb, C. H. Schwarz: Intergenerational transmission of trajectories63The question of her parents’ origin seems to be one of the most important andstrong issues for Emma because it is central to her identity construction and herrelation to others. It is impossible to override this set of problems, precisely forthese two reasons. But how could one feel engaged in a positive intergenerationalrelation with one’s parents, their values, traditions and general cultural frame,when these elements are distorted by a violent climate of mistreatment? Emma’sspeech reflects this ambivalence very well: on the one hand, the paradox consistsin dismissing the elements that could lead to her origins, because she does notidentify with them. On the other hand, she describes a possible “return to origins”– in this case reverting to her real first name – as an act of bravery.2.1.3 The re-interpretation of fostering as a strategy to link with familytransmissionIn Emma’s case, there seem to be two main aspects which come into play whenshe reinterprets what has been passed on: time and the necessity to draft her ownlife and her concept of self. Emma needed time to take a different look at how shesuffered, and building her own family was significant for the reinterpretation ofher life course. Studies on fostering often deal with the dimension of time: themore time has passed after leaving the care institution, the more people can takea global view on their fostering and develop resilience (Frechon/Dumaret 2008, p.8; Stein 2006, p. 7).Time is indeed an important factor in the interpretation of events that punctu-ated her life, and Emma succeeds in describing her life course from a positivepoint of view despite what she went through. For a long time, Emma felt resent-ment against her mother. Later, however, she speaks about the mother-daughterrelationship as not very developed, but as playing an important role in her lifecourse and the tenacity she found in herself:Emma: I arrived after a tragedy, it was hard, but I hope… I think that she loved me. Idon’t know if she wanted me but nevertheless she took me in her arms. I thinkthat someone who copes, who isn’t mentally ill, who doesn’t commit suicide,maybe such a person was, for the two or three first years of her life, touched,kissed, liked… for me, if you had that, you can come to terms with all uproar, youwill always be better off than someone who didn’t have that.Here Emma manages to point out the positive elements that her parents passedon to her, or at least she can see something positive in these elements. Accordingto her interpretation, the fact that she has been able to cope despite all the hard-ship counts as proof that the past cannot have been all bad, that at least in herearly childhood her mother must have loved her and have cared for her. All theseelements form part of the construction of family memory, even though the frame-work in which they evolve does not coincide with the norms of a “normal family.”Time is fundamental for a possible construction, deconstruction and reconstruc-tion of a family memory that is passed on, and it is “beyond the individual [that]fits in the movements of continuity and movements of rupture of families’ story, infamilies’ links, in forms of transmission and in the content of inheritance.” Thereis also a necessary work for each of us, beginning from what was passed on, to ar-rive at “be yourself.” The family memory, according to A. Muxel (2007, p. 10), hasthree functions: “a transmission function, in the continuity of a family story, andattached to perpetuate the particularisms” (2007, p. 13); “a regeneration [revivis-64ZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 57‒77cence] function which allows to stage memories of childhood time and family life”(2007, p. 23); “a reflexivity function: it consists in learning about family experi-ence, have a distant view over the past, the circumstances and persons who madeyou, do a temporary making-up of oneself destiny” (2007, p. 30).In Emma’s life course, the transmission and reflexivity functions go together,because she is in perpetual questioning of past events. It took a long time to ac-cept what she experienced, the difficulties she went through, and the destructiverelationship between her parents and herself. When she speaks about her broth-ers and sisters, she considers that they have not yet managed to take the plungein the comprehension of this family story. For her, there are two steps of recon-struction: the search for a guilty person and the attempt to understand the rea-sons for what happened. The dimension of social supports and/or of people whoplay the role of resource in the life course is very important in Emma’s trajectoryas a fostered person (Goyette 2006; Frechon/Goyette 2013). When she was young,Emma met adults who became significant others, such as her school teacher whotook on an almost maternal relation towards her. The fact that Emma speaksabout her teacher in a vocabulary of love, as the love she did not have from hermother, might indicate that this relation compensated for some of the lack of af-fection on her mother’s part.Emma desperately seeks information about her parents and their life course.Paradoxically, it is the very lack of information that increasingly becomes a re-source for her. After all these years of hatred towards her mother, today Emmabelieves that her current objective may be to avenge her mother as a woman. Ac-cording to Emma, her mother never had a chance in life: she did not have thechoice to marry or to control her body. Emma defines her life course as a struggleagainst injustice, especially against men, and feels involved in a mission:Emma: […] I am on trial. I had problems with all the men I met in my life… and then Iput them on trial, so this means there is something wrong. I’m in a woman’s re-volt against men. As if by chance, from my father, to the educators, clergy, em-ployers, it’s always men, so maybe I rebel against that, or maybe it is the rebel-lion of my mother that she couldn’t realize so I’m stuck with all that.Emma here tackles her female rebellion as the result of a mother-to-daughtertransmission, even though this might not have been her mother’s conscious inten-tion. She actively (re)constructs what her mother experienced as a woman, appro-priating these experiences herself, applying them to her biographical process, andstriving for continuity. Emma explains everything about her life story, her moth-er’s difficulty to be a subject of her own life, not just because she did not have in-tellectual resources, but because she did not have any access to the informationthat would have been useful in a precarious social and cultural context. Hence,she theorizes and attributes the basis of this rebellion to her mother. Emma, bycontrast, succeeds in being independent. Even if she speaks a lot about her bad re-lationships with men in general, we can note that she found such a balance withher husband, with whom she feels independent; she seems to have escaped from acertain pattern of relationships. Another important departure from her mother’sstory is her job, which in Emma’s narration is depicted as a particularly importantresource for her independence and emancipation.Emma: My real freedom, it was when I succeed to graduate at 27; before this moment, Iwas still under the yoke of authority … the authority of the man from whom Irent my room, and the employer.[…] I keep all my work experience records, be-S. Chaieb, C. H. Schwarz: Intergenerational transmission of trajectories65cause it’s really my pride to get recognition. Wherever I was, I did not have anyvalue for people, an Arab, a thief, a violent person, so I showed off my abilities,because before they were buried. The more I succeeded, the more I found someself-esteem.This case illustrates the concept of transmission and allows us to think of this no-tion as a dynamic one. As a case of an “extreme situation” of transmission (Ber-taux 1997), it can challenge the notion and point to some new dimensions. We cansee that Emma finds a dimension of transmission from her mother in her lifecourse in spite of how her mother acted towards her. Taking an active part in re-interpretation seems to be very important in the case of transmission in this pre-carious environment.2.2 Case Study 2: Growing up in a Palestinian refugee campThis second case study is based on Christoph H. Schwarz’ (2014) research on thestructure of potential spaces of adolescence (King 2002) in Palestinian refugeecamps in the West Bank. In the West Bank there are 19 of these camps, and an-other 40 Palestinian refugee camps are scattered throughout Gaza, Jordan, Syriaand Lebanon. The socioeconomic and political situations in these camps differfrom one another, depending on each camp’s relation with the respective politicalregime and the juridical status it has granted the refugees. But despite the localdifferences all of these camps seem to provide particularly illustrative cases of theintergenerational transmission of a refugee identity and the concomitant politicalnarrative.The first generation of the inhabitants of the refugee camps shares a predomi-nantly peasant background. Originally, the camps were established under theauspices of international humanitarian organizations in 1948 in order to giveshelter to the approximately 750 000 refugees that fled or were expelled duringthe course of the first Arab-Israeli war, which in Jewish-Israeli discourse is calledthe War of Independence, whereas in the Arabic discourse it is referred to by theterm Nakba (catastrophe in Arabic) (Sayigh 1979, pp. 6ff.; Bowker 2003, pp. 67ff.).However, using the term “camp” already seems misleading here, as it is usuallyassociated with tents. Today, these camps can better be described as “concrete-structured slum neighborhoods on the peripheries of cities” (Morris 2004, p. 1),which in many cases are difficult to distinguish from the neighboring cities asthey merge with their fringes. Nevertheless, three generations after the Nakba,the perpetual reference of the term “camp” is accurate insofar as it reflects the po-litical and social paradox that the camp is still defined as a transitory space, andthat expressions of the collective intention to “return” are omnipresent in muralsand statements. In contradiction to this, however, there is the everyday individualneed to come to terms with the current situation and the attempts to improve it,which finds its expression in the construction of three- or four-story apartmenthouses in the camps. This paradox also characterizes the United Nations Reliefand Works Agency (UNRWA), which can be considered an international institu-tional framework for passing on the refugee identity and the respective collectivememory: UNRWA’s definition of “Palestinian refugees” includes the children andgrandchildren of those who had to flee in 1948, so that, due to the demographicdevelopment, the more time passes since the Nakba the more persons are defined66ZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 57‒77as Palestinian refugees. By now, the agency counts approximately 5 million Pales-tinian refugees (Schiff 1995; Bowker 2003; Schwarz 2012b).5Some authors claim that the refugees’ “livelihoods have stabilized after threegenerations and their basic living conditions resemble those of the host countrypopulations” (Hanssen-Bauer/Blome Jacobsen 2007, p. 29). However, the livingconditions in these densely populated areas are difficult, showing unemploymentrates above the respective national average, albeit a higher-than-average qualityof education provided in UNRWA schools; they constitute precarious environ-ments with limited perspectives for inhabitants and for future generations. Asother refugee camps worldwide, they have been in the center of armed confronta-tions again and again.62.2.1 The affirmation of intergenerational continuityThe data material presented here is the result of ethno-analytic group interviews7conducted from 2008 to 2011 in one of the refugee camps in the West Bank, most-ly with members of a youth folklore and theatre group. In their shows theseyouths combine political theatre with dabka, an ubiquitous Arab folk dance in theLevant. The cultural center where they practice – called Markaz8 here – providesseveral community services and is at the same time a meeting point for interna-tional visitors who want to get an impression of the situation of Palestinian refu-gees – for example by taking guided tours through the camp – or who are engag-ing in projects of Palestine solidarity networks.The participants in the first group interview were four boys and seven girlsaged 15 to 19 years, together with their trainer, 20-year-old Adnan. In the begin-ning the youths were asked to talk about the history of their group, and how theygot to know each other. The first one to answer was one of the girls, Yasmeen (15),who introduced the group as the “fifth generation” of the Markaz Dabka Troupe.With this explicit reference to the term “generation” she directly located the groupnot only in the cultural center but also in a particular intergenerational relation-ship. It turned out later that the youths are being trained by the “fourth genera-tion” of the group (of around 20 years of age, like Adnan) and they themselves actas trainers of the “sixth generation,” that is, children of approximately 8‒12 yearsof age. By this, they reproduce the transmission of the refugee identity and themilitant struggle for “return” among the three generations of refugees, which oneof the boys, 16-year-old Maher, described later in this interview:Maher: And you know here, the revo-, the revolution, the struggle, it’s moved from gen-eration to generation. Yeah. (...) Yeah, the big man is give like his gun or his-, histhing to his child. And his child will do the same, you know? Like for me, my fa-ther told me that there is a revo-, revolution and don’t forget Palestine and youhave to struggle, you have to do something, and the situation here is... you haveto do something. Because we live in a... a camp, we have friends in the prison, wehave friends who’s died, yeah. And ‒, and this thing do that ‒, that you have to ...to struggle, yeah.Looking at structure and content of this passage from a perspective of FritzSchütze’s (1977, 1983) text sort differentiation9, Maher reports what his father toldhim about the ongoing “revolution,” he does not contextualize this conversation ina particular situation. No particular place or point in time is mentioned, the in-teraction is less described as a relevant one-time experience than as everydayS. Chaieb, C. H. Schwarz: Intergenerational transmission of trajectories67practice; this, in turn, can be interpreted as an indicator of the ubiquity of thenarrative in the camp. Moreover, Maher does not mention his own reaction to hisfather’s demand, it does not appear as a vocal interaction but as a message that isreceived and accepted, giving the impression of a vertical, one-way direction oftransmission. Accordingly, he presents an argumentation: “you have to struggle,you have to do something” because of the fact that they live in a camp, that“friends,” supposedly of his own generation, died or were serving prison sentences– both presumably because of confrontations with the Israeli security forces. How-ever, although the concrete means of “struggle” to which the group refers are notoutlined so far, the demand to struggle here was described as an almost “natural”or logical result of the situation. Still, the argumentative form seems to indicate acertain social pressure to engage in the struggle, a pressure that is not onlypassed on by the older generation but also exerted within peer relationships.This argumentative mode also characterized the following course of the inter-view, when Maher and Adnan took turns in presenting long statements, talkingabout the general situation at the checkpoints, the imprisonment of minors etc.Sometimes these statements also referred to their own practice as a dabka group,which the interviewer was able to attend later. In these shows, the youths com-bine folkloric dance and music with theatre playing, but the actors would not ar-ticulate any monologues or dialogues, or sing songs themselves, which might havegiven the performance or the enacted character a more individual or personaltouch. Instead, the narration that went along with the show came from a recordedCD, just like the music, and the actors would dance and perform to it. The youthsenacted the Nakba and the ongoing political and militant struggle against Israel.Moreover, they enacted the transmission of the mission to “return” from the olderto the younger generation: in the respective scene, one of the actors would die as amartyr on stage and in his last words – again, from the CD, with underlying mu-sic – would confer to his son the mission to never give up the land and to fight forit, stating that it was the most precious and meaningful asset on earth – a missionthe son willingly accepted and re-enacted, with the other actors rising, joining in,everybody raising their fists.But in spite of this militant presentation the youths affirmed already in thisfirst interview that “throwing stones” had not had the desired political effect, buthad only put the youth at risk. In the same vein, Adnan had at one point dis-tanced himself explicitly from suicide bombing – “I’m not with them!” he reiterat-ed twice10 – and declared that their mission as a youth group was to carry on thestruggle “in a new way,” by informing about the situation of the Palestinian refu-gees on an international level; and like this, he added, “the kids” would also “seeother countries.” In the following he went back to the issue of the tours Yasmeenhad mentioned in the beginning of the interview, and put them in a much morepolitical context:Adnan: For the new generation everything is, that means11, is changed. In the past youdidn’t have just one solution, just to fight. Now, I can ‒, by dabka troupe, I canchange, I can by, uh, our education I can change, I can change by a lot of ways.Like for me and for them, we enter Markaz [CHS: Hmhm.], we enter the dabkatroupe and I remember the-, the president of... ah, not the president, the presi-dent of ‒, ah... (…) For biiig ‒, for big center [presumably another cultural center,CHS], they told-, they told us (clears his throat), I mean, you are 16, aaah, 16kids, you visited Canada just for three weeks and really, really, you change, youchange... like the govern ‒, the Palestinian government in twenty years. (...) This68ZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 57‒77is the good thing. Not just to fight, not just to ‒, to ‒, told the people “We needthat, and we need that and we need that.” I changed how the people, they thinkabout us, there. This is the good thing, good. I mean, if the revo ‒, if the revolu-tion happen again ... maybe I accept and I agree with them. But I must tell themthere is a lot of ways.Maher, in the passage cited earlier, referred to the term “generation” in order tostress the continuity in the process of intergenerational transmission of the strug-gle, whereas Adnan very clearly highlights the differences between generationswhen he states that for the new generation, “everything is changed”. He contrasts“the past”, when one could only fight, to the current situation and to his activitiesas a trainer for the dabka troupe. Moreover, he relates an encounter in which, asit seems, a president of another cultural center praises and compliments thegroup for its achievements through their cultural activity and their contributionto the national struggle. However, what starts as a situation of praise and com-pliment in Adnan’s narration soon turns into an act of argumentative justifica-tion: When the revolution “happens again,” Adnan has to decide if he “accepts andagrees with them” (without further explanation who he refers to as “them”). Hisacceptance on principle granted, he argues that “there is a lot of ways,” which hehas described before as theatre playing and education. He thereby declares his es-sential identification with “the revolution” but at the same time the possibility –and the individual right – to choose how to support the struggle. Whereas Adnandescribes the past shortly as a trajectory of suffering – characterized by a loss ofcontrol that leaves no option but “to fight” – the present seems to give more lee-way for strategic reflection. Accordingly, one can assume that dabka serves indeedas another form of resistance in the asymmetric conflict with Israel, in the senseof claiming a cultural presence and continuity and advocating for the political pro-ject of “return.” On a psychological level, it might help the youths to deal with po-litical violence they experienced directly (although none of that is mentionedhere); moreover, it might serve as a means to deal with trajectory experiences ofdisplacement that were passed on by the older generation. However, it becomesmore and more obvious that their dabka practice also serves to broker intergener-ational and inter-factional power relations within their own community, as the fol-lowing paragraph will illustrate in more detail.2.2.2 Adolescent strategies of re-interpretationIn the course of the subsequent interviews, which were conducted without Adnan,and mostly gender-separated, the youths were willing to talk about more personalquestions, such as love or familial relations (Schwarz 2012a). Whereas in the firstinterview the camp community was presented as a family-like community show-ing solidarity to all of its members, in these subsequent interviews, boys as well asgirls soon complained about the sexual repression and social control in the camp,stating that everybody would gossip and ruin the respective girl’s reputation, andthat parents would react with severe punishment. They namely blamed the moreconservative or religious factions in the camp as responsible for this situation, anddescribed the dabka group and the cultural center as potential spaces in a hostileenvironment, and as the most important places where boys and girls could meetwithout being controlled (there are, by the way, hardly any co-educative schools inPalestine, and the UNRWA schools are no exception). All the youths expressedtheir hope that their own children might grow up without such social control, inS. Chaieb, C. H. Schwarz: Intergenerational transmission of trajectories69more “liberal” circumstances. They often referred to the situation of youths in the“Western” countries (Northern America, Europe) as a model. This, in turn, shedsnew light on their symbolic militancy – because it is precisely their role as politi-cal representatives that allows them to travel as a gender-mixed adolescent group(only looked after by members of the third or fourth “generation” of the group) andin fact to create a temporary space beyond the crowded confinements of the campwithout the social control of their parents or the conservative factions of the campcommunity. Taking into account that travels in general are a very adolescent mo-tive, their trips to foreign countries and the contact with foreign cultures and lifeprojects of other adolescents represent an important “potential space of adoles-cence” (King 2002), because it allows them a certain reflective distance from whichto view the circumstances and moral values of their community, and Palestiniansociety in general.In one of the later interviews, the girls also referred to what their grandparentshad told them about the Nakba. They stressed that their grandparents had keptthe keys to their houses to this day. Departing from this topic, they continued todiscuss their own hopes for “return” in a much more skeptical way than as pre-sented in their shows, or in the first interview:Aziza/Jamila: Yeah.Jamila:CHS:Aziza:Jamila:CHS:Nadia:Aziza:Jamila:Aziza:And they have the keys ‘til the ‒, (in a low voice) ’til this day.That’s what I was about to ask... do they still have the keys?But there’s no home (smiles) \ [CHS: Alright.] or no-, nothing there!It’s just the keys. (giggles)\ (smiles) It’s destroyed!So talk to me about the keys. What ‒, what do they mean?Hope... That they...they have the keys of their homes, so... [Jamila: ~~~] theythink that they will come back soon. [CHS: Hmhm.] They come back//Maybe not-, not-, eh, not-, ((ours)), how do you say that?Not ours.Not our hope, like.. I mean, the keys.. (clicks her tongue, smiles) I don’t know,because, ehm... (to another girl) go ahead, speak! (smiles) our Engl-, [CHS: Speakin Arabic if you want.] our grand ‒, grand ‒, what? [Jamila: Parents.] Yeah. Theyju ‒, they just have the hope. I don’t have the hope, [CHS: Hmhm.] like them... Ihave but ‒, not like//Nadia:Not the same hope like they do... they have. [Aziza: Yeah.]In this passage, the hope to return is symbolized by the keys their parents orgrandparents still keep – objects of memory that will be passed on to the youngergeneration, just like it is presented in political murals, slogans and songs, whichcampaign for the “right of return.” Here, however, the keys are presented assomething that is not relevant for the girls’ situation as adolescents or for theirlife projects. At some point they even seem to ridicule and laugh about theirgrandparents’ hope, which might indicate that among themselves these hopes arealso a target of a certain aggressiveness towards the older generation. This, inturn, is seen by some authors as characteristic of an adolescent detachment nec-essary to reach autonomy and construct one’s own life project (Blos 1962; Erdheim1982; Bosse 1994). Apparently, there are two very different “hopes for return,” andtheir own project of return, which they so fervently defended in previous inter-70ZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 57‒77views, once more seems to differ a great deal from the old generation’s concepts.But after this passage, the girls discussed in an argumentative manner that theconnection of their grandparents to the villages was stronger because they had ac-tually lived there. 14 year old Nadia – the youngest of the girls – in the end gave aconclusion, which, again, stressed generational differences, but was characterizedby empathy for their grandparents and for their hopes described as futile before:Nadia: They’re old, they can’t just, you know... ~~~ ((leave it behind))Jamila:(giggles)Here it seems like she wants to make the interviewer understand their grandpar-ents’ condition, while Jamila is still giggling. Then again, in a later passage Nadiastated:Nadia: They told us to keep fighting, but there are ways of fighting, you know? Like,ahm, I don’t have to hold a stone and threw it at them to say that I’m fighting.(…) Eh, we can study and learn (…) many things and this is how we... can fight.Or dancing dabka...Statements like this one, which recall Adnan’s argumentation cited above, cameup quite often in the interviews, and were generally supported by the group,which indicates a high relevance for the speakers and a kind of collective strategyin situations of justification. Such argumentations implicitly indicate that the re-alization of each individual life project in one way or another has to refer to thiscollective narrative – otherwise, individuation would be considered betrayal. Inher last statement, Nadia once more emphasizes that the youths refuse to stick to“traditional” ways of fighting, which – last but not least – might endanger theirlives, their health and their freedom to a much greater extent than dancing dab-ka. Nadia does not mention more militant actions here, but her description is rem-iniscent of a general political situation that has long been characterized by theveneration for martyrs or Intifada fighters who are perpetually invoked as heroesand paragons in the Palestinian public. Here, this (self-) destructive kind of“fighting” is contrasted with the youths’ ways of fighting: even before the mention-ing of dabka, which is still a collective cultural practice that is directly linked tothe construction of Palestinian traditions, Nadia refers to studying and learning,activities that can be used for a variety of reasons and for the realization of veryindividual life projects.Taking into account that the whole “first generation” of the dabka troupe hasmigrated, and by now lives and works in foreign countries, one can conclude thatthe group might in some manner implicitly prepare for migration projects; thenarrative of “return” in this case appears as a framework through which intergen-erational (and inter-factional) conflicts are being brokered, and the youths’ adoles-cent strategy in this framework is to appropriate and re-interpret the narrative.They are partly allowed to actually abandon the collective project of “return” ifthey pay tribute to it by actively reproducing and embodying it on a cultural andsymbolic level.12S. Chaieb, C. H. Schwarz: Intergenerational transmission of trajectories713DiscussionThe case studies presented here both offer examples of processes of intergenera-tional transmission of trajectory experiences in precarious places. During theanalysis of the interviews it became clear that precariousness in these cases notonly refers to economic aspects, but also to the fact that the interviewees grew upin places that are defined as anomalous by their societies and by themselves. Be-ing in these places means that “something went wrong.” Therefore, our interview-ees feel more compelled than others to deal with the question of where they comefrom, where they belong, and where they might go, and to retrospectively makesense of their family histories. With respect to the refugee camp and its dire con-ditions of living, one could assume that – in accordance with Delcroix (1999, 2009)– the narrative (or myth) of struggle and return is one of the few resources par-ents can pass on to their children. It allows them to make sense of the current sit-uation and explain this very precariousness, and it might serve to symbolize howmuch more parents would have liked to pass on to their children: houses, homesand opportunities that now lie behind the Israeli border. If their children orgrandchildren overtly turned them down by not accepting the narratives’ concomi-tant mission, it might be devastating for the elders. The aspects of this transmis-sion are two-fold: on the symbolic level it refers to their parents’ identity construc-tions as Palestinian refugees and acknowledges their trajectory experiences of suf-fering; on an institutional level the narrative embodies their claims to UNRWAand to the international community, which provide important services in a precar-ious situation.In the situation of fostered children in France, the question of transmission iscrucial because of the role the institution of care plays, as it replaces the family,and because of the importance of the fostering institution in the life course. InEmma’s case, the family history that she (re-) constructed all by herself, and herfantasies about the relation to her mother in her early childhood years appear asbiographical resources that enable her to make sense of her current situation, andto develop and maintain agency. Institutional violence she had to come to termswith during fostering led her to conceive herself as a fighter, and moreover, in-volved her in a political struggle for gender equality. Furthermore, some of thepeople who offered social support allowed her to (re-) construct herself. At firstsight, the most important entity of intergenerational transmission in this case ap-pears to be the foster institution that replaces the family. However, it was precise-ly by reconstructing her family narrative that Emma was enabled to gain a reflex-ive distance from this institution and to pursue a process of further individuation.Simultaneously, she engages in a process of politicization of her own case, as shedeals with the power relations at the intersection of migration/racism and patriar-chal oppression, and defines them as the central theme of her life story.However, for our discussion, the most important difference between both casesseems to be the level of explicitness and grade of symbolization of transmission.These aspects obviously determine the respective strategies of the intervieweesand the character of their generational work: in Emma’s case, the content of famil-ial transmission appears unclear and has to be reconstructed all by herself,whereas in the case of the dabka group, the transmitted narrative permeates allaspects of life, imposes a very explicit political project onto the younger genera-tion, and functions as a myth, in the sense that it offers ready-made explanations72ZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 57‒77for everyday life. Albeit very different in structure and context, in both cases theprocesses of intergenerational transmission and their respective grade of explicit-ness appear as both resources and obstacles and are pervaded by tensions andcontradictions. Regarding the dabka group, the paradox apparently consists in theyouths re-enacting and paying tribute to the myth, and the more they embody theproject of return onstage, the more they are allowed to individuate and in fact di-verge from both myth and collective project when it comes to their own life pro-jects. In this sense, they use the narrative of return as a symbolic resource – notonly in the struggle against Israel, but also in intergenerational and inter-factional conflict – in order to create and preserve a potential space of adolescence(King 2002). In Emma’s story the lack of a common language, which does not al-low verbal communication with her parents, and therefore at first appears to bean obstacle, is in retrospect used as a biographic resource, offering a certain lee-way for active re-interpretation of the family history, which in turn is used tocome to terms with the traumatizing foster experience. In both cases, re-interpretation is crucial in order to lead one’s own life.4ConclusionTogether with Howard Becker and Charles Ragin (1992) we asked ourselves“What is this a case of?” We claim that these are cases of intergenerational trans-mission in precarious places, extreme cases in the sense that in the first the pro-cess of transmission is highly obscure and in the second it is highly explicit. Therespective younger generation’s strategies of appropriation of the content that waspassed on differ according to this level of symbolization.However, the somewhat abstract notion of “appropriation” and case structureonly developed in the course of our discussion of the cases, and it would be difficultto do this “casing” beforehand, before speaking to the interviewees, or merely re-ferring to exterior data. We at first had the impression that our cases differed agreat deal when it came to a certain “common denominator” that was yet to beidentified and theoretically conceptualized. So, going back even further, to thequestion “What is a case?” we would claim that, categorizing these cases as casesof intergenerational transmission results from the process of research and discus-sion itself, because of the relevance of the issue for our informants. Our inform-ants implicitly outlined their respective strategies of re-interpretation to us andmade use of the interview situation to reflect upon them. Regarding the method-ology for the research on processes of intergenerational transmission, both life sto-ries and ethno-analytic group interviews are examples of very open approaches of“data retrieval,” and it is precisely this openness that might allow intervieweesnot only to convey, but also to reflect on their experiences, which in turn might re-sult in generational work, if they seek to produce continuity. In Emma’s case, itseems that she made use of the research situation as a potential space in order tointerpret or re-interpret experiences that were passed on to her, and to actively re-construct her life story. The intimacy of the life story approach allows Emma toconstructively assert a posture of reflexivity. Life story telling allows looking atthe process in action, and provides the possibility of understanding the “diachron-S. Chaieb, C. H. Schwarz: Intergenerational transmission of trajectories73ic dimension” (Bertaux 2005, p. 13) especially of life courses and how processes ofintergenerational transmission are embedded therein. The case of the Palestinianyouths illustrates the potential of open group interviews in researching how inter-generational transmissions are brokered in adolescent peer groups, and howgroup dynamics interfere with hegemonic discourses and individual as well as col-lective self-concepts. The weight of the violence suffered by former generationsand of the collective myth built in reaction is obvious – however, it becomes alsosalient to what extent the dynamics of peer groups can constitute a resource forindividual development. Here we cannot delve deeper into the development of theresearch relation, but also in this case the group used the consecutive talks in or-der to discuss norms that before seemed to be taken for granted. In this case, a po-litical mission and a transmitted collective narrative resulting from an asymmet-ric military-political conflict are moreover used to broker a latent conflict betweengenerations; apparently, processes of individuation are only possible if the latterconflict maintains its latent character.Albeit very different regarding their data form, context, and age of the inter-viewees, both cases can serve as contrasting cases in order to map the field of in-tergenerational transmission of trajectories of suffering in precarious environ-ments, and the coping strategies the following generations develop therein. A par-ticular strength of explorative and qualitative research is to find “counter-intuitive cases,” cases that do not fit into the scheme we have expected so far.Heuristically, such a contrast of cases, which at first sight do not seem to have alot in common, may help to illustrate the sometimes paradoxical dynamics of in-tergenerational transmission.Notes1 It seems obvious that in the two cases discussed here the experiences passed on by theolder generation were traumatic; in addition to that we assume that our intervieweessuffered traumatic experiences later on in their biography and might continue to do so.However, the aim of this article is not to identify transgenerational traumatization orto clinically distinguish between those experiences passed on by the older generationand those that were actually experienced by the interviewees themselves. We assumethat trauma was passed on, but that predicting results of this transmission wouldmean to ignore precisely the capacity of the younger generation to actively make senseof it. Therefore, our focus lies on the younger generation’s reinterpretations and theiractive role in dealing with what is passed on to them.2 Her name was modified by the author in order to provide anonymity.3 To briefly contextualize the field of French child welfare: according to ONED’s estima-tion, at the end of 2011, the number of minors supported by child welfare was approx-imately 275 000 and the number of young adults between 18 and 21 years old wasabout 21 000. Among all these children concerned by child protection measure, approx-imately 133 000 children are outplaced in foster families of in institution.4 This question appears in the international European context. The UN Convention onthe Rights of the Child (UNCRC) contains articles that relate to religion or ethnic ori-gins (Articles 2‒14‒30).5 This is a central difference between UNRWA’s and UNHCR’s definition of who is to beconsidered a refugee. According to UNHCR’s definition, this status cannot be passedon. UNHCR was founded in 1950, one year after UNRWA, and caters to all other refu-gees worldwide. This difference and a more detailed comparison between UNRWA and74ZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 57‒77UNHCR reveal an important shift of the international community’s strategy to react torefugee crises. According to Benjamin Schiff, “UNRWA is surviving, because the condi-tions for its founding and perpetuation continue, but, as an international organization,it is an evolutionary dead end. It provides assistance vital to the Palestinian refugeesand valuable lessons for other aid agencies, but the United Nations learned from itsUNRWA experience never again to create an organization dedicated indefinitely to thecare of a single refugee group.” (Schiff 1995, p. 270)6 That accounts not only for armed confrontations with Israeli forces in West Bank andGaza, but also for the “War of the Camps” (1985–1987) in the course of the Lebanesecivil war or, currently, the confrontations and the ensuing siege the Syrian army im-posed on the Palestinian Refugee Camp Yarmouk in Damascus.7 The methodology of ethno-analysis/ethno-hermeneutics was developed by Hans Bosse(1979) and combines the perspectives of ethno-psychoanalysis and group analysis. Itfocuses on the research situation, especially the group dynamics and research relation-ship developing therein (Bosse 1979, 1994, 1996, 2007; Schwarz 2010, 2014). However,in order to not complicate the contrast of this case with the first one, the interpreta-tions presented in this article are mainly based on an adapted narrative analysis in-spired by Fritz Schütze (1977, 1983) and Gerhard Riemann (1985, 1986).8 All names of institutions and persons were replaced by pseudonyms, and all local ref-erences altered by the authors in order to guarantee the anonymity of the interview-ees.9 The notion of narratives in this case study is applied in a twofold sense: with referenceto empirical material, i.e. the interviews, we distinguish between narratives, descrip-tions and argumentations of the interviewed subjects in the sense of Fritz Schütze(1977, 1983) and Gerhard Riemann (1986, 1986). That means, an interviewee’s per-sonal, biographical narrative – which can also be the collective narrative of a group ofinterviewees who experienced certain events together – tells personal experiences ofthe subjects. Usually they are told as one-time experiences, that is, they are referred toas located in a particular time and place, relevant for one’s further biographical devel-opment and having the quality of changing one’s own perception of the world. Thissometimes occurred in the group interviews but not in those passages that can bestserve to illustrate the processes of intergenerational transmission, which is why theywere not presented here. In contrast, when we speak for example of national narra-tives or master narratives (Hammack 2011), we don’t speak about personal experienceper se, but how personal experience is framed within the collective narrative withwhich one identifies. We touch upon collective memory on a higher level – that of animagined community (Anderson 1983) instead of the memory of a group that is basedon personal relations.10 This statement was not in reaction to an explicit question by the interviewer but oc-curred in the course of his monologue.11 Phrases or words in Arabic have been translated to English but appear in italic lettersin order to demark the difference.12 Therefore, the dabka group can indeed be seen as a potential space of adolescence(King 2002) that conditionally allows for individuation, in the sense of the reflexive de-velopment of an individual life project through the experimentation with new roles andthe active quest for experiences in new environments.Bibliography<ref>Anderson, B.
