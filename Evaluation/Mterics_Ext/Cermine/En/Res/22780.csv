DouglasKeele UniversityGroup Processes &Intergroup Relations2005 Vol 8(3) 231–244GPIRCriticism is an important aspect of communication within and between groups, but reactions tocriticism of groups have been little studied. Past research has shown that criticism elicits greatersensitivity when made by an outgroup member, compared to an ingroup member. Twoexperiments were conducted to examine how this intergroup sensitivity effect (ISE) is affected bythe context of the criticism. Experiment 1 showed that the ISE occurs in a private context, butdisappears when it is clear that the criticism is made to a large public audience. Experiment 2investigated intragroup criticism and manipulated both audience size and audiencecomposition. Results showed that ingroup criticism elicited greater sensitivity and less favorableevaluations of the speaker when made to an outgroup rather than an ingroup audience. Theresults highlight strategic considerations and tacit protocols governing the criticism of groups.keywords audience, context, criticism, intergroup relations, reactionsC O M M U N I C AT I O N is central to intergrouprelations. Stereotypes are largely reﬁned andpropagated through it (Lyons & Kashima, 2003;Maass, 1999; Maass, Salvi, Acruri, & Semin,1989). Indeed new stereotypes may emergefrom communication (Douglas & Sutton, 2003;Higgins & Rholes, 1978). Aspects of intergrouprelations such as conﬂict, conﬂict resolution,and negotiation are intrinsically communi-cative. In this paper, we explore some of thestrategic considerations surrounding animportant communicative aspect of intergrouprelations: criticism of groups. Extending recentresearch on how this criticism is received, weinvestigate the impact of the communicativecontext in which criticisms are made.Social identity theory (Tajfel, 1978; Tajfel &Turner, 1979) and self-categorization theory(Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, & Wetherell,1987) state that people’s identity partly derivesfrom their membership in social groups.Author’s noteAddress correspondence to Tracey Elder,School of Psychology, Keele University, Keele,Staffordshire, ST5 5BG, UK[email: t.j.elder@keele.ac.uk]Copyright © 2005 SAGE Publications(London, Thousand Oaks, CA and New Delhi)8:3; 231–244; DOI: 10.1177/136843020505394003 Elder (bc-s) 27/6/05 1:47 pm Page 232Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 8(3)Similarly, individuals’ self-esteem derives partlyfrom their success in establishing and main-taining a positive distinction between their owngroup and others’ (Tajfel & Turner, 1986).Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that peoplewill employ a range of strategies to establishand preserve this positive distinction. Thewelfare of groups themselves, and not just theirconstituent members, also depends critically onthe esteem in which they are held (Van Vugt &Hart, 2004).Explicit criticism of the ingroup is a verydirect and potent threat to the image of thegroup. However, until very recently researchershave largely ignored the important issue of howpeople respond to criticisms of their group.Theoretically, a key determinant of how groupcriticism is received ought to be its source:speciﬁcally whether it comes from an ingroupmember (i.e. intragroup criticism) or anoutgroup member (i.e. intergroup criticism).Intragroup criticism, although painful, helpsthe group to identify and rectify its weaknesses,facilitating growth, change, and improvement(see also Nemeth & Owens, 1996). This kind ofcommunication is analogous to intrapsychicprocesses such as considered reflection andself-criticism (Carver & Scheier, 1999; Kurman,2003). Subjecting one’s group to reasonablecriticism therefore may be a valuable means offurthering its interests. In kind, fellow ingroupmembers may be willing to entertain intra-group criticisms, regarding them as probablywell-informed and well-intentioned. On theother hand, criticism from an outgroupmember is more likely to be seen as a maliciousattack, perhaps aimed at bolstering theoutgroup’s relative status, and as such is likelyto arouse hostility (e.g. Bourhis, Giles, Leyens,& Tajfel, 1979; Grant, 1992).There are other grounds to expect thatingroup criticisms will be preferred to outgroupcriticisms. For example, leaders who are moreprototypical of their group find it easier toachieve influence over their fellow groupmembers, as they are seen to have their group’sinterests at heart (Hogg & van Knippenberg,2003). By analogy, ingroup members also tendto be more prototypical of the group than232outgroup members. Also, when evaluatingpersuasive messages (Eagly, Wood, & Chaiken,1978; Wood & Eagly, 1981) and attempts atingratiation (Vonk, 1998, 2002), observers arestrongly affected by what they perceive to be thetarget person’s motives. Indeed these ﬁndingsare consistent with contemporary theories ofcommunication in which the perception ofspeakers’ motives is crucial for successful com-prehension and evaluation of their messages(Albright, Cohen, Malloy, Christ, & Bromgard,2004; Douglas & Sutton, 2004; Higgins, 1981).Hornsey, Oppes, and Svensson (2002) con-ducted the ﬁrst empirical investigation of theseissues. They presented criticisms of ingroups(Australians, students), manipulating thesource to which those criticisms were attributed—speciﬁcally, an ingroup member (i.e. intra-group criticism) or an outgroup member (i.e.intergroup criticism). Hornsey et al. found thatintragroup criticisms were tolerated rather gra-ciously; indeed ingroup speakers were judgedas favorably when they criticized the group aswhen they praised it. However, whereasspeakers who praised the ingroup were ratedequally as favorably whether or not theybelonged to the group, outgroup critics werejudged more harshly than their ingroup equiv-alents. In short, criticisms were welcomed whenmade by ingroup members but met with sensi-tivity and defensiveness when made byoutgroup members. Hornsey et al. (2002)found this intergroup sensitivity effect (ISE)(p. 299) to be mediated by perceptions thatintragroup criticism is better informed andintentioned than intergroup criticism.These ﬁndings were mirrored by those pub-lished more or less simultaneously by O’Dwyer,Berkowitz, and Alfeld-Johnson (2002). Theserevealed greater hostility towards the critic,higher levels of anger, and less agreement withthe criticism when the critic was a member ofthe outgroup rather than an ingroup member.Subsequently Hornsey, Trembath and Gun-thorpe (2004) have shown that criticisms areonly welcomed from ingroup members who arehighly identiﬁed with or committed to theirgroup. This result underscores the importanceof the motives that are perceived to underlie03 Elder (bc-s) 27/6/05 1:47 pm Page 233criticisms. Similarly, Hornsey and Imani (2004)found that outgroup critics were not toleratedeven when they were as knowledgeable aboutthe group as ingroup members, suggesting thatmotives and not experience are strongly pre-dictive of sensitivity.The importance of the context ofcommunicationAlthough internal criticism can be a valuableaspect of group functioning, it carries with itcertain risks. Hornsey et al. (2002) suggest that‘ingroup criticism will be tolerated to the extentthat it is not making the group vulnerable toattack from other groups’ (p. 305). Thissuggests that if ingroup criticism is perceived tomake the group susceptible to outgroup dero-gation, then it could evoke as much sensitivityas outgroup criticism. Such an instance mightoccur when the criticism appears in public to alarge audience. The criticism is then availablenot only to ingroup members, who might makeconstructive use of it, but is also available tomembers of other groups whose impression ofthe ingroup may be adversely affected, and whomay use the comments to their advantage.This distinction between public and privatecommunication has generated considerableresearch in the domain of individuals’ presen-tations of themselves (e.g. Schlenker & Wowra,2003; Sedikides, Herbst, Hardin, & Dardis,2002; Tice, 1992). This research has shown thatindividuals are acutely aware of the strategicimplications of communicating publicly asopposed to privately, and adjust their self-presentations accordingly (e.g. Baumeister,1982; Schlenker, 1980). For instance, indi-viduals consider the group membership of theaudience before expressing prejudiced views oropinions (Crandall, Eshelman, & O’Brien,2002; Klein, Licata, Azzi, & Durala, 2003). Fur-thermore, Tetlock (1981) showed that partici-pants’ public attributions for their actionsseemed tailor-made to create favorable impres-sions in others. In the group domain, groupmembers represented themselves as lessimportant than their colleagues in causing thegroup to succeed while privately they believedElder et al. audiences of group criticismthemselves to be just as important (Miller &Schlenker, 1985).Recent research suggests that as well asmanaging impressions of themselves, peoplemanage impressions of their group, respondingto the communicative context in doing so(Douglas & McGarty, 2001; Lambert, Cronen,Chasteen, & Lickel, 1996; Reicher, Spears, &Postmes, 1995). One reason for this might bethat people are aware of the representations oftheir group held by relevant outgroups; namely‘meta-stereotypes’ (Vorauer, Main, & O’Con-nell, 1998, p. 917). Individuals have a vestedinterest in these ‘meta-stereotypes’, because ifthey are negative, they threaten one’s valuedsocial identity, self-esteem, and the materialinterests of the group. Individuals may also ﬁndit harder to create and maintain a positivepublic presentation of themselves when theyare a member of a devalued group (Cialdini &Richardson, 1981; Eidelman & Biernat, 2003).Consistent with these concerns, Klein and Azzi(2001) found that when meta-stereotypes weresalient and when individuals thought that theirresponses would be available to outgroupmembers, they selected more positive traits andfewer negative traits as descriptors of theingroup.These ﬁndings raise an interesting and thusfar unanswered question. Given the collectiveinterest of members in the image of the group,does the tendency to present one’s groupfavorably in public settings take on somethingof the status of a prescriptive norm? That is, dopeople react adversely to criticism of theirgroup by fellow group members when it occurspublicly? In sociological ﬁeld studies of groupssuch as hotel workers, Goffman (1959) noted anorm of refraining from criticizing each otherin front of outgroup audiences such as hotelguests. He attributed this to a collective desireto cooperate in a dramaturgical presentation ofthe group to outsiders. According to Goffman,when intragroup criticisms were made publicly,one effect was ‘to provide the audience with aback-stage view’, and another was ‘to leave thefeeling that something is surely suspiciousabout a performance when those who knowbest do not agree’ (p. 185).23303 Elder (bc-s) 27/6/05 1:47 pm Page 234Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 8(3)of the message (public/private) in a single,between-groups design.1 We reasoned that indi-viduals may tolerate or even value intragroupcriticism when it is not available to outsiders,but may resent it when the image of the groupis potentially harmed by public criticism. Thuswe expect that the ISE will occur for criticismsmade in private but not in public contexts.MethodParticipants and design Participants were 203undergraduate students recruited on KeeleUniversity campus while at leisure (64 males,139 females, M = 19.09 years of age, SD = 1.42).The experiment consisted of a 2 (source:ingroup/outgroup) 2 (context: private/public) between-groups design. Participantswere randomly assigned to conditions.Analogously in social psychology, we haveindirect evidence that by refraining fromendorsing negative stereotypes beforeoutgroup audiences, people exhibit at least atacit awareness that their words and deeds willaffect the image of their group (cf. Klein &Azzi, 2001). They are likely to perceive thatpublic criticism adversely affects the valuedmeta-stereotype (Vorauer et al., 1998). There-fore when people publicly criticize their group,fellow ingroup members may respond harshly.In the present research, we examine theimportance of the context of communication inshaping reactions to intragroup and intergroupcriticisms. To date, no research has addressedthis issue; manipulations have addressed thegroup membership of the speaker (Hornseyet al., 2002), the extent to which the speakeridentiﬁes with the group (Hornsey et al., 2004),and the extent to which the speaker haspersonal experience of the group (Hornsey &Imani, 2004). In these studies by Hornsey andcolleagues, the context of criticisms has beenambiguous, described as taking place in aninterview, but where the audience privy to theinterview was not made explicit. In the study byO’Dwyer et al. (2002), stimulus criticisms hadallegedly been published in the critic’s schoolnewspaper. This meant that the criticisms weremade publicly but to an inclusive ingroupaudience (relative to the critic). Although theonly intended manipulation was the source ofthe criticism, the audience differed acrossconditions as well. The current research aims tosystematically examine the role of context inmoderating reactions to criticism from ingroupand outgroup members. Specifically, Experi-ment 1 manipulates the context of theaudience (criticism appears in private versuspublic domains) and the source of the criticism(ingroup or outgroup member). Experiment 2breaks down the context of the criticism byseparating the size of the audience and thecomposition of the audience.Materials and procedure As in Hornsey andcolleagues’ research (2002), participants wereinformed that the study was designed toexamine people’s perceptions of personalitytypes. On the ﬁrst page participants receivedidentical instructions in all four conditions,except for one line that was speciﬁc for the con-dition assigned, which read ‘these commentswere spoken by an undergraduate [someonewho didn’t go to university], in a privateconversation [and appeared in a nationalnewspaper]’.The ﬁrst line of the second page outlinedthe group membership of the critic and thecontext in which the comments were spoken.For example, for the ingroup private conditionparticipants read: ‘David Sanderson is a20-year-old second year undergraduate student[ofﬁce manager who decided against going touniversity]. In a private conversation [in anational newspaper], he made these commentsabout students’ (alternative wording foroutgroup critic and public context appears inparentheses).Participants were then presented withcomments attributed to the speaker which wereExperiment 1 based on negative press comments from themedia concerning students’ activities while atHere we manipulate both the source of the university. This criticism was used because ofmessage (ingroup/outgroup) and the context the likelihood that it would tap a salient and23403 Elder (bc-s) 27/6/05 1:47 pm Page 235commonly held stereotype. Comments fromthe ingroup member were presented as comingfrom a 20-year-old undergraduate studentcalled David Sanderson, who said:‘Most of us are from privileged, middle-class back-grounds, but we expect the taxpayer to support us.Many of us just drift into university because ofparental pressure or simply because we want to getdrunk and party. About 50% of students show upto the average lecture and seminar; much of theabsenteeism is down to the fact that we’re eitherspending our time and money in the pub, or we’rehungover from the night before.’Speaking about the current controversy on fees,Mr Sanderson said, ‘I strongly support top-up fees.We beneﬁt from our education, and so should payfor it. If fees were increased only those who arereally serious about their studies would go to uni-versity. The universities would also be able to puton better classes’.For the outgroup condition David Sandersonused third-person pronouns (‘them’ and‘they’) instead of ﬁrst-person pronouns (‘us’and ‘we’). The outgroup critic was allocated thestatus of ofﬁce manager in order to try andmatch his status with that of a universitystudent. If his title would have been officeworker or ofﬁce cleaner then ingroup membersmay perceive the comments as ‘sour grapes’because his position in society is lower thanwhat they would hope to achieve, making hiscriticism easier to dismiss.Once participants read the comments, theywere presented with Hornsey et al.’s (2002)sensitivity scale. Participants were asked ‘towhat extent do you think the comments were’:(followed by the words) ‘threatening’, ‘dis-appointing’, ‘irritating’, ‘offensive’, ‘insulting’,‘hypocritical’, ‘judgmental’ and ‘arrogant’.Participants responded on a Likert scale (1 =not at all, 7 = very much). The sensitivity scale wasreliable = .82.In addition we also measured the anger feltby the participants after reading the comments,using the four-item scale by O’Dwyer et al.(2002), for example: ‘How annoyed do you feelafter reading these comments?’ ( = .88). Asingle item was also included to assess partici-pants’ agreement with the speaker’s comments.This was measured by asking: ‘how much doElder et al. audiences of group criticismyou agree with the comments?’ (Hornsey et al.,2002).Questions were then asked to tap into par-ticipants’ perceptions of the speaker. Thesequestions related to the morality of the critic,the critic’s motive, competency of the critic, andthe effect of the critic’s comments. Morality wasmeasured because it may be possible that par-ticipants believe that by going public with criti-cism of their ingroup the speaker is breakingsome form of moral code. The morality itemswere: ‘the speaker should make comments likethese’, ‘it was wrong of the speaker to makethese comments’ (reverse coded), and ‘bymaking these comments the speaker was doingthe right thing’ ( = .68). Motive was assessedbecause when an ingroup member criticizestheir group publicly their intentions may be seenas less honorable. Motive was measured usingthe following four questions: ‘this speaker hadstudents’ interests at heart’, ‘this speaker’sintentions were honorable’, ‘this speaker’scomments were intended to beneﬁt students’and ‘this speaker was trying to be constructive’( = .75). Competency was included becauseprevious research has shown critics’ groupmembership to affect perceptions of how quali-ﬁed they are to comment on the group. Com-petency was measured with the following items:‘the speaker’s comments were well-informed’,‘the speaker was qualified to make thesecomments’ and ‘this speaker has enoughexperience of students to make thesecomments’ ( = .80). The ﬁrst two items wereadapted from Hornsey et al.’s legitimacy scale.The ﬁnal scale was included to measure theperceived effect of the comments, given thatpublic criticism could be perceived as having amore negative effect on the group than privatecriticism. The effect items were: ‘this speaker’scomments will positively affect students’ image’,‘this speaker’s comments will have a positiveimpact on university education’, and ‘thisspeaker’s comments will beneﬁt students’ ( =.69). These scales appeared together, inrandom order, and participants responded on aLikert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = stronglyagree). Once participants completed thesequestions they were thanked and debriefed.23503 Elder (bc-s)27/6/051:47 pmPage 236Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 8(3)Results and discussionPreliminary analyses To verify that our depen-dent measures assessed separate constructs, andto identify any problematic cross-mappings, wesubjected our measures to factor analyses. Toverify that sensitivity (Hornsey et al., 2002) andanger (O’Dwyer et al., 2002) are different con-structs, we entered all items from both scalesinto a factor analysis. As these two constructswere interrelated (r = .516), we used obliquerotation. This produced a two-factor solution,with the ﬁrst factor comprising the anger items(eigenvalue = 5.05, 42.10% of the varianceexplained) and the second factor including thesensitivity items (eigenvalue = 1.65, 13.75% ofthe variance explained). Therefore, these scaleswere treated as separate constructs.A similar analysis was used to determinewhether motive, effect, competency, andmorality scales assessed the intended con-structs. Once more oblique rotation was usedgiven that these constructs tended to be inter-related (r = .003 to .517 with the average corre-lation approximately .30). This revealed athree-factor solution, with the ﬁrst factor com-prising the motive and effect items (eigenvalue= 4.30, 33.09% of the variance explained) andthe second factor the competency items (eigen-value = 1.91, 14.72% of the variance explained).Because both effect and motive loaded on thesame factor, we combined these scales into asingle scale we labelled consequences. This newscale combined the effect of the comments asestimated by the participants and as perceivedto be intended by the speaker ( = .80). Thisclose correspondence in motives and effectsuggests that participants believe the speaker tohave intended or at least to have been aware ofthe likely effect of his or her comments. Thethird factor comprised the morality items(eigenvalue = 1.30, 9.29% of the varianceexplained). We therefore analyzed results forconsequences, competency, and morality.Main effects and interactions for evaluations ofthe comments Results were entered into a 2(source: ingroup/outgroup) 2 (context:public/private) between-groups analysis ofvariance (ANOVA). Means and F values arepresented in Table 1.

Private commentsare often accessible only to ingroup members,whereas comments made publicly tend to beaccessible to people from different groups.However context and composition are concep-tually separable, and are separable in practicetoo. Given that we tend to belong to a multi-tude of social groups, it is probably quitecommon for people to talk about their owngroup, in private, to outgroup members. Toillustrate, it is quite likely that students talkabout other students when at home with theirfamilies. Further, some communicative settingsare importantly public, but at the same timeunlikely to be scrutinized by outgroupmembers. For example, internet sites forspecial interest groups are available to thepublic but not likely to be regularly inhabitedby outgroup members. Comments made insuch contexts are public but may well ﬁnd apurely ingroup audience. So public communi-cation does not always entail intergroup com-munication, even if public communicationentails the possibility that outgroup memberswill receive the message.It is the aim of this experiment to tease apartthe variables of audience size and composition,which are somewhat confounded in the ﬁrstexperiment. Therefore, it manipulates both thesize of the audience (context is public orprivate) and composition of the audience(audience consists of ingroup or outgroupmembers), in a fully between-groups design. Asthere was no effect of context for the outgroupcritic in the ﬁrst experiment, all criticism in thenext experiment will be presented as intra-group criticism.There are also other methodological changesin this experiment. In both the pilot study1 andthe first experiment the critic advocatedincreased tuition fees as part of their criticismof students. This issue of ‘top-up’ fees was par-ticularly topical at the time and helped to con-textualize the criticism. However, we wereconcerned that this suggested implementationof a policy that would hurt students’ interestscould be responsible for increased sensitivity in238public contexts. Therefore, the current experi-ment manipulated whether or not thecomments about top-up fees were included inthe criticisms. We also included an additionalscale by Hornsey et al. (2002) to examinewhether perceptions of the speaker’s personal-ity would differ depending on the context ofthe criticism.MethodParticipants and design Participants were 200undergraduate students (70 male, 130 female,M = 19.80 years of age, SD = 3.31).

Forexample, in the large ingroup audience con-dition it stated that: ‘These comments were spokenby an undergraduate student interviewed on studentradio [Radio 2] where less than 1% of listeners arenon-students [students]’. Alternatively, for thesmaller ingroup audience condition theinstructions were: ‘These comments were spoken byan undergraduate student, in a private conversationwith only other students [non-students] present’.Participants then turned the page and wereinformed of the audience size and composition.For example, in the small audience conditionparticipants were informed that: ‘Whilst in aprivate conversation in his halls of residence with onlyother students present [with his family and friendswho are not students], he made these comments aboutstudents’. In the large audience condition thisread: ‘Whilst being interviewed on student radio[Radio 2], he made these comments about students’.Participants then proceeded to read the samenegative script about students as in Experiment1, except that for half the participants, the com-mentary concerning top-up fees was deletedfrom the criticism. Measures were also identical03 Elder (bc-s)27/6/051:47 pmPage 239to Experiment 1 except for the inclusion ofHornsey et al.’s (2002) personality evaluationscale. This asked ‘to what extent do you thinkthe speaker is’: (followed by the words) ‘intelli-gent’, ‘trustworthy’, ‘friendly’, ‘open-minded’,‘likeable’, ‘nice’, ‘respected’, and ‘interesting’( = .88). Participants completed the samesensitivity ( = .90), anger ( = .96), motives( = .77), morality ( = .70), competency ( =.78), and effect ( = .66) scales, as well as theagreement item.Results and discussionPreliminary analyses Initial factor analysesalso replicated the factor structures observedfor Experiment 1 and showed Hornsey et al.’s(2002) personality evaluation scale to bedistinct from other measures. In order to ruleout the possibility that commentary concerningtop-up fees in the script was altering reactionsto the criticism, we also conducted initialANOVAs including this factor (top-up fees:included/excluded). For sensitivity, there wasno main effect of top-up fees (F(1, 192) = 3.29,Elder et al.audiences of group criticismp = .079), nor crucially any interaction withaudience composition (F(1, 192) = .73, p = .39);or audience size (F(1, 192) = .11, p = .74); andno three-way interaction between top-up fees,audience composition, and size (F(1, 192) =.001, p = .98). Similarly, for personality evalu-ations, there was no main effect of top-up fees(F(1, 192) = .10, p = .75), nor any interactionwith audience composition (F(1, 192) = 1.42,p = .24); or audience size (F(1, 192) = .002,p = .96); and no three-way interaction betweentop-up fees, audience composition, and size(F(1, 192) = 2.02, p = .16). Therefore, top-upfees as a variable was dropped from furtheranalyses.Main effects and interactions for evaluation ofthe comments Results were then analyzedwith 2 (audience composition: ingroup/outgroup) 2 (audience size: private/public)between-groups ANOVAs. Means and F valuesare presented in Table 2. As predicted, a sig-niﬁcant main effect of audience compositionwas found for sensitivity. Participants were moreTable 2.

Ingroup members do notwant the group’s shortcomings to be heard byoutsiders. However, for sensitivity there was nomain effect of audience size. This suggests thatthe composition of the audience, and not itssize, affects sensitivity. The results also show, asin Experiment 1, sensitivity is greatest when theoutgroup critic speaks to a small outgroupaudience, perhaps because ingroup membersare not able to respond to the criticism.Participants were also more angered bythe critic’s comments when they were spokento the outgroup audience (M = 4.04) than tothe ingroup audience (M = 3.54) (p = .039,2 = .022). For agreement, there were no maineffects or interactions for audience composi-tion and audience size. Thus, although thesource of otherwise identical messages affectsagreement (Experiment 1; also see Hornseyet al., 2002), characteristics of the perceivedaudience do not. Clearly, source and contexthave different effects on evaluative reactions tocomments.Main effects and interactions for evaluationsof the speaker As suggested by our factoranalyses, motive and effect were combined intoa single scale we labeled consequences ( = .83).For consequences of the criticism, there was amain effect of audience composition, withmore positive consequences perceived whenthe speaker addressed an ingroup audience(M = 3.03) compared with an outgroupaudience (M = 2.71) (p = .018, 2 = .029). Inaddition, when the critic spoke to the ingroupaudience he was perceived as more moral (M =4.07) than when he spoke to the outgroupaudience (M = 3.82), although this effect wasmarginal (p = .09, 2 = .014). For morality therewas also a main effect of audience size withparticipants perceiving the speaker as possess-ing greater morality when speaking to a smallaudience (M = 4.38) than when speaking to alarge audience (M = 3.52) (p = .001, 2 = .140).This supports the suggestion that the moral rulesor norms governing intragroup communication240are dependent on the social context in whichthe comments are expressed. If the speakergoes ‘on the record’ and speaks to a largeaudience then they may no longer be perceivedas doing what is right for the group. Theingroup speaker was also perceived as morecompetent when criticizing the group to aningroup audience (M = 3.74) than to anoutgroup audience (M = 3.30) (p = .011, 2 =.033). This suggests that although the criticismspresented were identical, the speaker was per-ceived as having greater experience and qualiﬁ-cations to make these negative comments abouttheir own group when they kept the criticism‘in house’. As predicted, there was a signiﬁcantmain effect of audience for ratings of personal-ity evaluations. Finally, participants evaluatedthe ingroup critic’s personality more favorablywhen he criticized the group before ingroupmembers (M = 3.69) rather than outgroupmembers (M = 3.37) (p = .015, 2 = .030). Again,this is consistent with our rationale that partici-pants will not perceive the speaker favorablywhen the criticism is taken beyond the conﬁnesof the ingroup.General discussionThe current research is the ﬁrst to assess theimpact of communicative context on reactionsto intergroup and intragroup criticism. Ourﬁrst experiment manipulated both the sourceof the criticism (ingroup versus outgroupspeaker) and the context of the criticism(public versus private) and showed that the ISEonly occurred when criticisms were made inprivate. When the comments appeared inpublic they were no more welcomed from aningroup member than from an outgroupmember. The second experiment aimed toclarify whether the preference for privateingroup criticism was due to the smaller size ofthe audience or the fact that it was composedof ingroup rather than outgroup members. Theﬁndings demonstrated that increased sensitivityand derogation of the speaker was associatedwith taking the criticism to outsiders. There-fore, it seems that an ingroup critic speakingto an ingroup audience is seen as ‘clearing the03 Elder (bc-s) 27/6/05 1:47 pm Page 241air’ by highlighting the group’s weaknesses,thereby promoting growth and improvement(see Nemeth & Owens, 1996), but whenspeaking to an outgroup audience, he or sheis perceived to be ‘airing the group’s dirtylaundry’.Our replication of the ISE supports theoreti-cal claims that there are norms governing inter-group criticism (Hornsey et al., 2002; see alsoFranco & Maass, 1996). Our demonstrationthat this effect disappears in public, whereingroup critics are less well received, suggeststhat there are also norms governing intragroupcriticism. The norms governing each kind ofcriticism appear to be somewhat different;while reactions to intergroup criticism were notgreatly affected by the context in which itappeared, participants were clearly morepiqued by intragroup criticism that could reachan outgroup audience. Indeed, intragroup criti-cism was judged to be less moral when made inpublic, showing that people are perceived to beless entitled to criticize their group in publicthan in private. Furthermore, intragroup criti-cism before an outgroup audience was per-ceived as having more negative consequencesand the speaker was judged to be less compe-tent than when the criticism was made to aningroup audience.These ﬁndings are consistent with a norma-tive expectation that group members shouldcollaborate to foster a desired public image oftheir group (Goffman, 1959; Klein & Azzi,2001). Criticizing one’s own group in publicmay affirm negative meta-stereotypes to thedetriment of the group (Vorauer et al., 1998).These ﬁndings also suggest that when peoplespeak to outgroup members about theiringroup’s weaknesses, this can change our per-ceptions of the speaker’s motivations and per-sonality. In this context we no longer see themas well-intentioned and well-informed.The effects of context and source onreactions to criticism found in the presentexperiments demonstrate the impact of speciﬁ-cally communicative variables on reactions togroup criticism. For example, people’s toler-ance of criticism may differ depending onwhether the critic is identiﬁable. IdentiﬁabilityElder et al. audiences of group criticismhas a range of implications for how ingroupand outgroup members are perceived andtreated. Intuitively, one might expect greatertolerance of identiﬁable critics on the groundsthat they are prepared to be accountable fortheir comments, but in fact this may interactwith source and context (Douglas & McGarty,2001; Reicher & Levine, 1994a, 1994b; Reicheret al., 1995).Another potential moderating variable is thestatus of the outgroup speaker. In Experiment1 we described the ingroup critic as a 20-year-old undergraduate student and the outgroupcritic as a 20-year-old office manager whodecided against going to university. The aimwas to try and match the two critics in terms ofboth age and status. However, recent researchsuggests that speakers’ perceived status canmoderate the ISE (Tarrant, 2005). We thereforeacknowledge that it may have been advan-tageous in the ﬁrst experiment to use multipleoutgroup speakers of different status random-ized across conditions.To conclude, the present ﬁndings show thatreactions to intragroup and intergroup criti-cism depend importantly on the context inwhich criticism appears. Criticisms seem to bepreferred from ingroup members rather thanoutgroup members, but not when taken intothe intergroup domain. This preference strikesus as being, to a large degree, rational; makingcriticisms of one’s group in public contextswhere they are available to outgroup memberswould indeed appear to put the group’s imageat risk, with little beneﬁt to the ingroup relativeto more discreet forms of communication. Ourresults point to a rather subtle set of normsgoverning the criticism of groups, and high-light the interaction between communicativefactors such as source and context. In doing so,they underscore the essentially communicativenature of group processes and intergrouprelations.Note1. Before conducting this study we ran a pilot usingthese materials and an ambiguous context as inHornsey et al. (2002) where the extent to which24103 Elder (bc-s)27/6/051:47 pmPage 242Group Processes & Intergroup Relations 8(3)comments were public or private was notspeciﬁed. The purpose of this was to ensure thatour different intergroup and national contextproduced the same results as in the original ISEstudies. Participants were 84 undergraduatestudents at Keele University (26 male, 58 female,M = 19.27 years of age, SD = 1.95). Results wereanalyzed as a two-group between-subjects design(source: ingroup/outgroup critic). As predicted,criticisms from an outgroup member resulted ingreater sensitivity (M = 4.87) than when the samecomments were made by an ingroup member(M = 4.34) (F(1, 82) = 4.76, p = .032, 2 = .06).This result shows that the present materialsproduce an ISE in ambiguous communicativecontexts as found by Hornsey et al. (2002).AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Mark Tarrant, Scott Reid,and two anonymous reviewers for their astute andhelpful comments on earlier versions of this paper.References<ref>Albright, L., Cohen, A.
