There is a low rate of female labour marketparticipation in the formal sector, yet a higher proportion of womenprofessors than in any of the 25 European Union countries. We use a range ofdata to set the Turkish labour market and its higher education sector incomparative European perspective, then present ﬁndings from two qualitativestudies of Turkish professors, concluding that ideological state support ratherthan legal frameworks of equal opportunities laid the foundations for women’shierarchical achievements in Turkey. However, the explanation is multilayeredand lies in the cumulative and interrelated effect of state policy, institutionaltransparency, increased labour demand, the home–work interface, and theagency of the professors themselves.IntroductionAt the end of 2004, the EU agreed to open accession talks which couldlead to Turkey’s membership of the Union. Its candidacy, if successful,would realize the key national project of modernization and westerniza-tion, which has been central to Turkey’s dominant state ideology. Turkeyis often excluded from comparative studies of European employment, yetthere are good reasons to include it.There are important paradoxes in employment relations in Turkey:women have one of the lowest rates of employment participation inEurope, yet some beneﬁt from limited vertical segregation which wouldbe envied by their European sisters. In particular, women achieve morehierarchically in the professions and academia than their contemporariesin western Europe and elsewhere (Acar, 1993).Across the industrialized world, feminist, human rights and civilDOI: 10.1177/095968010505396608_053966_Healy (ds) 25/5/05 1:23 pm Page 248European Journal of Industrial Relations 11(2)liberties movements have achieved legal solutions for the eliminationof discrimination against women. In practice, the impact of anti-discriminatory legislation is often limited to widening women’s access toemployment, but has had less success in challenging vertical segregation.In Turkey, by contrast, anti-discrimination legislation is less advanced,but vertical segregation is lower. We examine this paradox by comparingpatterns of women’s activity rates in Europe with those of Turkey; thenfocus speciﬁcally on academic employment. To understand what thesemacro and meso data mean at the level of the actor (that is, the livedexperience of professorial employment), we use qualitative studies ofprofessors in Turkish universities.To situate Turkey in its international context, we use Turkish data fromthe Directorate General of Women’s Status and Problems in Ankara andEU data from Eurostat and from Women in Science. To gain insight intothe policies and regulations on Turkish academic employment in generaland conditions of advancement to full professorial posts in particular,documentary data were obtained from YÖK (the governing body of theTurkish higher education sector) and the State Institute of Statistics.Lastly, we undertook two qualitative studies, involving 57 semi-structured interviews of Turkish full professors (30 men and 27 women).The research was limited to ‘full’ professors, deﬁned as academic workersholding professorial chairs at universities subject to YÖK’s progressioncriteria. They were drawn from six universities in Istanbul and ﬁve inAnkara, since professors in these cities face fewer structural constraintsassociated with their geographical career mobility.The interview schedule consisted of 32 questions exploring the socio-economic and institutional proﬁles of the respondents and allowing thema degree of freedom to determine the issues that they wished to discusswithin a broad framework of sex equality, career development, and highereducation in Turkey. Interviews were undertaken in Turkish and the tran-scripts translated into English.Women’s Activity Rates: Turkey in ComparativePerspectiveTurkey has one of the lowest female economic participation rates inEurope — one which actually decreased from 34 percent in 1990 to 23percent in 1995. The vast majority work in the agricultural sector asunpaid family workers, while employment in the non-agricultural andnon-rural sectors is highly marginal not only quantitatively, but also interms of concentration in traditional female sectors such as textiles andthe food industry. Urban unemployment rates for women are more thandouble those of men; the informal sector provides the greatest work24808_053966_Healy (ds) 25/5/05 1:23 pm Page 249Healy et al.: Academic Employment and Genderopportunity for urban women from low-income households, whichmeans that they are typically excluded from the legal and social protec-tion and beneﬁts available in the formal sector.Figure 1 ranks female economic activity rates as a proportion ofmen’s among European countries, showing that Turkey ranks 23rd,above only Cyprus, Italy, Greece, Spain and Malta. The Turkish experi-ence of liberalization has not increased women’s participation in thelabour market; rather, its unplanned nature, coupled with high levels ofinternal migration from rural to urban areas in the past decade, has led toFIGURE 1.

Women’s relative partici-pation rates increase with their educational levels, and this is particularlymarked for those with tertiary-level education. Nevertheless, OECD(2004) data indicate that women with tertiary education still havecomparatively low levels of activity: below all other European countries,on a par with Japan, and above only Korea and Mexico.It is noteworthy that the 12 European countries with the highestactivity rates for women are the four Nordic countries and eight of thecentral and eastern European (CEE) countries. The lowest activity ratestend to be in southern Europe. The extent to which these ﬁgures aredirectly comparable has been questioned by a number of commentators,since different deﬁnitions of employment, unemployment, and inactivitysigniﬁcantly affect the data. For example, the southern countries, includ-ing Turkey, tend to have a high share of informal-sector work. Within theEurostat deﬁnitions of economic activity, the trend among women istowards increasing employment rates and decreasing inactivity rates(Rubery et al., 1998).Academic Employment and Gender EqualityGiven the very low economic activity rates of Turkish women, and thepredominantly Muslim population, it may surprise many westerncommentators that the proportion of women academics who achieveprofessorial status is very high (Özbilgin and Healy, 2004; Woodwardand Özbilgin, 1998). Thus gender equality in Turkish academicemployment can provide comparative insights to relate to the findingsof other country-specific studies.1A prerequisite of women’s success in academia is their prior success intertiary education. In 2002, the average percentage of graduates who werewomen was 55.9 percent in the EU-15 and 63.7 percent in the accessioncountries. In science in general and in engineering and manufacturing,there was a higher percentage of women graduates in the accession coun-tries (48 percent and 25.6 percent, respectively) than in the EU-15 (41percent and 20.9 percent, respectively). Turkey stands out as having alower proportion of women graduates (42.9 percent) than any of the EU-25 or associated countries. However, the feminized subject bias is lessentrenched in Turkey, with women representing 44.4 percent of sciencegraduates and 34.8 percent of those in engineering and manufacturing(Eurostat, 2004). However, Palaz (2000) argues that recent trends indicatea shift towards a more western style of horizontal gender segregation,25008_053966_Healy (ds) 25/5/05 1:23 pm Page 251Healy et al.: Academic Employment and Genderwith women entering the arts, humanities and vocational education ingreater numbers than in the past.Figure 2 shows the average percentage of women academics in theEU-25 as 34.8 percent. There is, however, a wide range, from Latvia,where women make up more than 50 percent of academics to Irelandwhere they are only 24.6 percent. Of the 13 countries above the mean,six (including the top four) are from the CEE, two (Spain and Portugal)from southern Europe, and three from the Nordic countries, togetherwith the UK. Turkey is also just above the mean. There is no clearpattern by groupings of countries; nor does the gendered distributionof academic employment match national rankings of economic activityrates.Figure 2 also shows that in the EU-25, women are far moreFIGURE 2.

Some 11 countries are above the mean: four fromthe CEE (of which only Latvia and Bulgaria have a higher than averageproportion of women academics) and four from southern Europe, plusBelgium and the UK. At 27 percent, Turkey has the highest proportionof professors who are women in Europe, almost twice the mean. Curi-ously, countries with a long history of egalitarian policies, such asNorway and Denmark, are below the mean.Data from the European Technology Assessment Network (ETAN,2000) show that in many countries the percentage of female full professorsslowly increased in the 1990s. In Poland, for example, women were 9.4percent of titular professors in 1977, 16.6 percent in 1988, 20 percent in1990, and 21.9 percent in 1996. While these kinds of data are not generallyavailable, its report also provides the example of Germany, where year-onyear-increases are not evident. On average in the EU, percentages ofwomen professors seem to be increasing by 0.5–1.0 percent a year — at thisrate it would take a century to attain a gender balance (ETAN, 2000: 12).There are many possible reasons for Turkish women’s academic achieve-ments, many rooted in speciﬁc historical, social, and economic contexts.Before turning to these, we pursue a more generic explanation: womensucceed when men leave an occupation because the rewards are greaterelsewhere. Reskin and Roos (1990) argue that men may vacate certainsectors or occupations if terms and conditions of employment decline, andthat women can compensate for the resulting labour shortages. While thisargument may have some resonance in particular countries, our ownresearch suggests that it does not hold good if the gendered distribution ofprofessorial appointments is compared cross-nationally with academic pay(adjusted for purchasing power) (Özbilgin and Healy, 2004).Historical Forces and Women’s Achievements in TurkeyThe dominant state ideology in Turkey has historically been a majorfactor in understanding vertical segregation, a factor shared with CEEaccession countries. The foundation of the new Turkish Republic in theearly 1920s led to a series of reforms aiming to nationalize and secular-ize the higher education sector. The move from the earlier Seljuk andOttoman systems to the contemporary university system embodied ashift in emphasis from Turkish-Islamic to westernized models, and froma nationalized system to one which is governed by a neo-liberal inter-nationalist approach (Güvenç, 1997). These changes can be periodizedinto three phases.The first phase, in the 1920s and 1930s, led to the entry of womeninto academic employment through a set of principles (secularism,25208_053966_Healy (ds) 25/5/05 1:23 pm Page 253Healy et al.: Academic Employment and Genderrepublicanism, populism, statism, reformism and nationalism) intro-duced by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of the modern TurkishRepublic. These principles were part of a modernization project latersynonymous with the concept of ‘Kemalism’. The principles wereconsolidated in the second phase of transformation from the 1940s tothe 1980s, as the number of women academics gradually increased(YÖK, 2004). A relatively stable growth rate of the university sectorhas been replaced since 1985 by a third phase of rapid expansion.The ﬁrst two phases underpinned an ideological sanctioning ofwomen’s careers in academia and the professions. The Kemalist principlesof republican secularism upheld the value of sex equality over and againsta strong tradition of sex segregation originating from the Ottoman times(Öncü, 1981; Özkanli and Korkmaz, 2000). Legislation requiring sexequality in employment was rudimentary (Özbilgin, 2002; Woodwardand Özbilgin, 1999),2 but of critical importance was that the dominantideologies of ‘modernization’ and ‘westernization’ gave priority to theelimination of overtly discriminatory policies and practices from theformal processes of public employment.Though the post-communist countries are also shaped by a stateideology of sex equality, the ideological differences with Turkey areprofound. James (1996: 45, 59) asserts that under communist rule, womenwere strongly encouraged to enter the labour force, but that the policieswere designed to foster equal numerical participation in the labour force,not equal access to high-status jobs and wages. To facilitate numericalparticipation, childcare and maternity leave were heavily subsidized bythe government (although this subsidy has been substantially reduced inthe market economy). This facilitated women’s relatively high economicactivity rate. Analogous ideological and practical supports also underliethe high participation rates in the Nordic countries.Zeytino g˘lu (1999) and Kandiyoti (1997) noted that academic careerswere historically and socially constructed and sex-typed as ‘safe’ and‘proper’ choices for graduate women in Turkey. Women were sociallyencouraged to take up professional employment, as opposed to entre-preneurial or commercial careers, since these were considered harmoni-ous with the potent image of ‘a respectful Turkish woman’. This ideologywas effective in demarcating women’s careers in ‘safe’, ‘secure’, and‘esteemed’ forms of professional employment.Neo-Liberalism, the Decline of ‘State Feminism’, andUniversity ExpansionThe transformation of the political and social landscape in Turkey threat-ens to reverse these equality gains in academia and dissolve the impact of25308_053966_Healy (ds) 25/5/05 1:23 pm Page 254European Journal of Industrial Relations 11(2)‘state feminism’ (White, 2003). First, since the 1980s Turkey has pursueda neo-liberal economic programme, weakening government labourmarket regulation. This has diluted the traditional sex equality discourseof the republican ideology pursued by the state in all sectors, includinghigher education. Second, there have emerged political parties andeconomic institutions that advocate sex segregation, in clear oppositionto the principles of secularism. Nevertheless, the current leading party,the AKP, despite its Islamic agenda, has adopted a liberal approach anddiscourse.These two changes have led to a shift in social attitudes. The image ofrepublican Turkish women, expected to ‘self-sacriﬁce’ and ‘pioneer’ forthe advancement of the nation, has lost its inﬂuence on a new generationof young women graduates (Özbilgin and Woodward, 2003). It could beargued that, like their counterparts in other European countries, manywomen in modern Turkey perceive their careers with individualizedaspirations rather than a collectivist sense of fulﬁlling a national duty.Thus, as the nationalistic and republican signiﬁcance of women’s employ-ment in non-traditional disciplines is declining in Turkey, traditionalmethods of eliminating sex-typing and segregation of academic careersare following suit in higher education.Alongside the fragmentation of state ideology, there have been signiﬁ-cant sectoral changes in the past two decades. The expansion of theuniversity sector since the early 1990s has created greater opportunitiesfor career mobility for both female and male academics. Between 1990and 2004, the number of universities increased from 29 to 76; the numberof state universities almost doubled and there was also an emergence ofprivate universities. The number of academic staff increased from 28,114in 1989 to 60,129 in 1999, and professorial posts from 2772 to 8804 in thesame period, increasing to 10,080 in 2003 (YÖK, 2004). Between 1990and 2000 the number of full professors increased by 75 percent (Aytaçand Aytaç, 2001: 17). The skills shortages which resulted from this expan-sion enabled increased access for women and were also largely respons-ible for mobilizing the upward progression of the otherwise relativelystatic careers of many academic staff in this sector.While student participation has increased in Europe, this increase hasnot necessarily led to comparable career opportunities, given the shiftfrom ‘elite’ to ‘mass’ in higher education delivery. Nevertheless, Enders(2002) argues that academic staff in Portugal and Spain beneﬁted fromexpansion; and as noted above, these are the two southern Europeancountries with rankings for women’s academic employment above theEuropean average.Expansion of the sector in Turkey occurred alongside a deteriorationof pay and conditions in the ‘old’ universities in the state sector, ascompared to the ‘new’ private universities. It is unclear how the growth25408_053966_Healy (ds) 25/5/05 1:23 pm Page 255Healy et al.: Academic Employment and Genderof private universities will affect the gender order, given their relativelysmall share (only 3 percent) in the sector (Aytaç and Aytaç, 2001: 20).Özgüç (1998) suggested that male graduates traditionally pursued careerswhich offered the best ﬁnancial prospects and had limited and declininginterest in academic careers because salaries were lower than in the privatesector. This has resonance with the gender queues argument of Reskin andRoos (1990), which suggests that changing market conditions may lead tothe feminizing of previously contested jobs. In the case of Turkey, as inSpain and Portugal, it is new jobs that are offering women opportunities.Centralization of Rule Making: YÖKOne of the inﬂuences on women’s academic development involves theinstitutional level. The governance of the university sector has been trans-formed from a decentralized system in the 1970s to one of centralization,embodied by YÖK, in the 1980s and the 1990s. YÖK and its variouspolicies, which were often considered gender neutral, had a signiﬁcantgendered impact on the careers of female professors. Particular changesin YÖK legislation, with a direct impact on the career development ofacademic staff, deﬁned the performance criteria and mobility require-ments that regulated professorial promotions. YÖK has been criticizedby many universities, academic staff, and their unions and associations(TUSIAD, 2000: 113), and challenges to its status have resulted in some30 revisions to its constitution since its establishment in 1981.Nevertheless, the promotion system in the Turkish higher educationsector has a high degree of transparency compared to European coun-tries. YÖK regulations require professorial vacancies to be advertised inone of the ﬁve highest circulation daily newspapers in Turkey (Özbilginand Healy, 2004: 7). Candidates have to provide a portfolio includingtheir CVs, details of their scientiﬁc publications, educational and trainingactivities, supervision of research degrees, and overall contribution totheir current institution. Three conditions are speciﬁed for promotion tofull professorship: ﬁrst, applicants should have served at least ﬁve yearsat associate professor grade in a discipline closely associated with theprofessorial post sought; second, they should have a portfolio of originalresearch publications produced at an international level; and, third, theyshould be selected for a professorial post (TUBA, 2004; YÖK, 1998).These regulations make no implicit or explicit reference to sex equalityissues, such as direct or indirect discrimination in promotion or selectionprocesses. Once candidates qualify through YÖK for a professorial chair,they must also be appointed to a chair by their local university in orderfor their title to be recognized. Each Turkish university, both state andprivate, has its own promotion system; some are reportedly tougher than25508_053966_Healy (ds) 25/5/05 1:23 pm Page 256European Journal of Industrial Relations 11(2)the YÖK procedure, placing heavier emphasis on research output in theform of international publications (Özkanli and Korkmaz, 2000: 85).This creates a two-track employment system.Nevertheless, Özbilgin and Healy (2004: 8) argue that this standard-ized system of recruitment is more open and, in principle, providesgreater equality of access to full professorial posts than in many othercountries, where such standardization is rare. The appointment of pro-fessors in Europe and the US often involves multiple systems; many ofthese are obscure, allow variable criteria for appointment, and often relyon internal labour markets. The most open systems rely on the require-ment for similar attributes to those under the YÖK system. While manywestern academics assume that their professorial appointment systemsare of an equal or superior academic level to those of other, particularlyless developed, countries, such assumptions should be questionedparticularly in debates on gender equity. The ETAN (2000: viii) reporton mainstreaming gender equality in Europe stated that old-fashionedpractices permeate employment and promotion procedures in manyacademic institutions: patronage, ‘old boys’ networks’, and personal invi-tations to ﬁll posts cut across ‘fair and effective employment procedures’.Despite the greater transparency in the Turkish system, it is importantto recognize that competition for posts in particular universities andorganizational politics militate against universally equitable outcomes(Özbilgin and Healy, 2004: 8). In this, Turkey shares a common experi-ence with western European and North American university systems.The Lived Experiences of Turkish ProfessorsWe now turn to qualitative evidence at the microlevel. While we acknowl-edge women’s achievement in academic work in Turkey, it is importantto remember that those who achieve hierarchical success are still rela-tively rare. To explore the perceptions of men and women professors, wefocus on two key interrelated elements of their employment relation-ships: the home–work interface and structures of discrimination.Home–Work InterfaceThere are both universal and nationally speciﬁc dimensions to ourﬁndings. Though Turkish women have attained professional careers forsome eight decades, the traditional family ideology and gender divisionof labour, which assigned carer and domestic roles to women and bread-winner roles to men, remains the main social frame of reference (Peker,1996). Our study of senior academics reveals a near universal picture ofgendered domestic roles and responsibilities. Women are responsible for25608_053966_Healy (ds) 25/5/05 1:23 pm Page 257Healy et al.: Academic Employment and Gendermanaging the household; men ‘help’ rather than sharing domestic tasks.The ‘normality’ of this was indicated by an apparent lack of associationbetween domestic responsibilities and career development. None of ourmale respondents mentioned family affairs as hindering their promotion(one stated that ‘I’m involved in my own academic tasks usually, some-times I help her with the housework’), but nor did female professorsrecognize structural barriers. They reported that they were largelycontent with (or perhaps resigned to) their dual roles, and often normal-ized the burden caused by domestic work by failing to question the roledistribution.The following statement by a female professor is typical: ‘Actuallyfamily did not hinder me but when my children were younger I had difﬁ-culties in doing research, teaching, working and also taking care of thehouse’. Another explained this paradoxical situation:I believe that there is equality between the sexes. However, once youenter the academic profession, the difﬁculties they [women and men] faceare different. However much men help, responsibilities of caring for thefamily and children are expected of women . . . It is very positive for awoman to have an academic career. It has high social status. It is notimportant if she earns less. However, if men earn less, they are victimized.The paradox is complicated by the expectation that women will marryupward socially, and those who are highly qualiﬁed thus ﬁnd a reducedpool of potential partners. Accordingly, some 41 percent of womenacademics are married to other academics (Özkanli and Korkmaz, 2000:30). The established gender order in the home constrains such women’semployment ‘choices’ (Healy, 1999). Dual-career families in the study,and other female academics, often employed domestic help to redress theimbalance in the share of domestic work. A male professor explained that‘having assistance reduces my wife’s domestic responsibilities. We have acommercial cleaning service. My wife is responsible for cooking’.Female respondents recognized gendered structural constraints formen and suggested that ‘ﬁnancial responsibilities of being a man’ and‘compulsory military service’ are the main hindrances for men’s careeradvancement in the sector. One male professor stated that barriers tocareer development exist only for men for these reasons, while other mensaw marriage and childcare as important barriers to women’s careerdevelopment. Neither marriage nor childcare appeared to constitute aproblem for male respondents.Women respondents appreciated men’s help and contribution to theircareer. ‘My mother and father supported me both in material and spiritualways until I lost them,’ said one. ‘Since I got married, my husband hasbeen supporting me by being understanding about my work andexchanging ideas with me’. Only ﬁve of the 30 male professors25708_053966_Healy (ds) 25/5/05 1:23 pm Page 258European Journal of Industrial Relations 11(2)acknowledged the support of their immediate families; another ﬁve citedsupport received from their colleagues.3 As well as the support of theirimmediate families, female professors mentioned friends and colleagues.PhD supervisors were highlighted as important sources of support atboth the academic and emotional level.The role of signiﬁcant others, particularly partners, is a recurringtheme in the literature on women’s achievement (Healy and Kraithman,1996; Ledwith et al., 1991). Deem (2003), in her study of womenacademics in the UK, found that most women raised gender issuesranging from inequitable household and motherhood responsibilities tosexist behaviour by some male colleagues and discrimination inpromotion. The link with the male domestic contribution is important inmoving to gender equality. As Esping-Andersen (2002: 124) argues,neither social nor labour market policies alone will produce suchequality; he identiﬁes the ‘admittedly weak feminization of the male lifecycle’ as a barrier to equal career opportunities in the Nordic countries.Structures of Gendered DiscriminationWomen in Turkey face further structures of gendered discrimination, yetthe perception of gendered disadvantage was not high among our respon-dents. When asked about barriers that they faced as academic workers,there was, however, a gendered variation. Many male professors claimedto have faced no disadvantages or barriers, but a few identiﬁed insti-tutional constraints in the promotion procedures. While many femaleprofessors argued that they had not experienced personal barriers to theircareer development, some did identify barriers to their career advance-ment, such as lack of support from family and friends, undergoing adivorce, having a child with a disability, and administrative obstructions.In general, while men tended to perceive institutional constraints, womenwere more likely to perceive familial constraints. One female professorsuggested that men have inherited advantages in social life which spillover into academic life: ‘I think that women’s success is not easilyaccepted by women and men . . . Men are performing their professionalduties more independently compared to women. They are alreadyconditioned to be successful in academic and social life’.Some male professors accepted that there is gender discrimination inworking life, but not in academic life. The belief in the high prestige andreputation of the profession conceals some inequalities, implying aperceived superiority and lack of discrimination in the academicprofession. As one commented, ‘gender discrimination is not a signiﬁcantissue here [in the university] and being men or women is beyond questionin an academic institution’. The underpinning assumption is that thesocially privileged position of academic workers in Turkey, particularly25808_053966_Healy (ds) 25/5/05 1:23 pm Page 259Healy et al.: Academic Employment and Genderfull professors, must give them some degree of immunity from discrimi-nation: ‘I do not believe in discrimination in this profession. Women facediscrimination in lots of other sectors but not in the university system’.The issue of gender discrimination is almost invisible to male professors,who are mostly very certain that there is no sex discrimination inuniversity or academic life. ‘There are no barriers to women in Turkey inthis area. I’ve never encountered it even in the most conservative places.Male colleagues also do support them [women]’.The belief in the equitable ideal of employment recurs in other Turkishstudies, for example of universities (Özkanli and Korkmaz, 2000: 65) andbanking (Özbilgin and Woodward, 2003). This belief is, nevertheless,often accompanied by the view that women academics should work morethan men in order to achieve career success. However, this view was notuniversally shared by women: as one respondent insisted, ‘all the discrim-inatory factors that exist in social life prevail in academic life as well’.Discussion and ConclusionsMischau (2001: 25) has remarked that ‘there is no university where thepercentage of female professors corresponds with the percentage offemale academic staff or students’. While Turkish women’s progress inacademia seems greater than their European counterparts, this success isnot underpinned by a critical mass of women academics nor by wide-spread labour market activity by women. It is evident that stronghistorical and national forces have been the main incentive for educatedwomen to contribute to the modernization of Turkey; whereas inEurope, the major impetus has come from legislation designed to combatthe negative effects of discrimination.We have concentrated on Turkey, but we recognize that some of thecharacteristics identiﬁed for Turkey may be shared with other Europeancountries, notable those in the CEE. What distinguishes Turkey is thecontradiction between women’s low labour market participation andtheir success in the professions, which seems counter-intuitive to thewestern eye. Most western commentators seek remedial measures forgendered discrimination in the strengthening of legislation. For Turkey,this class of women beneﬁted not from legislation, but from a strong stateideology of equality. This ‘state feminism’ resulted from the rupture withthe Ottoman Empire in 1923. Thus revolutionary change transformed thelives of middle-class women.Academic women felt the impact of this transformation. At the insti-tutional level, it was underpinned with the introduction of YÖK: thetransparency of its employment policies has facilitated women’s progress.This transparency is continually sought by feminists in universities in25908_053966_Healy (ds) 25/5/05 1:23 pm Page 260European Journal of Industrial Relations 11(2)Europe and North America, but often with at best partial success. Never-theless, to make an obvious point, for women to achieve hierarchicalsuccess in an occupation, they must take jobs from men or must beneﬁtdisproportionately from an increase in employment opportunities forboth. Part of the cumulative explanation of women’s success in Turkishacademia could be the exodus of men from the profession, consistentwith the interpretation by Reskin and Roos (1990) of the feminization ofsome North American occupations. Given Turkey’s comparatively lowlevel of academic pay and the associated view that academic work is nolonger attractive for men, this argument might seem persuasive. However,Eurostat data do not support this interpretation: academic salaries inTurkey, in terms of purchasing power, are not lower than those in coun-tries with a far lower proportion of women academics. It is the expan-sion of the university sector that has provided new opportunities for bothwomen and men.Nevertheless, Turkish women face severe career constraints. A strongfamily ideology continues to result in the underemployment of womenwith tertiary education. At the same time, the family can have contradic-tory functions: our study demonstrates its importance in enabling andfacilitating women to develop their academic careers. The women pro-fessors also demonstrated that they used the degrees of freedom availableto develop their careers and allow their ‘choices’ to become a reality.Their constrained agency was accepted within the societal context, and itappeared that the support they received was conditional on respecting thebounds of the family ideology.Esping-Andersen (2002) argues that there exists a broad consensus onwhat constitutes women-friendly policy. It includes affordable day care,paid maternity and parental leave, a right to leave when children are ill,and the ability to match work with school hours. But he adds that this isnot sufﬁcient: there is a need to change both gendered choices andsocietal constraints, including an inducement to men to embrace a more‘feminine’ life cycle. Unlike Turkey (and also many CEE countries),Denmark has some of the best ‘packages’ of equality beneﬁts, and itsfemale employment rate nearly matches that of men’s; yet women’s shareof academic employment, in particular at professorial level, is well belowthe European average.The continued hierarchical achievement of women in Turkish academiais under threat at different levels. There is a weakening of the dominantstate ideology; greater liberalization in higher education may lead to more‘ﬂexibility’ and less transparency. Our study indicates the importance offamily; however, balancing work and family roles is also contingent onﬁnancial resources to support help with household and childcare tasks.Family is both a constraint and an enabler; in this there are bothcommonalities as well as national particularities across Europe.26008_053966_Healy (ds) 25/5/05 1:23 pm Page 261Healy et al.: Academic Employment and GenderOur study of Turkey is important in the context of the ‘New Europe’,since it demonstrates the importance of state ideology in promotinggender equality. The explanation of Turkish women’s academic success ismultilayered and lies in the cumulative and interrelated effect of statepolicy, institutional transparency, increased labour demand, thehome–work interface, and the agency of the professors themselves. Thisexample is, nevertheless, not typical of Turkish women’s labour marketexperience, and it should be emphasized that this article draws on theexperience of a highly educated and privileged elite. This does not negatethe importance of their experience; after all, it is such women who are atthe centre of debates on vertical segregation in the countries of Europe.The Turkish example suggests that the legislatively focused Europeanapproach to equality, which Turkey is now adopting as part of its candi-dacy for EU membership, is necessary, but not sufﬁcient to achievegender equality.NOTES1 See, for example, in the United Kingdom, Bett (1999), Ledwith andManfredi (2000), Farish et al.
