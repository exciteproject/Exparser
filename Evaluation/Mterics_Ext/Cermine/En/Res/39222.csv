Fatherhood in the Context of Migration:An Intergenerational Approach1Julia BrannenAbstractThis paper examines fatherhood from an intergenerational perspective, focussing onmen who grew up in very different societies namely Ireland and Britain and who werefathers in two different historical periods; an older generation who came to the UKfrom Ireland between the 1940s and 1960s, and their adult sons who were born in theUK in the 1970s and who also became fathers of sons. It analyses the context of mi-gration, and its implications for continuity and change across the generations in rela-tion to social mobility and models of fatherhood and demonstrates how a strong workethic and the cultural resources of religion and Irish ethnicity are transmitted to thenext male generation. The data are drawn from a British study in which thirty genera-tional chains of men were interviewed. The study adopted a biographical approach. Inthe context of this wider data set and particularly that from the Irish families the expe-riences of one Irish family are used to illustrate the transmission processes involved.In the family discussed, the cultural resources of an ambitious Irish mother and thestrong work ethic of both parents produce upward occupational mobility in the secondgeneration. The higher occupational status of the father is however played out via amale breadwinner model of fatherhood in which the father, like his own father, isdriven by work.Vaterschaft im Kontext von Migration: Ein intergenerationaler AnsatzZusammenfassungDer Artikel untersucht Vaterschaftspraktiken unter einer intergenerationalen Perspek-tive.

The lives of the oldergeneration, referred to henceforth as the grandfathers, were shaped by the disruptionsand circumstances associated with being an Irish migrant between 1940 and 1960while for the younger generation – the fathers – fatherhood was played out in the1990s and 2000s. The data are drawn from a British study in which thirty generationalchains of men were interviewed: eight chains of first generation Polish (migrant)fathers, their fathers (living in Poland), and their sons (plus two chains of secondgeneration Polish fathers); ten chains of second generation Irish fathers, their fathers(born in Ireland) and their sons; ten chains of white British fathers, their fathers (bornin the UK) and their sons who were aged 5-18. The study adopted a biographicalapproach.2 The article focuses on one intergenerational chain. Firstly, it outlines theapproach to the study and briefly puts the migration of the Irish migrant grandfathersin context. Secondly, it compares the life courses of the two generations and the socialand economic conditions in which the lives of the grandfathers and fathers unfold.Thirdly, it explores men’s accounts of transmission. Finally, it discusses the ways inwhich the experience of migration from a poor rural society plays out in the lives ofthe second generation of fathers leading to upward social mobility. It shows how pastfamily history is incorporated into family identity in a different structural context.Despite their upward occupational mobility fathers reproduce similarities in fatheringpractices to those of their own fathers and retain an Irish identity while putting theirown mark upon their identity.ApproachesThe study adopts a life course perspective (Elder/Johnson/Crosnoe 2006; Elder/Giele2009) in order to understand the experience of fatherhood in the context of the societythey live in (the history-biography connection, see Mills 1959). A life course ap-proach examines change and continuity over time in individual behaviour across awhole range of life domains highlighting turning points (Denzin 1989) or shifts ofdirection. However, knowledge is not only sought at the individual level (Bertaux1997; Bertaux/Thompson 1997); individual accounts are interpretations set within asocial context of factual events (Bertaux 1997). Life stories add nuance to understand-ing the collectivity of the group situating lives in their social and historical contexts.In a study applying a generational lens, it is possible to explore how a group com-pares with an historical cohort linked by particular experiences, as in the case of Irishmigrants, and the resources for fatherhood that are transmitted intergenerationally. AsMannheim (1952) suggests, generational time is not only about individuals occupying2 The Biographic-interpretive Narrative Interviewing Method (Wengraf 2001) was employed and adaptedfor the grandfathers’ and fathers’ interviews. In the first part of the interview, the informants were invit-ed to give a life story. In the second part, they were encouraged to elaborate on salientevents/experiences selected by the interviewer from their initial narratives. Using a semi-structured ap-proach, the interviewers then asked about specific issues if they were already covered. The analysis in-volved an initial separation of the life histories from the interpretive accounts (Wengraf 2001). Atten-tion was given to the narrative context including the interview encounter and present time frames(Brannen/Moss/Mooney 2004).270Julia Brannena similar historical location, it is also about the creation of collective cultures throughwhich continuities and discontinuities are transmitted intergenerationally. Culturesexpress the tensions between synchronic and diachronic dimensions of ‘linked lives’(Elder/Johnson/Crosnoe 2006); how individuals make connections with others hori-zontally on the basis of belonging to the same age cohort while also relating to othergenerations across historical time (Mannheim 1952). The fact of belonging to a dif-ferent historical location has consequences for the experience of being fathered andthe parenting of children. As Mannheim (1952) argues, the formative years of child-hood and youth are critical in the shaping of common identities, albeit the sameevents may not impinge on individuals and groups in the same ways. In experientialterms generations hold “divided memories” (Giesen 2004, 22) so that memories ofdifferent pasts shape perceptions of the present and the future.Transmission between family and historical generations varies according to thefield in which generational processes occur (Kohli 1999). As emphasised by Bourdieu(1990), the social context in which the idea of a “generation” becomes meaningful ispivotal. Thus intergenerational ambivalences may be stronger in relation to disciplin-ing children but weaker in promoting educational success. However, what passesbetween generations in families, or is passed on, is often taken for granted sincetransmission is what people do and is embedded in routine everyday practices andrelationships (Morgan 1999). The transmission of family resources and cultures canbe implicit as well as explicit (Bernstein 1996). The notion of “family habitus”(Bourdieu 1990) denotes a set of dispositions related to particular practices whichmay lead to regularities in patterns of transmission across family generations (ibid.). Itmay involve “reasonable or common-sense behaviour” – forms of “spontaneity with-out consciousness”, carried out without reflection or fuss by people who are operatingaccording to a “practical logic”, an embodied “feel for the game” rather than an ex-plicit plan or strategy (Bourdieu 1975). In the sense that habitus involves “produc[ing]history on the basis of history”, dispositions can be cumulative (ibid., 56) and hencebecome evident in an intergenerational study (Brannen 2006). Habitus demonstratesboth the “principle of both continuity and discontinuity” (Wacquant 2008, 267).Material and cultural transmission also creates, reproduces and transmits familyidentities. However identities change over the life course and over generations asfamily members seek to differentiate themselves from one another; that which istransmitted alters as each generation makes its own mark upon what has been passedon to it (Bertaux/Bertaux-Wiame 1997). A greater investment in the transmission ofidentity is typically evident among those who fear the loss of cultural identity, as inthe case of migrants (Delcroix 2000). In this process ambivalences are created as anew generation does better educationally than the parent generation generating newclass positions, dispositions and habits which may distance them from the parentgeneration.Intergenerational transmission involves the transfer of material resources and ser-vices, aspirations, values, practices, social learning, and models of parent-child rela-tions (Bengston/Biblarz/Roberts 2002). Parents’ socio-economic status and genderplay a key role in the transmission of values and aspirations through the internaliza-tion of parents’ outlooks on and interests in life (ibid.), through communication prac-tices (Bernstein 2000), through investments in children’s human capital (Bourdieu1986; 1990; Vincent/Ball 2006). Children may also seek to be similar or differentiateFatherhood in the Context of Migration: An Intergenerational Approach271themselves through habitual, bodily and visual forms of (dis)identification (Mason2008). Gender (dis)identification is especially pertinent affecting the emotional quali-ty of parent-child relationships at particular life course phases.The context of Irish migrationIreland was a colony of Britain until 1922 when all but its six northern countiesachieved independence as the Irish Free State which went on to re-name itself Irelandin 1937 and declared itself a republic in 1949. For most of its modern history Irelandhas been a poor and rural society with a strong pattern of out migration. In the after-math of independence it withdrew into itself both economically and culturally and itspost-independence failure to develop accelerated rather than stemmed this migrationpattern (Garvin 2004). From the 1860s to the 1960s Ireland was Britain’s main sourceof reserve labour (Ryan 2004).3 The 1950s and 1960s saw the largest outflow of peo-ple from Ireland to the UK (Garvey 1985).4 Moreover, through Ireland’s history ofclose contact with the modern industrial economies of the United States and Britain,migration was part of Irish culture. In the West of Ireland where the land was poorand migration heaviest, migration was part of a growing consciousness of alternativefutures. People lost confidence in their own culture and were increasingly influencedby the market and material cultures of the large capitalist economies (Brody 1973).As well as seeking work, Irish migrants were attracted by the bright lights of the bigcities (Walter 1999). Most Irish migrants came from the countryside and lacked edu-cation and skills. In the years following independence most Irish children had nosecondary education and left school at 14; secondary education was not free until thelate 1960s (Garvin 2004). Coming from a rural society which had no welfare state, thenew migrants joined a very different society; they found work in big cities and in theconstruction industry (much of which was casualised and unregulated with high acci-dent rates), but they also had access for their children to free primary and secondaryeducation and other universal welfare benefits. Thereby they hoped to carve out abetter future for themselves and their families.The life course of the grandfathersAll but one of the ten grandfathers in the study migrated between 1940 and 1960, halffrom the West of Ireland. All but one had between four and nine siblings. For mostgrandfathers the transition to adulthood came early in the life course (Barrett 1999).They were expected to help support their families from an early age even when still atschool.Those who migrated were in the main young and single but, with one exception,too old to benefit from the post war free secondary education in the UK. Six grandfa-thers left school at 14. One grandfather (of middle class origin) entered secondaryeducation in Ireland and another who joined his migrant parents in England. Those3 This was the second main migration wave; the first occurred in the 1840s following the Potato Famine(Salt 2009, 56).4 Inflows into Britain were among younger people with the exception of the 1950s when the numberswere split between 25-34 and 15-24 groups (Barrett 1999). In the 1960s the age range at in migrationwidened.272Julia Brannenwho left school in Ireland went into menial, poorly paid jobs with no prospects. Allhad siblings or other relatives who had already migrated providing them withknowledge of job opportunities and some initial support in Britain. On arrival theyfound work in the construction industry, the archetypal source of employment forIrishmen in Britain, or in factories (Walter 1999). Several remained in the same occu-pation and sector all their lives. Several of the men returned to Ireland at least once totry to resettle but returned to Britain after only a short period. It was also not uncom-mon to send their children back to Ireland. In one case, a grandfather was left in Ire-land with his grandmother from the age of 8 to 14.As migrants, few recalled experiencing discrimination themselves but commentedon the widespread discrimination against Irish people that existed at the time (Hick-man/Walter 1997; Ryan 2004). From present vantage points most grandfathers con-structed in their interviews ‘transformative biographies’ (Phoenix 2008) – presentingthemselves as having made something of their lives in Britain, and so dis-identifyingwith the stereotypical portrait of Irishmen who fell on hard times (typically because ofthe ‘demon drink’). Proud of being Irish several said they were grateful to Britain forproviding them with “a good living”, that is from the perspective of Ireland’s impov-erishment at the time they migrated. By contrast their sons, from the perspective ofgreater current economic affluence (both in Ireland and Britain), reflected on thedifficulties their parents had faced as migrants in a particular historical period inwhich the Irish were strongly discriminated against for political reasons and on ac-count of their “otherness” (accent), their low economic status and willingness to dotough manual work.Despite feeling they had done “well” for themselves in Britain, only one grandfa-ther was upwardly occupationally mobile compared with his own father. GrandfatherO., whose father became a carpenter, qualified as a teacher. He was doubly advan-taged in that he arrived in Britain at an age when he was obliged to attend school andhe also joined his parents who by then were able to support him while he completedhis education. He recalled how as a newly qualified teacher he sought advancementbut was forced to teach in Catholic schools in inner cities. On one occasion he wentfor a teaching post in a private (public) school:I could sense that I was a little bit almost like a black man there you know. Icould sense there was definitely – these were the governors, these were blueTories – bloke like me (with Irish name) you know, bloody hell, you know.The transition to adulthood was marked by the disruption of family relationships, alack of qualifications, and the need to find their way in a new society hostile to mi-grants. This in turn shaped the transition to fatherhood. As migrants they were free tomarry in the sense that they were no longer tied to the land and by local customs.However, up to the 1960s, the percentage of the Irish population who was single in allthe younger age groups was the highest recorded in any developed country, particular-ly among men (Hannan 2008). Many Irish migrants never married. Six out of the tenIrish grandfathers became fathers in their mid-20s, early in the life course by Irishstandards (Hannan 2008). Because of factors to do with religion, marginalisation andghettoization in Irish communities, many Irish in Britain (all but one in the study)Fatherhood in the Context of Migration: An Intergenerational Approach273married Irish women whom they had met either in Irish dance halls in Britain or onvisits back home.Brought up in a strongly religious environment in Ireland, the lives of this genera-tion were dominated by the Roman Catholic Church. Fatherhood was therefore predi-cated on a Catholic culture influencing family planning and how they brought up theirchildren. Since the Church forbade the use of contraception, parenthood was expectedautomatically to follow marriage. Eight of the ten grandfathers had their first childwithin one year of marriage. However, compared with their families of origin thisgeneration had significantly fewer children; 3.2 children on average compared with6.6 in their families of origin.Decisions about when to marry were influenced by the need for men to provethemselves good workers. The work ethic was the defining feature of their identitiesand a major source of male pride:I love working. I don’t like hanging around to be quite honest. I think if I wasout of work I would feel terrible, I really would. (Grandfather G.)Being the main breadwinner in his family was “just a natural thing really you know”.Grandfather G. worked all over the country in his job and sometimes had to stay awayfrom home for weeks at a time. Especially when the children were young, he did notspend much time with his family:… used to work Saturday and Sunday … used to work as much overtime as Icould ... you know hard bringing a family up when you don’t have much mon-ey.Grandfather M. recalled having to work long hours labouring on the motorways. Withhindsight and in the context of taking part in a study of fathers he reflected that he didnot meet the current standards of fatherhood:At that time it was all about getting the money really to – put[ting] the food onthe table really ... and pay your mortgage. That’s really a big concern at thatstage.Grandfathers also experienced financial pressures to support their parents and theirsiblings back home, some continuing to do this over their working lives. Remittancesmay have influenced marriage decisions and the timing of marriage although nonemade this link.In deciding to marry (and hence to have a family) they had to find suitable hous-ing. Several described discrimination from landlords; they used to say at that time“No blacks, no dogs, no Irish.” Starting married life meant living in single rooms andsharing bathrooms. The two routes out of this situation were to be rehoused by thecouncil5 or to purchase run down housing and renovate it through drawing on theirown skills or the informal economy in the building industry. Since the grandfathers(and their wives) moved in Irish circles not only in the workplace but also in Irish5 Several later purchased their council houses under Thatcher’s ‘right to buy’ scheme in the 1980s.274Julia Brannencommunities, the Church and schools provided support for parenting. As one grandfa-ther noted: “Being part of that community is kind of home from home with all theattractions of a big city.”The life course of the fathersThe transition to adulthood for their sons born in the UK in the 1960s and 1970s wasvery different. While their fathers enjoyed a short period of youth, the fathers experi-enced an extended youth period which was marked by social if not financial inde-pendence – ‘young adulthood’ (Nilsen/das Dores Guerreiro/Brannen 2002). Thesemen’s memories of their childhood suggest security and stability even if money wasshort. Several recalled growing up in poor housing in Irish communities, and attend-ing Catholic schools where they met other second generation Irish. They also fondlyrecalled annual pilgrimages made with their families to Ireland in the holidays.The fathers benefited from better educational opportunities; they left school muchlater than their fathers – all but one beyond the minimum school leaving age of 16.All gained some qualifications and six a university degree. As a consequence, theyattained higher status jobs as the research evidence on second generation Irish inBritain also suggests.6 Only one started in a manual job (in the construction industry)but rose to a management position and gained some qualifications. The two fatherswhose fathers were in middle class professional jobs entered even more prestigiousprofessions.7The transition to fatherhood of the second generation differs also. In all but onecase the fathers married at an older age compared with their fathers. Also most fathersexperienced a longer period between marriage and fatherhood than their own fathers(two or more years following marriage compared with only one year for their fathers).Like their fathers, most married Irish women and because of their religious back-grounds most brought up their children as Roman Catholics and sent them to Catholicschools.In order to examine the processes underlying these generational shifts we now turnto analyse the “case” of a grandfather, father and son. This case is typical in manyrespects of the Irish chains of grandfathers and fathers studied (with the exception ofthe middle class origin grandfather). It is however less typical in terms of the partplayed by the grandmother.Life course comparisonsGrandfather Seamas was born in the 1940s in the West of Ireland on a small farm, thesecond of six children. The family lived in one room of a two roomed cottage. Sea-mas’ parents had worked in England but returned to Ireland during World War II.Seamas was seven when his mother died, leaving his father to raise six children, in-cluding two toddlers and a baby. An unmarried relative was asked to come back from6 Longitudinal Study data of 1971-81-91 (Walter 1999) shows unusually high rates of upward mobilityfor second generation Irish, especially those with two Irish-born parents.7 Despite social mobility considerable health disadvantage is reported for second generation Irish as forfirst generation that is compared with white British (Williams/Ecob 1999). Harding and Balarajan(1996) found health disadvantage to be unrelated to social class. However, little is known about thosesecond generation who do not identify as Irish.Fatherhood in the Context of Migration: An Intergenerational Approach275England to care for them.8 Aged nine, Seamas’ father left for England to work, re-turning for visits once or twice a year. Seamas had few memories of his father: “Itwas a hard, hard life, now I tell you.”Seamas did not remember missing him; he had never seen much of him and any-way everyone was in the same boat, “that’s just the way it was”. He remembered nosocial life, no activities other than occasional games of cards on visits to kin.Seamas’ life course is typical of the first generation Irish. His transition to adult-hood came early. When Seamas was 13 his older brother left for England to find workand a year later when he was 14 Seamas had to leave school. He helped run the farmand did various odd jobs. Aged 17, Seamas went to England with a friend to look forwork. He worked on various large construction projects all over the country but basedhimself in London. Some years later he bought a road making machine and becameself-employed. Intending initially to return to Ireland he got used to the “good mon-ey”. Moreover, his family back in Ireland depended on his remittances.Aged 23, he married an Irish girl he met at an Irish dance hall in London. He wasmaking good money in the construction industry but was not yet on the housing lad-der. First, the couple lived in a rented room sharing the house with several Irish fami-lies. Their first child was born there when Seamas was 24. After five years and asecond child the couple had saved enough money to put down a deposit on a large rundown property. By this time Seamas’ wife who was business minded was workingpart time. Later, she set up her own building company, which was atypical both forher time and compared with the other cases. This did not influence Seamas’ view ofhimself as the family breadwinner, albeit it meant the family was relatively well off asa consequence. The couple refurbished the property with help from family and friendsover several years. Work remained at the centre of Seamas’ identity; he worked longhours, often seven days a week, with periods away from home. He was still workingat the time we interviewed him. From his current vantage point, his definition of a“good father” has an old fashioned ring to it:… suppose, make sure they’re provided and that they have everything theywant and looked after. That they get good schooling and ... they’re well rearedand looked after I suppose. They’re clean and kept well.Seamas was proud of being a provider:They have been to every country nearly in the world, you know what I mean,around with school holidays and with trips and things that (inaudible) I nevereven heard of, you know.It was his wife, he said, who had influenced the children’s aspirations and careerchoices and been the disciplinarian. Seamas positioned himself as “the easy one”.Compare this life course trajectory with that of Seamas’ son, Willie. Willie, thesecond of two children, was born in the 1970s. He attended the local Catholic primaryschool along with many Irish origin children. On the advice of his mother’s friend, hewent to a “good” Catholic secondary school some distance from home and studied8 The female relative never married.276Julia Brannensubjects compatible with his career choice in banking. Unlike his father, Willie expe-rienced a “long period of youth”. At 18 he went to university. He enjoyed considera-ble upward mobility through entry to the finance industry which was booming at thetime (the 1990s); he joined an Irish bank, drawing on the social capital of his Irishheritage. There he met his wife to be, also of Irish origin.Aged 29, the couple married and two years later their son was born (eight at inter-view). Two more children followed. Willie became a father later in the life coursethan his father and under much more favourable material conditions. By then, withtwo incomes from a well-paid industry, they had already bought their own house.Like his father, Willie’s life was driven by work. He too worked very long hours andwas often away from home and so lacked time for his children. However, despite thefact that Willie had a university education and was in a management job, he and hisfamily continued to live within a stone’s throw of his parents where Willie had grownup. He also sent his children to his former Catholic primary school.The accounts of the two men mirror one another. Seamas said that communicationbetween them was limited when Willie was a child mainly because he (Seamas) wasalways working, a pattern which continued into adulthood. Like Seamas, Willie didnot recall his father spending much time with his father as a child: “he was neverthere”, noting the similarities with his own fathering: “they’ll be in bed by the timeI’m home.” Willie’s memory of his relationship with his father while he was growingup confirmed his father’s account – “non-confrontational” and sticking to “nice easysoft subjects which remains the case now”. Willie confirmed that his mother was thedriving force in his life: “Dad didn’t have a clue the school even existed.”Both, father and son described living in different worlds on account of their workand interests, using the same words. Seamas referred obliquely to differences in theireducation and occupations “you know we’re in different worlds, kind of thing now”while Willie noted:… it was totally different to the world they came from – so they’re (parents)both in construction. I went into the financial industry and um, I’m sure nomore than I didn’t know what they did – to a technical level they don’t have aclue what I do.While there are similarities in terms of their unavailability as fathers, Willie also sub-scribed to some aspects of a modern discourse of “fathering” (Brannen/Nilsen 2006) –in particular relational aspects such as communication, openness and closeness (Der-mott 2008), while accepting that his fatherhood practice was confined to breadwin-ning and involved little childcare and spending time with his children only at week-ends.I honestly think there’s more of a conscious effort for the father [today] tohave more one to one time with the children than previously and probably getmore engaged in what the children are up to and how they’re developing.Willie considered himself “slightly more engaged” with his first born than his fatherwas with him at the same age, for example knowing more about his son’s school andfriends. At the same time, he suggested a similar segregation of marital roles for hisFatherhood in the Context of Migration: An Intergenerational Approach277own and his parents’ marriage. He was however somewhat ambivalent about greaterfather involvement, as were some other strongly work-focussed fathers of this genera-tion.While Willie spent little time with his children except at weekends, because ofgreater affluence and his particular skills he engaged in a wider range of activities(computers, physical activities and taking them out) with his children than his ownfather had done with him. But unlike his father he was more educationally ambitiousfor his children and thought he was stricter with them. However, it was his wife whohelped with the children’s homework.Transmission between fathers and sonsPossible explanations for Willie’s rejection of modern fatherhood practice (though notits ideology) and his defence of a traditional male breadwinner role include the lifecourse experience shaped by his family history of migration which created a need tobuild a better life for himself and his family. A further clue lies in the cultural sphereof ‘family identity’ (as part of family memory) which is marked in this family bystrong continuities. Given that original identities play a pivotal role in constructingbiographical continuities, it is significant that Willie did not break with religious tradi-tion, that he married into an Irish family, that he still felt Irish, and that he stayedgeographically close to his parents.The transmission of identity is however habitual and not necessarily open to re-flection, as may be seen in the way Seamas responded to questions relating to trans-mission in the interview. Seamas could not think what he had inherited from his fathernor how he had influenced Willie except that he wanted a better life for him, just ashis had been better than his father’s.I didn’t want him to go out working like (inaudible) you know what I meanworking. It was great, he had school, he had a good childhood, you know whatI mean.However, Seamas pointed to aspects of identification, claiming his children and theirfamilies as Irish:They’re all Irish, they’ve always you know (pause) they’ve always been roundwith Irish and their friends here are Irish or Irish descent.Seamas also asserted their similar tastes describing how father and son both enjoyed apint and watching Gaelic football together. Also striking is the fact that Willie contin-ues to live near his parents in the same, now gentrified, community where he grew up.But despite this communication between father and son was limited. Seamas com-mented, emphasising the value he attached to ‘long hours’:We don’t really, we don’t communicate much better now, no. Well I don’t seehim to be honest, he’s always – you know we’re in different worlds, kind ofthing now … but I mean he does his own thing. He works good long hours ac-tually.278Julia BrannenOn the other hand, living so close Seamas helped Willie and his family with practicalmatters. For their part, both, his son and his grandsons helped Seamas with comput-ers. Moreover, close contact between the female generations was maintained.Similarly, Willie suggested strong themes of Irish identity. He holds an Irish pass-port and counted himself as Irish while at the same time integrating country of birthand residence into his identity:Depends if it’s convenient to be one or t’other. Um, yeah I would see myself asIrish. But it depends on who it’s going to annoy most typically.He remained a Catholic and a church goer, if an infrequent one. Willie gave a richaccount of the mainly cultural capital passed on both by his parents, referring to theirstrong work ethic which he also wanted for his children. Like his father he spoke offamily resemblances (Mason 2008), noting his delight at having been stopped in thestreet by someone remarking on his own son’s resemblance to his grandfather. Healso felt that he had inherited his father’s social skills (“social demeanour”) and heidentified with his father’s equal treatment of others:I don’t give two hoots if you earn two grand a year or two million quid a year.I will treat you exactly the same. I think that’s a big thing I’ve probably gotfrom him (pause) and then to a degree socialising in places that serve alcoholis probably another major thing.Among others, Willie saw his parents as role models for his children:... between us spending hundreds of hours a week with them (Mm) um, by theway you act, by the way you talk – the views you have – how you encouragethem to discuss their views and develop their views – all of that will have ahuge consequence on them probably.At the same time, he stressed that his parents did not intervene in areas such as reli-gious upbringing or education.For his part Willie said he had no fixed ambitions for his sons; he would like togive them financial stability without handing everything to them on a plate. To someextent his easy-going attitude is like his father’s:My level of empathy is you know short of having a limb hanging off, you know,I’m not really worried about what happens to you, because it’ll be all righttomorrow ... (wife) thinks I’m an emotional retard.Reflecting at the end of the interview, Willie showed his awareness of the historicalcontext which created discontinuity between his own life and that of his father. Hisnarrative demonstrates a detailed understanding of what it meant for men like hisfather to migrate at that time, while he positions himself and his son in a very differ-ent world:Fatherhood in the Context of Migration: An Intergenerational Approach279To my mind I was brought up in a totally different economic environment to myparents. I could not dream of leaving home at 13, by myself, going to foreigncountry, finding work maybe through friends and neighbours, full time work-ing, living in a room with two or three others who I may or may not know, andknowing that there’s no cheap Ryanair flight home … it’s a totally, totally dif-ferent world, you know. I think for both of them there was a lack of education,formal education. Neither of them are stupid by a long shot, but you know tomy mind I was brought up in a totally different world to the world they camefrom and the world they experienced, especially from like the ages of twelve,thirteen onwards … and I don’t know if this changes from generation to gen-eration, but I just don’t see that same leap happening between the childhood Ihad and the childhood my kids are having.Interestingly, Willie’s eight year old son, Michael, expressed some resistance to hisfather’s practices. He said he did not want the same kind of job and thought his fatherhad to work too hard and too long hours.... because sometimes he’s in a meeting and when there’s an argument thensometimes he isn’t back till like two, three (in the morning) … which I get real-ly annoyed with.Michael gave a consistent and graphic account which confirmed what he saw to bethe negative impact of his father’s work on family life. In response to one of the inter-view activity sheets concerning “Time with my dad”, Michael ticked the box “I wouldlike more time” and wrote down next to it very carefully “because I do not get to seehim often because he is at work”. Asked to complete the sentence “I like my dadwhen – ”, Michael said cautiously: “When he (pause) when (pause) when he’s homefrom work early. I don’t when he’s not home early.” He talked about having to packin lots of things over the recent bank holiday as his dad had to go to work the nextday. Michael also commented on the household’s gendered division of labour. Askedabout who did which activities in the home, he ticked few done by his father and wasrather critical of this, suggesting his father needed more practice, especially withcooking.There are also discontinuities here in ethnic identification in the third generation.When Michael was asked “Where do you say you are from if someone asks you?” hewas disdainful about being asked such “nosy questions” but said that since he sound-ed English he would say “English”. However, at the same time, he was clearly wellaware of his Irish connections.DiscussionThis paper has examined how historical circumstances and the migration experienceof first generation Irish grandfathers created discontinuity in the second generation offathers in relation to education and occupation. The case of an Irish grandfather andson shows how the structural contexts of migration and countries of origin and inmigration play out over time and in family memory. Compared with their workingclass counterparts in our study (Brannen/Mooney/Wigfall 2011) the migration experi-280Julia Brannenence of the Irish grandfathers put them initially at great material and cultural disad-vantage in Britain: earlier transition to adulthood, less education, no qualifications,less material or other support as young single men in Britain, concentration in a dan-gerous industry, and the experience of discrimination. For religious reasons, the tran-sition to parenthood followed closely on the heels of marriage and, because of dis-crimination, was accompanied by difficulties finding suitable family housing. Asmain breadwinners in their households, they described themselves as “absent fathers”,a view influenced by their consciousness of present day normative discourses of “in-volved fatherhood”. Moreover this pattern of fathering was sustained by a gendereddivision of labour in which mothers ran the households and did most of the child care.Unable to help with their children’s academic studies because of their own lack ofeducation, grandfathers looked to Catholic schools and religion to help them bring uptheir children “properly”. On the other hand, because of their origins in a very poorrural society they defined themselves in terms of a very strong male breadwinnerwork ethic.However, grandfathers did not pass on their own disadvantages to their sons butgave them stable if not materially well endowed childhoods. In Willie’s case, as in theother Irish cases, the spur to work hard was transmitted to the fathers through theirparents while encouragement to succeed in education came largely from their moth-ers, especially in Willie’s case. The institutional context of Roman Catholic schoolswas a further important feature which facilitated their educational success. Circum-scribed by their Irish families, communities and religious schools, the changed histor-ical context and institutional fabric in which sons grew up facilitated a different lifecourse pattern, enabling them to attain qualifications, and in the longer term highstatus professional or managerial jobs (with one exception). This in turn led to latertransitions to fatherhood by which time fathers were established on housing ladders.9However, despite their upward occupational mobility, the fathers (with the sameone exception) practiced fatherhood in a way not dissimilar from that of their fathers,involving little responsibility or “hands on” caring for children. They were either soleor main breadwinners in their households although, according to the discourse ofgender equality, they did not see this as important. Like their fathers, because of longworking hours they had limited time for family life, a pattern reinforced by the com-mitment of mothers in caring for children and also by a degree of precariousness incurrent labour markets. While the two contexts of employment differed, both malegenerations experienced insecurity. The grandfathers were employed in the 1960s and1970s in the construction industry large parts of which were casual with little unioni-sation or regulation (Clegg 1979 passim) while the fathers, employed in the 1990s and2000s, experienced widespread deregulation of the UK economy, bringing job insecu-rity and work intensification into many higher status jobs (Lewis/Brannen/Nilsen2009). However the fathers’ higher educational level and income provided them withmany more opportunities which protected them in the context of unemployment.As discussed elsewhere (Brannen/Nilsen 2006), structural context and change infatherhood practices are configured differently for different social classes. Commonlymiddle class fathers today embrace the “new fathering” discourse of father involve-9 Since the 1980s, when the public housing stock shrank under Thatcherism and when council tenantswere given “the right to buy”, people aspired to buy their homes.Fatherhood in the Context of Migration: An Intergenerational Approach281ment and relationality (see for example Dermott 2008). So, too, the second generationIrish fathers subscribed to this normative discourse. As in the case of middle classWillie whose time at home was heavily constrained by his career, his upward occupa-tional mobility was not accompanied by significant changes in his fatherhood prac-tice. Only one second generation Irish father, a lone parent, shared the care of his twochildren on an equal basis (with his ex-wife). Significantly he was in a low status(administrative) job. In this case a succession of life course events led to a differenttrajectory; a failure to fulfil his academic potential despite having gained some passesin the General Certificate of Secondary Education examination which is taken at 1610;a move away from Catholicism in adolescence; marriage outside the Irish community;and difficulty developing a career. A decisive turning point was the break-up of hismarriage at which time he was faced with a critical decision namely to share the careof his children and not to prioritise work.The upward occupational mobility of the second generation raises questions abouthow the families managed the structural ambivalence (Luescher 2005) between thegenerations. In Willie’s case, as in all but one of the Irish cases, as a son of a migrantit was the transmission of a will to succeed in education and the workplace whichappears to have been significant in reproducing particular fatherhood practices.Structural ambivalence is also mediated via the transmission of cultural resourceswhich form part of the migrant family heritage in particular through the persistence ofa strong sense of Irish identity. Like Willie, the fathers’ “Irishness” was sustained intheir childhoods through growing up in Irish communities in the UK and annual pil-grimages made with parents to Ireland in the summer holidays. Irish identity alsocontinued to be closely entwined with religious identity (Bruce et al. 2004, 13) but didnot preclude identification with Britain. Irish identity was transmitted between fathersand sons sometimes through passing on Irish names; and importantly via culturalperformance such as going to church and cultural centres some of which pertained toparticular forms of masculinity; having “a pint” together at the pub, watching andplaying particular Gaelic sports, a mutual interest in Irish music. The two generationsalso pointed to the transmission of gendered family dispositions and resemblancesmanifest in references to similar appearance, character and manner, propensities forsociability and competence in “talking the talk” (an iconic Irish characteristic), as inthe case of Seamas and Willie. These forms of transmitted cultural capital are themeans by which Irish male generations created a shared history in the context of themigration experience.At the same time, as in Willie’s case, structural ambivalences of social mobilitywere not entirely reconciled at a personal level. Willie constructed his world as verydifferent from that of his migrant father, while also being conscious that this was partof his heritage. There were therefore clear differences between the generations in aMannheimian sense. The second generation viewed their parents as members of aparticular generation which was shaped both by the harshness of their early lives inIreland and by their experiences as migrants in a hostile society in which they had towork very hard “to get by” – issues which few of the older generation were willing todwell upon in their interviews. In that sense migration was a clear generational mark-10 Pupils took these examinations at 16 and many left school at this stage.282Julia Brannener for the Irish grandfathers while the more linear life course of their sons was shapedby the pursuit of achievement and material progress.LITERATURE<ref>Barrett, Alan (1999): Irish Migration: Characteristics, Causes and Consequences, IZA Discus-</ref>sion Paper no. 97, Bonn.<ref>Bengtson, Vern L., Timothy J.
