It allows us to examine the present state of this ﬁeld and to identifysome areas that remain under-researched and even neglected in currentresearch agendas. In and of itself, any study that so forcefully and convinc-ingly confronts the conventional wisdom that the European Parliament (EP)is an ineffectual, irrelevant institution deserves a wide readership. However,this book represents much more than simply a study of legislative behaviourin the only directly elected European Union (EU) institution. It addressesmuch larger questions about the origins of political parties and party disci-pline, the nature of party competition and the potential for representativedemocracy in a complex political environment. This book will be of interestnot just to those immersed in the political system of the EP but also to partyscholars and legislative watchers more generally and indeed even to demo-cratic theorists concerned about the possibility for representative democracyin the EU.The ﬁeld of legislative politics has long been dominated by studies of theUnited States Congress. This congressional research has generated a remark-able body of scholarship, which has remained largely untested beyond thecongressional experience for too long. In the past decade however, there hasbeen a conscious and concerted effort on the part of EP scholars, led in no4 3 34 3 4European Union Politics 8(3)small part by the authors of this book, to extend these theories into a com-parative context. This book represents a very deliberate effort to connectlegislative studies of the European Parliament to this wider body of literatureand to shake off the mantle of the ‘sui generis’ approach that has frequentlyand regrettably governed EU studies.The overarching argument running through this book is that politicalgroups in the European Parliament have become fully institutionalized; theydominate decision-making and are very similar animals to their nationalcounterparts. The bulk of the book is dedicated to demonstrating that thepolitical groups have become increasingly cohesive over time and that politicsin the Parliament has been ‘normalized’, in that party competition is alongideological rather than territorial dimensions. An impressive amount of data,both quantitative and qualitative, is marshalled to convincingly demonstratethe validity of these arguments, and the book’s contribution to legislativestudies and EU politics is indisputable. The book combines theoretical rigourwith equally rigorous and systematic testing of the main hypotheses and itgreatly enriches and advances our understanding of the political dynamicsthat operate within the European Parliament.The ﬁrst three chapters of the book present the theoretical framework forthe analysis that follows. Chapter three in particular deserves close reading; itis here that the main theoretical argument is developed. The authors theorizethat, contrary to conventional wisdom, we should not expect to observe terri-torial politics in action in the European Parliament. They hypothesize thatterritorial conﬂicts are devolved to lower levels of decision-making within afederal structure where they can be resolved most efﬁciently. However, certainconﬂicts (particularly economic ones) generate inefﬁciencies if resolved at theterritorial level and that power in these policy areas is best retained at thefederal level. The theory thus predicts that party competition should be alongideological dimensions within federal chambers and the remainder of the bookis concerned with ﬁnding conﬁrmatory evidence to this effect. Chapters fourand ﬁve present empirical evidence that participation rates in voting haveincreased over time and that cohesion has risen concomitantly with theincreasing powers of the Parliament itself. Chapter six examines whether ornot political group control of the agenda is sufﬁcient to enforce party disci-pline. Chapter seven considers the tension that may come to bear on membersof the European Parliament (MEPs) when there is a conﬂict of interestsbetween their national party and their EP political group. Chapters eightand nine examine the ideological structure of political competition in the EP,with the former focusing on coalition formation and the latter on the dimen-sionality of the policy space that is evident in voting behaviour. The ﬁnal twochapters provide detailed and rich case studies of recent controversial andMcElroy Legislative Politics as Normal?4 3 5high-stake votes, the ‘sacking’ of the Santer Commission and the takeoverdirective, to complement the analysis in chapters four to nine. One could dwellin detail on the many merits of this ﬁne book, but the achievements of theauthors will be obvious to any reader and summarizing them thus seemsredundant. Therefore it is more productive to explore in the remainder of thisforum piece some of the analytical issues this book raises and the questionsand challenges it poses for legislative scholars and students of the EP inparticular.Roll call votesThe study of legislative behaviour in Congress has relied heavily on theanalyses of roll call votes (RCVs) and the inﬂuence of this body of scholar-ship is evident throughout this book. It is not too radical to claim that thestudy of legislative behaviour has been transformed in the past two decadesby these analytical techniques. Legislative voting records clearly provide veryimportant information about legislative behaviour, voting cohesiveness andperhaps, though more controversially, ideological preferences. DemocraticPolitics in the European Parliament represents the culmination of an ambitiousand formidable data-collection exercise in this tradition. By collecting all rollcall votes in the European Parliament since 1979 the authors have made anextremely valuable contribution to legislative and EU studies. Already thedata set is being widely used by scholars around the world to various ends.Our understanding of legislative behaviour in the EP has been and willcontinue to be greatly enhanced by the application to this setting of the tech-nical tools developed for Congress. But roll call votes also have limitationsand future scholars who make use of this rich data set must be aware of,acknowledge and correct for the problems associated with their use.Unlike the US experience, not all votes in the EP are by roll call and thisgenerates signiﬁcant questions about the representative characteristics of thesamples we observe. Currently roll calls number around one-third of all votes,and we still know too little about the process by which roll calls aregenerated to conclude that this is a random sample from the universe of allvotes. Roll calls in the EP may be corrupted by strategic considerations, whichwill affect the inferences we can draw from them. Indeed, even where all votesare recorded by roll call, the range of vote choices and therefore outcomeswill be limited by the inﬂuence of pre-ﬂoor stages of legislative preparationas well as by decisions regarding the ﬂoor agenda (Lawrence et al., 2006).Thus, even where members have permission to vote according to theirconscience during plenary sessions, parties (particularly those with a4 3 6European Union Politics 8(3)majority) may constrain members’ voting behaviour by controlling thelegislative agenda. This issue aside, the more pressing and challengingdifﬁculty with the use of RCVs in the EP is that the majority of votes gounrecorded.Hix et al. (2007: 30) hold that it is not unreasonable to assume that roll callvotes are requested on the most important issues in the EP. But preliminaryresearch (Carrubba et al., 2006) on votes in the ﬁfth Parliament (1999–2004)suggest that roll calls are disproportionately called on resolutions rather thanunder the co-decision procedure. Thus, legislatively consequential votes areunder-sampled, which may run counter to the argument that roll calls arecalled on the most important votes. If the assumption of importance isweakened, does this affect the inferences we draw? How might this over-representation of votes on non-legislative issues affect our conﬁdence incohesion indices or NOMINATE scores? With regard to cohesion, thedirection of bias introduced by the over-sampling of non-legislative votes isnot by any means obvious. On the one hand, this underrepresentation oflegislative votes in the roll call sample may bias the levels of cohesion down-wards. If most roll call votes are of little legislative consequence, do politicalgroups bother expending limited resources on whipping party members intoline? On the other hand, as the authors demonstrate in chapter four,attendance at roll call votes goes up with the legislative importance of the vote.Is it the case that only the most loyal, career-minded MEPs turn up for voteson resolutions? This may have the effect of inﬂating the actual levels ofcohesion of political groups in the EP, if such votes are over-sampled. Yetanother possibility is that the lower turnout on resolutions reﬂects the fact thatonly those truly interested turn up, and that the subset of votes thus reﬂectsthe interests of preference outliers. We do not know the answers to suchquestions; it may very well be that attendance rates or legislative signiﬁcanceare not related systematically to levels of cohesion. The countervailingdynamics that potentially exist here suggest some interesting questions thatfuture analysts mining this data set will need to consider.The authors further document that the number of roll calls has increaseddramatically over time, which may in part diminish the importance of theabove questions; as the number of votes increases, their representative natureis likely to improve. But do these varying levels of roll calls give rise toadditional concerns about cross-parliamentary comparisons? There werefewer than 900 roll calls in the ﬁrst Parliament (1979–84), compared with over5000 in the ﬁfth (1999–2004). Can we have the same conﬁdence in the resultsdrawn from the much smaller samples in the early Parliaments as we do inthose from the fourth and ﬁfth Parliaments?A more general shortcoming of the NOMINATE procedure is that it doesnot typically provide uncertainty estimates (such as standard errors andMcElroy Legislative Politics as Normal?4 3 7conﬁdence intervals). This may lead to a false sense of precision for those whouse the scores.1 A particular problem that does not seem to be of concern inthe congressional literature but may be more relevant in the European Parlia-ment context is the large variation in member participation rates in roll calls.In a given Parliament, some MEPs vote thousands of times whereas othersvote a mere handful of times. This reﬂects high absentee rates, comparativelylarge turnover rates in membership between elections and, more worryinglyperhaps, strategic absences (not to be confused with ofﬁcial abstentions). Forinstance, in the current Parliament many of the new members from EastEuropean countries have particularly poor voting records. We can obtainNOMINATE scores with as few as 20 votes, but it is problematic if one MEP’sscores are calculated with 1600 votes and the scores of another with only 40when no uncertainty estimates are generated.To interpret the scores that are generated by NOMINATE as preferencemeasures is common practice in congressional work, primarily because it isone measure of something unobservable that lies at the heart of much of whatwe, as political scientists, are interested in. The authors of this book largely,and judiciously, shy away from this particular interpretation in the context ofthe EP, though the data they have generated may unwisely be utilized to thisend by others. The argument sustained throughout this book very much indi-cates that these are not party-free measures of preferences and should not beused as proxies for ideology. Nevertheless, preferences need to be approxi-mated if we are to test theories of legislative decision-making or addressquestions about whether or not key parliamentary bodies such as committeesare representative agents of their principal (Parliament). Alternative measuressuch as elite surveys suffer from serious sample response issues, and eventhis aside there is no actual obligation on those who respond to be truthful.Measures based on constituency characteristics , which have proved popularin the USA, are also problematic given the very vague notion of constituencyin the EP. One ﬁnal possibility is to make use of the recent interest groupratings from organizations such as Friends of the Earth, though again thesesuffer from small sample size issues and may exaggerate extremism andbipolarity (Snyder, 1992). There is clearly no silver bullet solution to thepreference measurement problem that legislative scholars confront, but cross-validation of the various measures is recommended.Similarly, testing spatial models of legislative behaviour fundamentallydepends on our ability to accurately gauge the number and nature of the politi-cal dimensions on which parties compete. The authors’ analysis of roll callvoting in chapter nine demonstrates that there are broadly two dimensions onwhich the political groups compete and that these dimensions have beenrelatively stable over time. The ﬁrst dimension fairly conclusively maps ageneral left–right policy dimension, which lends weight to the overall4 3 8European Union Politics 8(3)argument that party competition is deﬁned ideologically rather than terri-torially. But the second dimension, the authors readily admit, is more difﬁcultto interpret substantively. It may represent some European-level govern-ment–opposition dynamics and/or a pro-EU integration versus anti-EUintegration dimension. The interpretation of dimensions relies primarily on aresearcher’s substantive knowledge but may be complicated in the case of theEP if selection biases are evident in roll call votes. Again the question of therepresentativeness of roll calls is fundamental here. If RCVs are not repre-sentative by issue area, this may affect the conclusions we draw about thenature of the policy space. If roll calls are called disproportionately in certainpolicy domains, this may lead to the overemphasis of particular dimensionsof conﬂict in NOMINATE-type analysis.Carrubba et al. (2006) suggest that a degree of caution is required in theinterpretation of and generalization from roll calls in the European Parliament.Overall, their work ﬁnds evidence for pooling concerns, the asymmetric useof roll calls under different legislative procedures and the calling of RCVsdisproportionately by particular political groups (notably the Greens) and inparticular issue areas. More work on disaggregated votes may lead to in-teresting ﬁndings; pooling RCVs on co-decisions with those on resolutionsmay not be ideal without ﬁrst knowing for certain that they are generated bythe same processes and whether they experience the same degree of whipping.None of this is to argue that the use of roll calls should be abandoned butrather their use necessitates explicit consideration of the process by which rollcalls are produced. In addition, disaggregating votes by issue area might provea fruitful exercise: for instance, does the subsample of votes on environmentalissues lead to a clear green policy dimension emerging? More work on compar-ing the sample of roll calls to the universe of actual (and indeed potential)votes would greatly enhance our conﬁdence in the inferences we draw. Overallthese issues suggest that the analysis of roll call votes has much potential.There is clearly scope for further development of roll call analyses through theuse of more sophisticated techniques such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain(MCMC) modelling, which also generates uncertainty estimates. In conclusion,the contribution of Hix et al. (2007) via the data set, which accompanies thebook, cannot be overestimated.Moving beyond the ﬂoorDespite the particular issues that arise with the use of RCVs in the EP, it isconvincingly demonstrated over the course of this book that the politicalgroups in the European Parliament have become increasingly cohesive overMcElroy Legislative Politics as Normal?4 3 9time. A crucial question that the work thus motivates is how such unity iscreated. Political parties in established democracies typically exhibit suchhigh levels of cohesion that the question of how such discipline has arisenhas, until recently, received little attention (Bowler et al., 1999). In emerginglegislatures, however, the process of transforming rudimentary party organiz-ations into disciplined parties is not inevitable. What mechanisms are usedto achieve this end? How party discipline arises and how it is maintained arecentral questions of interest in legislative studies. Our knowledge of thesetopics, however, suffers from substantial gaps, especially with regard to thepractice of party discipline outside the relatively familiar Anglo-Americansetting.If we are fully to disentangle the concepts of ideological afﬁnity and partydiscipline, we need to look beyond the voting behaviour of MEPs. A partythat is cohesive because of an afﬁnity of ideological viewpoints and aparty that is cohesive because its members are whipped into line are obser-vationally equivalent when one restricts one’s analysis solely to ﬂoor voting.Krehbiel (1993) has put the argument for afﬁnity mostly forcefully, arguingthat parties merely reﬂect their members’ preferences; they provide neitherstructure nor constraint. He posits that legislative outcomes (via voting) arenot the product of parliamentary party discipline but rather reﬂect the distri-bution of preferences of the party’s members.The challenge of creating cohesive political parties is not trivial in theEuropean Parliament. The literature on party discipline tends to focus onelectoral incentives as a means of inducing party loyalty, but the EuropeanParliament provides a particularly interesting case study because theseinducements are very weak, if not entirely missing. To the extent thatelectoral incentives shape much of the behaviour of political actors, the politi-cal groups in the European Parliament are clearly greatly disadvantagedwhen compared with their national counterparts. They do not control accessto the electoral ballot, they do not have resources to ﬁnance electioncampaigns and, additionally, MEPs need not fear that rebellious behaviourwill force early elections. Although the prospects for cohesion appear quitebleak, the book by Hix et al. (2007) demonstrates quite persuasively that thishas not been the experience of the political groups in the EP. Given the highlyconstrained environment in which the political groups operate, how can weaccount for the rise in political group cohesion? The ﬁndings of this bookmotivate many questions that perhaps can be answered only by closerexamination of the activities of MEPs both within their political groups andwithin the committee system.A system of credible sanctions and rewards is one means of resolving thecollective dilemmas that all parties face. Do these sanctions and rewards exist4 4 0European Union Politics 8(3)internally to the EP and are they systematically used to punish and rewardparty defectors and loyalists? It is almost certainly the case that intra-parliamentary incentives to encourage cohesion operate in all legislativebodies, but often these are overshadowed by electoral considerations. Thestudy of party discipline in the European Parliament allows legislativescholars more neatly to isolate the internal and electoral factors in an actor’smotivation structure, with implications for the general study of legislativebehaviour. The European Parliament offers scholars a particularly good casestudy for demonstrating the importance of internal advancement in a politi-cal actor’s motivations, because it is one of the few contexts in which theelectoral connection is not clearly dominant. One obvious avenue of researchis to examine whether or not those who vote against the party are sanctionedvia the loss of valuable ofﬁces within the Parliament or the political groupstructure. Does the committee system, for instance, provide the politicalgroups with an important source of patronage, in addition to acting as asource of policy expertise? As is the case with the US Congress, and increas-ingly with a wide variety of legislatures across the world, committees are thelifeblood of the European Parliament. The political groups have played acrucial and very deliberate role in the organization of parliamentarycommittees from the outset. In particular, the committee assignment processis controlled by political groups rather than through a seniority-type norm asin the US Congress. In addition, there is a clear hierarchy of committees, withcommittee prestige largely determined by the degree of legislative powers theEP has in a given policy jurisdiction. Positions on these high-statuscommittees are very much sought after by ambitious MEPs. This hierarchyof prestige and control of the assignment process grants the party leaderssome power vis-à-vis individual MEPs. Not only has the committee systemexpanded to provide ‘jobs for the boys’, but control over the committeeassignment process and committee chairs has been strongly tightened overthe years. In general, the career trajectories of MEPs and how these relate totheir behaviour on the ﬂoor (if at all) offers some wonderful research oppor-tunities for future legislative scholars. How do MEPs’ career expectationsinﬂuence their legislative behaviour and, in turn, how does this behaviourimpact on their future career trajectories?On a related note, the question of who controls the MEPs – nationalparties or political groups – is addressed in chapter seven. The evidence heresuggests that members vote with their political group most of the time, butthere is also evidence of voting against the political group in favour of amember’s national delegation when the two do not coincide. On a minorstatistical note, it is worth considering that in any group versus subgroupcomparison one is ‘virtually guaranteed to ﬁnd that subgroups are moreMcElroy Legislative Politics as Normal?4 4 1cohesive than groups’ (Desposato, 2003: 281), especially when subgroups aresmall, as is the case with many national delegations. The overall result thatnational parties are MEPs’ principal is a little disquieting because it suggeststhat political groups are not as fully institutionalized or as powerful ascohesion scores taken at face value might indicate. Interesting questions ariseabout the nature of the relationship between national parties and their parentpolitical groups. Is the political group more than the sum of its nationalparties? Are some national parties more privileged than others in the politi-cal group structure, perhaps as a function of size? Can fully institutionalizednational political parties be conceived of as similar to factions within thesupranational political group? One obvious question that needs to beaddressed further is whether or not national delegations are givenexemptions by their political group on certain votes. This may occur forinstance when matters of national importance are at stake and/or the nationalparty’s vote does not affect the overall success or failure of the ballot. Overall,the results in this chapter motivate some fascinating questions about whathappens when there is incongruence between the policy positions of nationaldelegations and those of the political group.Agenda controlChapter six of the book examines the impact of agenda-setting powers oncohesion levels but ﬁnds little evidence to support this hypothesis. The authorsconclude that ‘parties in the European Parliament have only a limited oppor-tunity to use their agenda setting powers to control the voting behaviour oftheir backbench members’ (Hix et al., 2007: 130). Part of the problem with thistype of proposition and analysis is the great difﬁculty of capturing and measur-ing the concept of agenda control in cross-sectional statistical models. Giventhe proportional norms that govern procedural matters inside the EP, the effectof agenda-setting powers will be conditional on party size, though clearly thetwo issues are conceptually distinct. The results in chapter six are on the wholeweak, the explained variance of the models, despite the inclusion of upwardsof 20 variables, ranges between 1% and 4%. These models are clearly notexplaining a great deal, even though some individual coefﬁcients are signiﬁ-cant. The question arises of whether or not the measures utilized are reallycapturing agenda-setting powers. Do we reject the hypothesis that agenda-setting powers are not very important in explaining cohesion levels in the EP,or do we accept the ancillary hypothesis that the measures for such complexconcepts as agenda-setting are imprecise? Measurement is the challenge forfuture scholars, and perhaps a complementary approach that examines the4 4 2European Union Politics 8(3)historical struggles over agenda-setting powers within the Parliament wouldbe worth pursuing. In addition, recent work by Schneider et al. (2006) high-lights the need for better models of EU decision-making in general, particu-larly models that incorporate the consensual norms that are the hallmark ofEU politics.Empirical research into battles over the organization of the Parliamentand the evolution of the rules of procedure has been surprisingly limited andmostly anecdotal to date. Apart from work by Williams (1995) and Kreppel(2002), there is little critical analysis of the internal evolution of the Parlia-ment.2 In the period 1979–2007 considerably more than 1000 rule changeswere proposed by the various Rules Committees. The volume of proceduralproposals is noteworthy; a great deal of parliamentary time has been dedi-cated to structuring the institution. The formal rules of the legislative gameinside the European Parliament have been highly contested over the courseof the past 30 years, which would indicate that agenda-setting powers are notperceived as irrelevant by the main actors. Procedural matters may not be ofpressing concern in legislatures that possess a large and disciplined majority(Binder, 1997), but where such conditions are absent, as in the EP, legislativerules become important tools for actors who wish to build and sustain stableand cohesive parties. The history of the European Parliament is marked bylengthy battles over what appear to be organizational minutiae. The amountof effort and parliamentary time devoted to changing rules does not accordwith a non-partisan account of procedural choice. As Willi Rothleycommented in plenary in 1993, ‘[t]he Rules of Procedure are Parliament’sConstitution. Matters affecting the Rules of Procedure are therefore alwayspolitical matters’ (14 March 1993). In addition, the timing of many changesdoes not accord with changes in the external environment. The debates inParliament reveal that the two largest parties – the European People’s Party(EPP) and the Party of the European Socialists (PES) – have frequently actedin concert to shape the rules to their collective beneﬁt.Interpreting rule change and rule evolution can be a difﬁcult and sub-jective exercise because rule changes are open to multiple interpretations.What type of evidence would be convincing corroboration of purposive andintentional action on the part of the political groups in the EP to promotecohesion? Is a rule that limits the speaking rights of individual memberssimply an attempt to use a limited parliamentary schedule more efﬁciently,or does it signal an attempt to reduce the rights of individual parliamen-tarians? Most rule changes will appear technical and of minor consequenceeven if intended for some more partisan purpose; it is in the interests of theproposer to cloak them in neutral language. In addition, it is possible thatrules that may have profound partisan consequences down the line may notMcElroy Legislative Politics as Normal?4 4 3actually have been originally intended for this purpose. One method of over-coming the problems inherent in interpreting rules is to examine the debatesthat surrounded their introduction. Were they perceived to be only technicalby the key actors involved? The debates of the European Parliament have notbeen subject to signiﬁcant analyses and they are an unmined treasure trovefor those interested in the historical evolution of the institution.The debates on the general revision of the Rules of Procedure in the ﬁrstdirectly elected Parliament provide an illustrative example of the potentialfor this alternative and complementary approach to the vexing question ofagenda powers. Much of the debate hinged on the rights of big groups versussmall groups, but it was also asserted that the proposed revisions aimed toquell dissent within the large political groups themselves. Mario Capanna,speaking on behalf of the Communists declared that,This idiotic policy with regard to the Rules of Procedure has a very speciﬁc objectin view, namely to reduce the areas of dissent within Parliament. And I meandissent not only among the minority groups but also within the majority groupswhether of the right, centre-right or even, occasionally, the left.3Else Hammerick, of the small left-wing Rainbow coalition (ARC), reiteratedthis point when she complained about the new proposal to limit explanationsof the vote. She argued that not only would this proposal serve to strengthenthe large political groups vis-à-vis the small ones but it would also serve toweaken dissenting party members within the large parties.In future only one representative of each group would be allowed an explanationof vote before voting took place. Only one from each group, that would sub-stantially strengthen the position of the supranational political groups with theirpecking orders and hierarchies, and correspondingly weaken those who do notshare the group’s majority views and weaken national minorities within them. Inthe past explanations of vote gave these minorities a chance to speak.4The manner and means by which elected representatives attempt to gettheir own preferences aired vary from legislature to legislature, but theybroadly fall into two categories: the right to table questions and the right toplace amendments on the parliamentary agenda. Major revisions of the rulesundertaken since 1979 have effectively removed many of these privilegesfrom individual members. For instance, the right to table amendments inParliament, the right to refer a report back to committee, the right to call foran adjournment of debate and the right to call for a debate on a matter ofurgency have all been revoked from individual MEPs. Such rights now restwith political groups or 40 members acting in concert. With the passage ofthese revisions, individual members have been emasculated. Speaking time4 4 4European Union Politics 8(3)has also been drastically reduced over the years. In April 1979 there wasno limitation, for example, on the length of time a member could devote toan ‘explanation of the vote’; by 2007 this right had been severely circum-scribed such that a member ‘may give an oral explanation on the ﬁnal votefor not longer than one minute’ (European Parliament, 2007: 163). Rule 142further dictates that ‘No Member may speak for more than one minute onany of the following: the minutes, procedural motions, amendments to theﬁnal draft agenda or to the agenda’. These policies not only stiﬂe indepen-dent members but also serve to stiﬂe dissent within the larger groups.The EP’s limits on individual rights are among the most restrictive inEurope. Individual legislators do not possess signiﬁcant speaking rights oradjournment rights in the EP, and what rights they did have, have beenseverely circumscribed over the course of the past 25 years. Over the years,political groups have become the gatekeepers of legislative amendments andof most interruptive and procedural motions in the EP, and even a preliminaryanalysis of the debates on this matter suggest that the two largest politicalgroups consciously undertook these rule changes. Before we dismiss the roleof agenda-setting powers in creating political group cohesion we shouldexamine rule evolution in this institution in greater detail.A dynamic party systemParties form, fail, merge and divide on a staggering basis in the EP. Simplykeeping track of which MEPs are in which political groups and which nationalparties are afﬁliated with which of the supranational groups is no mean feat.It is generally the case that in the literature on political parties far too littleattention is paid ‘to the evolution of party systems between elections’ (Laverand Benoit, 2003). The authors of this book argue that there are ‘six mainpolitical “families” which have remained relatively consistent across all sixelected parliaments’ (Hix et al., 2007: 23) and they identify these as socialdemocrat, centre-right, liberal, radical left, green and anti-European. This isnot a controversial claim, but the use of six party ‘families’ as the basic unitof analysis in parts of the book may not capture the full extent of dynamismthat exists in the EP. This dynamism in party group formation is also ofinterest to the very question of cohesion. Party families do not whip membersinto line and this choice of analytical unit may depress the cohesion scoresfor the smaller political groups, which appear at times to have been mergedby the authors into one family. As the authors openly acknowledge, theradical left comprised several different political groups until well into thethird Parliament. Even excluding independents, there were 10 separateMcElroy Legislative Politics as Normal?4 4 5political groups in the EP for most of the third legislative session, not six. Thenumber of political groups in the EP varies over time and only the three mainpolitical groups can be thought of as party families in the traditional sensefor most of the history of the directly elected parliament.As a general explanatory variable, party family has shortcomings whenit comes to explaining the dynamic nature of political groups in the EP.Although capturing the broad spirit of the ideological basis on which partygroupings originally formed, the party family explanation inadequatelyexplains national party afﬁliation with EP party groups. First, party family isan essentially static characterization, based on long-standing, ‘essential andindelible’ (Klingemann et al., 1994: 24) issue associations and positions,whereas national parties frequently and regularly switch EP party groups.Second, many national parties do not belong to clearly deﬁnable partyfamilies, either because their organizational basis does not correspond to theclassic cleavages or because they are formed primarily around new (single)issues such as Europe or immigration. This situation characterizes many ofthe parties from the eight post-communist member states.A general problem with the concept of party family as an operationalvariable is that, despite its wide use, the classiﬁcation of party family remainsunderspeciﬁed. Even after years of research, there exists no golden index ofparty family afﬁliations. This problem is exacerbated when one attempts toextend the concept of party family beyond its West European base. Forinstance, there are large numbers of parties in Eastern Europe that cannoteasily be classiﬁed in terms of party families because they do not share eitheran ideological heritage or associational links with their West Europeancounterparts. Even advocates of the party family approach and experts in thepolitics of Eastern Europe cannot place these political parties deﬁnitively intoparty families. For instance, Taggart and Szczerbiak (2004) place many partiessuch as the Czech Civic Democratic Party, the Slovak Christian DemocraticMovement and the Polish Union of Real Politics into both the Liberal andConservative party family in their study. There is much disagreement on whateven constitutes a party family. For example, do agrarian and centre partiesform one party family or two party families? Nonetheless, the associationbetween party family and policies towards European integration has beenused to conclude that political contestation in the European arena is largelydriven by cleavage patterns (Marks and Wilson, 2000; Marks et al., 2002).The dynamics and evolution of the party system within the EP offer afruitful avenue of research for party scholars. In terms of party cohesion, thisdynamism offers interesting possibilities. Are national parties or MEPs whofail to toe the political group line forced to leave the party, or do they volun-tarily jump ship? Do legislators alter their voting behaviour as a consequence4 4 6European Union Politics 8(3)of changing party afﬁliation? If they fail to do so, we may have evidence ofpartyless voting behaviour and perhaps have more conﬁdence in the use ofNOMINATE scores as ideological proxies. If, however, we witness changethis may be further evidence of party discipline. If legislators switch from amore to a less disciplined party (or vice versa) and thus become subject toshifting degrees of party instruction across roll calls, the matter becomes evenmore complex (Rosenthal and Voeten, 2004). In future work one could addressthese issues by dividing up the voting records of party-switchers and esti-mating separate ideal points for the two parties they have afﬁliated with inthe course of a single legislative session.ConclusionThese are exciting times for EP scholars. Better data and analytical tools havebecome available in recent years that allow for much more systematic analysisof legislative behaviour. In Democratic Politics in the European Parliament, Hix,Noury and Roland ask many fundamental questions about the nature oflegislative organization in the European Parliament and provide manyanswers. Perhaps even more importantly, this book challenges and motivatesa whole host of new puzzles, in the ﬁnest traditions of scientiﬁc research, anddeserves a very wide readership.On a ﬁnal note, this book has fulﬁlled its mission to connect research onthe European Parliament to the general study of legislative behaviour andinstitutions in political science. The true promise and potential of EU scholar-ship is that it provides a testing ground for extant theories of legislativebehaviour, reinforcing what we already know and offering the possibility offalsiﬁcation and, most importantly, the opportunity to broaden the trends inlegislative studies in general. It is remarkable that our understanding oflegislative politics is largely dictated by the experience of the US House ofRepresentatives. The similarities with the EP make for relatively easycomparison, but it is perhaps the differences, such as the lack of an electoralconnection, that will be most instructive. How such differences inﬂuenceactors’ incentive structures and motivations and, as a consequence, theirbehaviour and decision outcomes may fundamentally affect our very under-standing of legislative politics.NotesThis Forum article was commissioned by Gerald Schneider in the Autumn of 2006and all editorial work was undertaken by Matthew Gabel.McElroy Legislative Politics as Normal?4 4 71 Though not normally provided by the standard NOMINATE package, con-ﬁdence intervals can be produced for NOMINATE scores; see Lewis andPoole (2004).2 For similar work on the Council of Ministers, see Carrubba and Volden (2001).For an account of procedural choice and rule evolution across the EuropeanUnion as a whole, see Jupille (2004).3 Debates of the European Parliament, 8 July 1980.4 Debates of the European Parliament, 26 March 1981.References<ref>Binder, Sarah (1997) Minority Rights, Majority Rule: Partisanship and the Develop-</ref>ment of Congress.
