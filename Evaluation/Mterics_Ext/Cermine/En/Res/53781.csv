Even in private sector,bureaucratic organization is very much essential for its smooth functioning and betterment. Alegalized domination of bureaucracy only can ensure highest efficiency of an organization in acountry. But the state bureaucracy of Bangladesh not developed legally from Pre-colonial period topost-colonial phase as well as an independent Bangladesh eventually. The state bureaucracy ofBangladesh is patrimonial in nature based on personal interests. The politicians and bureaucrats areinterdependent in various manners for the fulfillment of their purpose illegally in DemocraticBangladesh. Simultaneously, the impact of militarism still exists in state bureaucracy of Bangladeshas it faced military rule in several times.Keywords: bureaucracy; politicians; Bangladesh; military1. INTRODUCTIONThe extension of society is state. Sometimes Plato treats state as society. According toPlato, state grows out of the nature of individual. Plato said, ‘‘the state is a natural institution,natural because it reflects the structure of human nature. The origin of the state is a reflectionof man’s economic needs, for, says Plato, `a state comes into existence because no individualis self-sufficing; we all have many needs.” (Stumpf: 1975). On the basis of knowledge andnature of a society, Plato designed the ideal type of state considering three distinctive classes;King Philosopher, Warrior and Producer. Unlike Plato, Aristotle did not create a blueprintfor an ideal state. But in his Politics, Aristotle says that, “it is evident that the State is acreature of nature, and that man is by nature a political animal.” (Stumpf: 1975). Aristotleviewed the state as the agency for enabling men to achieve their ultimate goals as humanbeing. Aristotle also sketched the different types of state nature; like Monarchy (one ruler),Aristocracy (few rulers) and Polity (many). He observed three idiosyncratic classes in state;Extreme Rich, Middle class and Extreme poor. His preference was middle class for governingstate to the holistic welfare.As an Enlightenment philosopher, Hobbs, Locke and Rousseau tried to observe state asa new dimension. According to Hobbs state was uneven for the people in primary stage. Heargued that social contract to be needed for declining the inequality. According to Locke, theThis is an open access article under the CC-BY 4.0 license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)44Volume 7uneven nature of state was the golden age of human society which becomes conflicting later.For the resolution of such conflict, absence of common authority is essential, Locke argued.For Rousseau, man is free by birth, but step by step they become chained by socialsurrounding. In that situation, Rousseau expects the state interference to the freedom ofpeople. From the Marxist point of view, the state is a special organ that appears at a certainmoment in the historical evolution of mankind. It is born from the division of society intoclasses and act as an instrument in the hands of the possessing class for the purpose ofmaintaining the domination of this class over society. (Mandel: 2003).This domination causes class conflict in a society. According to Karl Marx, state is themeans of economic conflict but noting. Levine stated that the rise of state involved theseparation of the public and private spheres and the development of specialized politicalinstitutions. (Levine: 1924). Max Weber argued that sometimes political components controlover the economic elements in the state on the basis of authority. He characterized three idealtypes of legitimate authority by state nature; Rational Legitimacy, Traditional Legitimacy andCharismatic Legitimacy. (Abraham & Morgan: 1994). According to Weber, modern statebased on legal authority which led to formation of governing body called bureaucracy.Without bureaucracy state never run purposively, Weber argued. Our objective of the study isto elucidate state nature according to bureaucratic characteristics on the basis of theoreticalunderstanding in post colonial period of Bangladesh. Weber’s explanation of bureaucracy andits later discussion underpins the study for gaining our objectives.2. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKThe Study of Weber’s BureaucracyHistorical context of Bureaucracy: Bureaucratic Theory was developed by a GermanSociologist and political economist Max Weber. According to him, bureaucracy is the mostefficient form of organization which has a well-defined line of authority. It has clear rules andregulations which are strictly followed. Weber believed that a bureaucratic type oforganization began in societies whose political organization tended toward officialdom. Asdescribed by Ken Morrision, Early examples of societies with large political administrationsinclude the Germanic and Mongolian empires, and feudal estates of the twelfth and thirteenthcentury. Among these societies, Weber cited the cases of emperors and feudal lords who,when making known their decrees and pronouncements, would appoint commissioners whosepower were exercised within the lord’s jurisdiction. Weber identified six basic types ofBureaucratic structure: (Morrision: 1998) –1. States which tend to control policy and policing functions;2. Ecclesiastical communities which are required to administer to large populations ofbelievers;3. Economies whose main function is to distribute goods and coordinate functions;4. The modern agency;5. The military and6. The judiciaryWeber looked at the administration of early Egypt and Rome, at the administration ofCatholic Church, at Asiatic societies and at feudal economies of central Europe. While thesesocieties develop administrative staff and trained decision maker, they are in weber’s view,International Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 745formally pre-bureaucratic in their administration which restricts the development ofbureaucracy to modern society. According to Hellen Constas, Weber defined such kinds ofbureaucracy is patrimonial bureaucracy depends on charismatic or traditional authority(Constas: 1958).Mainly Max Weber talked about the bureaucracy based on legal or rational legitimacyin modern industrial society. According to Weber, ‘Bureaucracy refers to an instrument thathas become indispensible for the rational attainment of the goals of any organization inindustrial society’. (Rao: 2000). According to Weber, the term bureaucracy in terms of anorganization and management functions refers to the following six principles (Miller: 2008):Management by rules: A bureaucracy follows a consistent set of rules that control thefunctions of the organization. Management controls the lower levels of the organization'shierarchy by applying established rules in a consistent and predictable manner.Division of labor: Authority and responsibility are clearly defined and officially sanctioned.Job descriptions are specified with responsibilities and line of authority. All employees havethus clearly defined rules in a system of authority and subordination.Formal hierarchical structure: An organization is organized into a hierarchy of authorityand follows a clear chain of command. The hierarchical structure effectively delineates thelines of authority and the subordination of the lower levels to the upper levels of thehierarchical structure.Personnel hired on grounds of technical competence: Appointment to a position within theorganization is made on the grounds of technical competence. Work is assigned based on theexperience and competence of the individual.Managers are salaried officials: A manager is a salaried official and does own theadministered unit. All elements of a bureaucracy are defined with clearly defined roles andresponsibilities and are managed by trained and experienced specialists.Written documents: All decisions, rules and actions taken by the organization are formulatedand recorded in writing. Written documents ensure that there is continuity of theorganization’s policies and procedures.Max Weber was the first to give an elaborate account of the development ofbureaucracy as well as its causes and consequences. According to Weber, modernofficialdom functions in the specific manner. He attributed the following characteristics tobureaucracy in his book ‘Economy and Society’ (Weber: 1968) –I. There is the principle of fixed and official jurisdictional areas, which are generally orderedby rules, that is, by laws or administrative regulations.1. The regular activities required for the purposes of the bureaucratically governedstructure are distributed in a fixed way as official duties.2. The authority to give the commands required for the discharge of these duties isdistributed in a stable way and is strictly delimited by rules concerning the coercivemeans, physical, sacerdotal, or otherwise, which may be placed at the disposal ofofficials.3. Methodical provision is made for the regular and continuous fulfillment of theseduties and for the execution of the corresponding rights; only persons who have thegenerally regulated qualifications to serve are employed.46Volume 7In public and lawful government these three elements constitute 'bureaucratic authority.' Inprivate economic domination, they constitute bureaucratic 'management.' Bureaucracy, thusunderstood, is fully developed in political and ecclesiastical communities only in the modernstate, and, in the private economy, only in the most advanced institutions of capitalism.Permanent and public office authority, with fixed jurisdiction, is not the historical rule butrather the exception. This is so even in large political structures such as those of the ancientOrient, the Germanic and Mongolian empires of conquest, or of many feudal structures ofstate. In all these cases, the ruler executes the most important measures through personaltrustees, table-companions, or court-servants. Their commissions and authority are notprecisely delimited and are temporarily called into being for each case.II. The principles of office hierarchy and of levels of graded authority mean a firmly orderedsystem of super- and subordination in which there is a supervision of the lower offices by thehigher ones. Such a system offers the governed the possibility of appealing the decision of alower office to its higher authority, in a definitely regulated manner. With the fulldevelopment of the bureaucratic type, the office hierarchy is monocratically organized. Theprinciple of hierarchical office authority is found in all bureaucratic structures: in state andecclesiastical structures as well as in large party organizations and 'private' or privateenterprises. It does not matter for the character of bureaucracy whether its authority is called'public.'When the principle of jurisdictional 'competency' is fully carried through, hierarchicalsubordination--at least in public office--does not mean that the 'higher' authority is simplyauthorized to take over the business of the 'lower.' Indeed, the opposite is the rule. Onceestablished and having fulfilled its task, an office tends to continue in existence and be heldby another incumbent.III. The management of the modern office is based upon written documents ('the files'),which are preserved in their original or draught form. There is, therefore, a staff of subalternofficials and scribes of all sorts. The body of officials actively engaged in a 'public' office,along with the respective apparatus of material implements and the files make up a 'bureau.'In private enterprise, 'the bureau' is often called 'the office.'In principle, the modern organization of the civil service separates the bureau from theprivate domicile of the official, and, in general, bureaucracy segregates official activity assomething distinct from the sphere of private life. Public monies and equipment are divorcedfrom the private property of the official. This condition is everywhere the product of a longdevelopment. Nowadays, it is found in public as well as in private enterprises; in the latter,the principle extends even to the leading entrepreneur. In principle, the executive office isseparated from the household, business from private correspondence, and business assetsfrom private fortunes. The more consistently the modern type of business management hasbeen carried through the more are these separations the case. The beginnings of this processare to be found as early as the middle Ages.IV. Office management, at least all specialized office management-- and such management isdistinctly modern--usually presupposes thorough and expert training. This increasingly holdsfor the modern executive and employee of private enterprises, in the same manner as it holdsfor the state official.V. When the office is fully developed, official activity demands the full working capacity ofthe official, irrespective of the fact that his obligatory time in the bureau may be firmlydelimited. In the normal case, this is only the product of a long development, in the public asInternational Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 747well as in the private office. Formerly, in all cases, the normal state of affairs was reversed:official business was discharged as a secondary activity.VI. The management of the office follows general rules, which are more or less stable, moreor less exhaustive, and which can be learned. Knowledge of these rules represents a specialtechnical learning which the officials possess. It involves jurisprudence, or administrative orbusiness management.The reduction of modern office management to rules is deeply embedded in its very nature.The theory of modern public administration, for instance, assumes that the authority to ordercertain matters by decree--which has been legally granted to public authorities--does notentitle the bureau to regulate the matter by commands given for each case, but only toregulate the matter abstractly. This stands in extreme contrast to the regulation of allrelationships through individual privileges and bestowals of favor, which is absolutelydominant in patrimonialism, at least in so far as such relationships are not fixed by sacredtradition.State Bureaucracy in Bangladesh perspectiveHamza Alavi (1921-2003): There are very few theoretical contribution instituted onthe study of post-colonial state like Bangladesh. Alavi’s one of the most important worksentitled `The State in post-colonial societies: Pakistan and Bangladesh’ based oninterpretation of autonomous state in the third world. According to Anupam Sen, `His mainargument is as follows: in the colonial period the bureaucratic military state apparatus wasoverdeveloped because it had to exercise domination over the native social classes. In thepost-colonial period too, Alavi Argues, the state has remain autonomous, because no singleclass has succeeded in establishing its rule over the over-developed state.’ (Sen: 2009). In histheoretical explanation, Alavi tried build up relationship between bureaucracy and othersocial classes. He also revealed that bureaucracy act as an interwoven among the interest ofthree social classes; Metropolitan Bourgeoisie, Indigenous Bourgeoisie and Upper classbased on land. (Alam: 2007). The main arguments of his theory are as follows –1. State bureaucracy is overdeveloped in post-colonial societies2. Indigenous bourgeoisie are underdeveloped3. State bureaucracy is autonomous.He also pointed out that the post-colonial state is surrounded and driven by powerfulbureaucratic military. This point is very much applicable to understand post-colonial statenature of Bangladesh.Anupam Sen: He introduced bureaucratic interpretation in his PhD dissertation fromnew-Marxist point of view. Dr. Sen tried to find out the limitation of Hamza Alavi’sinterpretation of Bureaucracy and state nature of post-colonial Bangladesh. According to Sen,`It is true that, as he (Alavi) asserts, the classes in most third world countries areunderdeveloped. But it is not true; as he claims that the state apparatus was over –development in the colonial period. In fact, in many independent but semi-colonizedcountries – such as most Latin American countries and Nepal, Thailand, Afghanistan and Iranfor example – the state apparatus, the bureaucracy, the judiciary, etc., remainunderdeveloped. (Sen: 2009).Dr. Sen stated that the social classes in most post-colonial third world societies havefailed to establish their hegemony over the state not because the state apparatus was over48Volume 7developed by the colonial rulers, as Alavi argues, but because the state was stronger than thesocial classes long before these societies were colonized.The state apparatus in most pre-colonial societies was patriarchal but superior vis-à-visthe indigenous social classes. The colonial state apparatus, at least in the case of India 9 (aswell as Pakistan and Bangladesh), evolved from the patriarchal Moghul state which thecolonizing power inherited.’ (Sen: 2009). So, the main features of his theory regarding stateof Bangladesh are as follows –1. State bureaucracy is stronger than the social classes now and long before thesesocieties were colonized that means the state apparatus (Bureaucracy) was over-developed before colonial period2. The state apparatus in most pre-colonial societies was patriarchal and the colonialstate apparatus evolved from the patriarchal Moghul state.3. Historically the state bureaucracy of Bangladesh still bears its pre-colonial andcolonial roots.Emajuddin Ahmed: Another scholar, Dr. Emajuddin Ahmed discussed onBureaucratic Elites in Bangladesh on his PhD dissertation. Mainly his dissertation based onthe study to analyze the nature of the dominant bureaucratic elites in Bangladesh and thedevelopment strategy they have been pursuing.He argues in his study that the ideal relationship between the general public and theirleaders, as these civil servants see it, does not differ very much from the colonial pattern.(Ahmed: 1980). He also said the existing administrative structure and the institutionalframework were built long ago by the British in colonial India with a view to achieving theirlimited ends, and these institutions served them well. (Ahmed: 1980). By following thearguments of Dr. Emajuddin Ahmed, the nature of Bureaucracy in Bangladesh would be –1. The relationships among general public, their leaders and civil servants (Bureaucrats)are colonial in nature.2. The present Bureaucratic framework is similar as administration in colonialBangladesh.A.T.M. Obaidullah: According to him, ‘Since Bangladesh does not have, as yet, acomposite and unified civil service law as in other countries, the various rules, regulations,manuals, and circulars have the effect of law and government departments as obliged tofollow these rules in discharging their day to day administration.These various statutory and non-statutory rules provide detailed guidelines onrecruitment, promotion, and disciplinary action and employee welfare.’(Obaidullah:1999). Inthe question of promotion, he argues that In respect of promotion and career opportunitiesdiscrimination on political consideration happens to be so conspicuous that denies thefundamental rights guaranteed in the constitution.’ (Obaidullah: 1999). ‘After 21 years ofindependence the promotion process of 654 officials to the various posts of BangladeshSecretariat in 1992 overtly manifested the authoritarian attitude and political bias of thegovernment in place of impartiality and objectivity, not tarnished the essence of meritbureaucracy, but also projected disregard for all statutory or non-statutory rules of the civilservice, and sanctity of the constitution on the top.The civil service of Bangladesh as such is in real precarious conditions, amounts to aspoil system, used in the hands of government for effectuating political purposes of the partyin power. If the civil servants are considered and treated merely as servants of thegovernment instead of the servants of the state/ republic, security guaranteed to them by lawInternational Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 749may be jeopardized by capricious intervention of government with political motive’, heexemplified. (Obaidullah: 1999). In essence, he wanted to illustrate that –1. Bangladesh has no rational bureaucracy as other countries have in a sense of legalpolicy, rules and regulation.2. Absence of impartiality and objectivity in bureaucratic managements.3. UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF STATE BUREAUCRACY INBANGLADESHThe British established their rule in Bengal by defeating Mughol Empire in 1757. Asdescribed by Willem Van Schendel, ‘On a fine June day in 1757 thousands of men werefighting in a mango orchard close to the border of present-day Bangladesh. This battlebecame famous as a turning-point in the history of South Asia. It took place in the smallvillage of Polashi, and the encounter established the British East India Company as the newterritorial overlord over Bengal. Within a century this trading conglomerate would capturepractically all of South Asia.Historians have often described the Battle of Polashi as the beginning of Britishcolonial rule in South Asia, a rule that would last till 1947’. (Willem: 2009). And Bangladeshbecame free containing constitutional law; secularism, socialism, democracy and nationalismfrom Pakistani colony by Liberation War in 1971 after the partition of Indian sub-continentinto India and Pakistan in 1947. For handling British rule properly, they established anadministrative structure by following Mughol patriarchal bureaucracy which is remaining inthe characteristics of post-colonial bureaucracy of Bangladesh.Before the industrialization in Europe, British were driven by patrimonial bureaucracyas mentioned by Max Weber. They introduced the same bureaucratic structure (as apparatusof Plato’s ideal state) in Indian-subcontinent for ensuring proper taxation only.The authority of tax collection of Zamindar (Landlord) was given by the state, theyhave no own authority to doing this. They were only the servants of state; state didn’t servethem as western Landlord served by their state. That’s why, after feudalism, westernBourgeoisie was able to emerged rational bureaucracy during industrialization. But it was nothappened in Indian sub-continent.Even in post-colonial Bangladesh, there is no any dominant class who can materializethe state bureaucracy to establish their well-being. In that sense, the interpretations of statebureaucracy in Bangladesh by Hamza Alavi and Anupam Sen are quite applicable;Indigenous bourgeoisie are underdeveloped and state bureaucracy is autonomous as well asstate bureaucracy is stronger than the social classes now and long before these societieswere colonized.Maw Weber identified precise distinguishes between Patrimonial and RationalBureaucracy by observing Europe and Asian societies. Dr. Aupam Sen specified thatdifferentiation by following ways which can be presented in a table (Sen: 1999) –50Volume 7Patrimonial BureaucracyRational Bureaucracy1.

Have significant role in thedevelopment of CapitalismAfter the liberation war, in independent (post-colonial) Bangladesh, has a clear-cutrecruitment policy which is established for rationalizing bureaucracy on the basis of legalauthority. But what is the real scene exist in nature. It will be clear by understanding state andbureaucratic nature in this country. In Democratic system in Bangladesh, Politicians claim forpower is based on popular mandate while that of bureaucrats on merit, competence andpolitical backing. (Anisuzzaman: 2012). One the other hand, politician need to pursue forgetting nomination for election to the bureaucrats. According to Zafarullah, ‘Bureaucrats canhave considerable impact on governance because of their ability to mobilize political supportand to apply or deny their administrative skills and technical expertise’. (Zafarullah: 1992).He also added that it (Bureaucracy) is no longer the neutral instrument of policyimplementation in the hands of politicians.’ (Zafarullah: 1992). But in western bureaucracystill remains structurally subordinate to politics. (Ahmed: 2009). In that context, thetheoretical explanation of Hamza Alavi is right; the state bureaucracy of Bangladesh isautonomous. In the question of rational bureaucracy, P.K. Agrawal stated that any personwho enters the bureaucratic organization now wants to know what his authority is as regardshis domain of activities. Authority tends to power; power breeds ego; and ego createsfavoritism. …the ego may be different for different persons according to the environment.Therefore, ego though purely an internal factor gets liked with external factorscomprising family and kinship, caste and religion, language and region, social economicstrata….. this leads to inaction legalized in many way. (Agrawal: 1995). But in Bangladesh,persons enter into bureaucracy by pursuing others not on the basis on merit always. This isdefined the characteristics of nepotism in public administration in Bangladesh.According to Jacoby, ‘He (Weber) considered official administrative activity asseparated from the private sphere of life, and as a condition which had developed over a longperiod of time.’ (Jacoby: 1976). But in Bangladesh, official administrations are not free fromprivate sphere of bureaucrat’s life. Still it is difficult for Bangladesh to keep out from suchkinds of patriarchy nature of Bureaucracy.The common features of Bangladesh BureaucracyIn essence, the nature of Bureaucracy in Bangladesh shaped by irrational dominationhistorically. In independent Bangladesh, Politicization of Bureaucracy as well as corruptionin state bureaucracy emerged tremendously. According to Ishtiaq Jamil, `Bureaucracy inBangladesh is now caught in the tug-of-war between the major political parties, especially theparty and their allies in power. Their transfer and posting to suitable locations and positions,their promotion, and career are now decided on the basis of their political loyalty. TheInternational Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 751process of manipulating the career of bureaucrats has also led to the division amongbureaucrats along party lines. He also added that, ‘Political connections are now consideredvital for promotion, transfer, posting and even recruitment’. (Jamil: 2007). In a recent studyon `State of bureaucracy in Bangladesh and its reform’, Shahidujjaman Khan elicited that thebureaucracy in the country badly suffered due to politicization of the administration. Hefound that promotions and transfers of the civil servants in the past were entirely on politicalconsiderations and a large number of officers, having requisite qualifications, were deprivedof due promotions, which created a commotion in the civil administration.He also added that `Bureaucracy has, indeed, a sweeping dominance in the stateadministration of Bangladesh. The neutrality of the bureaucracy is critically threatenedbecause of undue influence by the political leaders. Such situation contributes to theunfairness and poor distribution of public service, which tends to boost the practices ofcorruption, collusion and nepotism.’ (Khan: 2012). He finds out three kinds of problems withBangladesh's bureaucracy –First, as per Transparency International (TI) reports, Bangladesh is among the mostcorrupt countries in the world. The performance of the bureaucracy in Bangladesh isranked the world's worst, along with those of India and Vietnam.Second, there are problems with the overlapping structure of bureaucracy, vaguedivisions between government functions and citizen obligations, and unclear politicalprocess of policy formulation.Third, there are problems with human resources quality.Khan clearly mentioned that `Bangladesh inherited the system of bureaucracy from theBritish that ruled Indian subcontinent for over 200 years. The UK government has reformedthe bureaucracy by completely transforming its civil service, making it more accountable toordinary citizens. Some other countries went for drastic reform of their civil administration.Since independence, Bangladesh has had at least 18 proposals for reform in the bureaucracy.Unfortunately, none of these proposals was materialized.’ (Khan: 2012)By considering the theoretical explanation of Bureaucracy and above discussion, wecan summarize the features of state bureaucracy in Bangladesh in the given ways–Measures ofdistinctiveness ofBureaucracyLegal Framework(Management byrules):Legal Rational BureaucracyBureaucracy in BangladeshA bureaucracy follows a consistent Bangladesh has no compositeset of rules that control the and unified rule offunctions of the organization. management in BureaucracyManagement controls the lower yet.

But, there are someoutward characteristics manifested in its framework which is the expression of rationalizingbureaucracy. In particular, documentation, accountability, recruitment policy, hierarchy anddivision of labors of state bureaucracy of Bangladesh are legalized visibly. The skill ofbureaucrats in this state is questionable, where skilled managerial body was the preconditionof Weber’s ideal type of bureaucracy on the basis of legal authority.On the other hand, the theoretical explanations of Hamza Alavi and Anupam Sen aremore applicable to understand the state nature and bureaucratic characteristics of Bangladesh.Eventually, before and after independence, Bangladesh faced military rule in several times. Itcaused the military influence in its bureaucratic organization.International Letters of Social and Humanistic Sciences Vol. 753References<ref>[1] Tumpf, S.E. 1975.
