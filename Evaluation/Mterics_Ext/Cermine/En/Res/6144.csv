It identifies potential benefits and risks of unrestrict-ed foreign investment in Croatian real estate, and attendant dilemmasfor economic policies. The main conclusion is that Croatia stands tobenefit in the long run from foreign investment in the property sector.However, a gradual approach to the opening-up of the real estate mar-ket to non-residents can be justified on a number of grounds. Theseinclude inadequate legislation limiting property speculation; potentialspillovers of price increases from the market for secondary residences* The views expressed here are those of the author and do not necessarily represent thoseof the Bank for International Settlements.

This paper addresses four issues that have attractedparticular attention: How quickly should EU residents get unrestrictedaccess to Croatia’s property market? How will this affect – or is thisalready affecting – the local housing market? What will be the impacton Croatia’s tourism? And what are the likely macroeconomic effectsof foreign investment inflows into Croatia’s real estate? As is often thecase, serious research has yet to catch up with the enormous publicinterest in these issues. This paper is therefore a first attempt to analysethe issues in a systematic manner and provide guidance for future workin this area. The main purpose is to stimulate analysis and policy think-ing on these important issues ahead of the upcoming accession negoti-ations with the EU.Section 2 analyses Croatia’s obligations under Chapter 4 of theacquis, Freedom of movement of capital, paying particular attention tothe right of EU residents to invest in real estate in candidate countries,and discusses Croatia’s current regime for property sales to foreigners.The current regime is rather restrictive, non-transparent and cumber-some in some respects, but relatively liberal in others. However, a moreimportant issue is that this regime will eventually have to be aban-doned, thus exposing the economy to potentially large-scale foreignproperty investments. For under EU law, EU citizens have unrestrictedmihaljek.qxd22.3.200512:00Page 187187rights to buy as much property as they like in any EU country withoutany need to reside in that country. This means that non-residents willnot be restricted to buying only secondary residences as at present, butwill also be able to buy property for speculative purposes, againstwhich there is currently only weak protection in the Croatian legisla-tion. Against this background, Section 2 investigates how Croatia canimprove its negotiating position on this issue. Drawing on the experi-ence of Denmark and Malta, the section highlights the importance ofthe expertise and negotiating skills of officials engaged in accessiontalks with the EU. It notes, however, the difficulty of articulating theview that EU residents should not be allowed to acquire property inCroatia for an extended period of time, and the importance of strength-ening legislation to protect against property speculation.Section 3 analyses potential implications of foreign investmentin real estate for the local housing market. It discusses the main charac-teristics of Croatia’s real estate market and reviews recent develop-ments in housing prices. It finds some empirical evidence that increaseddemand for secondary residences by foreigners has led to an increase inprices of houses and land for construction on the Adriatic. It also analy-ses factors that might determine the effects of foreign property invest-ment on the housing market in the future. These effects will depend onthe speed with which the property market is liberalised; capacity con-straints and competition in the construction industry; the speed withwhich legal impediments to property sales are removed; and develop-ments in household incomes, housing finance and other factors influ-encing the affordability of housing. Given the likely supply rigidities,the section argues that a gradual approach to the opening of the realestate market to non-residents would allow for a more orderly adjust-ment than a rapid removal of restrictions.Section 4 considers how increased foreign investment in realestate could influence Croatia’s tourism industry. To provide insightsinto this question, the section analyses the size and main features ofCroatia’s tourism industry. The question that seems particularly rele-vant in this context is whether accession to the EU offers the opportu-nity for tourism to assume a leading role in overall economic develop-ment, or represents a threat to one of its main assets, the unspoilt coastalenvironment. On balance, Croatian tourism stands to benefit from for-eign property investment. The key will be to avoid the risk of overde-velopment, that is, to ensure strict enforcement of existing building reg-ulations and of the recently adopted legislation on the protection on themihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 188188public coastal domain. Greater foreign ownership of secondary resi-dences could increase the attractiveness of the Adriatic coast andislands for other tourists and over the longer term perhaps contribute tothe economic and demographic revival of many now dormant or aban-doned communities.Section 5 analyses diverse macroeconomic effects thatincreased foreign investment in real estate would have for the Croatianeconomy. The wealth effect has already been in evidence for sometime, as the value of houses and land in areas that are attracting foreignbuyers has increased considerably over the past few years. Due topotentially large capital inflows associated with non-resident realestate purchases, the section elaborates several arguments for a grad-ual opening-up of the market.Section 6 summarises the main conclusions and elaborates anumber of policy recommendations.FREE MOVEMENT OF CAPITALThe EU internal market is based on the principle of the “fourfreedoms” of movement: of goods, services, capital and people. As ageneral rule, the EU is not willing to accept candidate countries'requests to limit these freedoms because this could have a significantimpact on competition and the functioning of the internal market.Croatia – as all EU candidates before it – will thus have to allow basi-cally unrestricted movement of goods, services, capital and people bythe time it accedes to the EU. The Treaty Establishing the EuropeanCommunity (Article 56) prohibits in particular all restrictions on move-ment of capital between member states but also between the memberstates and third countries, although certain restrictions in relation tocountries outside the EU can be retained.Freedom of movement of capital is defined in Chapter 4 of theacquis communitaire. It covers not only payments and transfers ofmoney across borders, but also transfers of ownership of assets and lia-bilities (such as investments in companies and real estate or portfolioinvestments) and directives on prevention of money laundering. Thispaper discusses only one type of capital movement – the right of EUresidents to purchase real estate in Croatia. Croatia’s obligations in thisregard are currently defined in the Stabilization and AssociationAgreement (SAA), (Article 60, point 2):mihaljek.qxd22.3.200512:00Page 189189“As from the entry into force of this Agreement, Croatiashall authorise, by making full and expedient use of its existing pro-cedures, the acquisition of real estate in Croatia by nationals ofMember States of the European Union, except for areas and matterslisted in Annex VII.i Within four years from the entry into force ofthis Agreement, Croatia shall progressively adjust its legislationconcerning the acquisition of real estate in Croatia by nationals ofthe Member States of the European Union to ensure the same treat-ment as compared to Croatian nationals. At the end of the fourthyear after the entry into force of this Agreement, the Stabilisationand Association Council shall examine the modalities for extendingthese rights to the areas and matters listed in Annex VII.”By the time Croatia joins the EU, the SAA will be supersededby an Accession Treaty. Although the Treaty will be largely based onthe SAA, it may treat a number of issues differently. The whole purposeof accession negotiations is precisely to agree under what conditionsCroatia will accept, apply and administratively and legally implementdifferent chapters of the acquis. Commitments under the SAA regard-ing non-residents’ right to purchase property in Croatia thus can and, asargued in this paper, probably should be re-negotiated in the process ofCroatia’s accession to the EU.What is the current situation regarding the acquisition of realestate in Croatia by non-residents? Private non-resident individuals canalready become owners of real estate in Croatia (other than by inheri-tance) after obtaining permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.They are restricted to one property, which is limited in size (the con-struction site cannot exceed 1,500 m2), and there are areas in whichthey may not acquire property, such as protected natural areas, agricul-tural land, forests and forest land and certain excluded areas.ii Keyissues in the application procedure, which can reportedly take up to ayear, are the approval of the transaction by the Ministry of Justice andthe existence of a reciprocity agreement on real estate purchasesbetween Croatia and a given non-resident’s home country.iii Forinstance, US residents may be granted permission to buy property inCroatia because Croatian citizens can acquire property in the UnitedStates without restriction. In contrast, private individuals from Sloveniacannot acquire property in Croatia because Slovenia and Croatia do nothave a reciprocity agreement in this area.ivAccording to the official data quoted by the news media, 3,200foreign residents have obtained permission to buy real estate in Croatiamihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 190190since 1996, when the property market was first opened to foreigners(Table 1).v Less than 40% of applications have since been approved,7% have been rejected, and over half have not yet been processed.vi Thenumber of applications has varied from around 550 per year during1996-99, to around 1,250 per year since 2000.In addition to private non-resident individuals, non-residents whoset up a Croatian company can also acquire property in Croatia. In thiscase there is no need for government permission to buy the property(although there are various other legal and financial considerations) andthe buyer is not restricted to one piece of property. There is no officialinformation on the number of companies set up for this purpose. However,since establishing a company normally takes much less than one year andis not costly, there are indications that many foreigners (in particular fromcountries such as Slovenia that do not have reciprocity agreements) makeuse of this alternative to acquire real estate in Croatia.viiTable 1 Non-resident applications to buy real estate in Croatia, 1996–20042004 (Jan-Sep)12000–041996–99Total 1996–2004Percent of total, 1996-2004No. ofapplications1,0506,2572,1928,449–Approved222,3819213,20238.1Notapproved104451285737.1Inprocess1,0183,4311,1434,57454.81 New applications only. In addition, 242 applications from previous years wereapproved and 46 rejected in the first nine months of 2004.Sources: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted in Jutarnji list (21 October 2004) andVjesnik (26 October 2004); author’s calculationsThe existing regime for property sales to foreigners can thus becharacterised as relatively restrictive, non-transparent and cumbersomein some respects, but relatively liberal in others. In particular, it is notclear why the processing of applications takes so long and why the cri-teria used in evaluating the applications are not transparent and public.On the other hand, it is important to recognise that current arrange-ments with respect to the sale of property to third country residents arealready more liberal than the EU legislation requires: not just EUnationals, but residents of any country where Croatian citizens have theright to acquire property can in principle become owners of real estatein Croatia. Moreover, residents of virtually any country can buy prop-erty if they register a Croatian company.mihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 191191How will these arrangements change with implementation of theSAA and Croatia’s accession to the EU? The main change is that, uponexpiration of the four-year transitional period agreed in the SAA (orperhaps a longer period yet to be negotiated during accession talks), EUresidents will have the right to buy real estate in Croatia without anyrestriction. This means that they will not be restricted to buying onlysecondary residences or just one piece of property, and will not be sub-ject to other conditions, such as prior approval, size, or use of the prop-erty. Under EU law, EU citizens have full rights to buy as much prop-erty as they like in any EU country without any need to reside in thatcountry. This means that non-residents can also buy property for spec-ulative purposes, unless this is limited by domestic legislation, which islargely not the case in Croatia at present.It is not clear whether these implications of EU accession areclear to the Croatian public and to policy makers. In any case, theyhave not yet been articulated in public discussion. The real issue isthat the existing restrictions on real estate sales to foreigners, how-ever imperfect, will eventually have to be lifted, thus exposing theeconomy to foreign property investments of potentially far greatermagnitude than anything that has been observed so far. This raisesthe question of whether the authorities could or should do somethingto keep the existing restrictions in place for more than four years, andhow to better protect in the meantime against property speculation.viiiAt present, commercially motivated property sales in the sec-ondary market are subject to income tax only if the sale occurs with-in three years from the purchase of the property. Part of the capitalgains from such sales is not taxed.ix There seem to be no additionalregulations preventing speculation in the market for land or uncom-pleted property. For instance, an entrepreneur could buy up largeswathes of land for construction, or batches of uncompleted apart-ments and houses, in the expectation that prices will rise rapidly dueto limited supply, and then resell at a higher price. While the entre-preneur would pay the regular profits tax, the tax authorities wouldnot be in a position, as in most mature market economies, to make ajudgement about the fair value of such transactions, and, hence, anyextra profits earned by the entrepreneur due to speculative activity.The lack of capital largely prevents Croatian citizens from engagingin such activities at the moment, so the weakness of anti-speculativeregulations may not be obvious. But once the property market isopened up to non-residents, the lack of capital will no longer con-mihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 192192strain this type of activities, and the weakness of the legislation couldmanifest itself very quickly, resulting in the meantime in potentiallylarge disruptions in local property markets. The remainder of thissection considers only the first issue – whether the authorities couldor should do something to keep in place the existing restrictions onproperty sales to non-residents. The issue of anti-speculative legisla-tion requires a separate expert analysis that goes beyond the scope ofthe present paper.How have other candidate countries handled the issue of transi-tional periods for real estate purchases in their accession negotiations?The biggest issue in most cases turned out to be the right to purchaseland. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania andSlovakia requested 10-18 year moratoria on the sales of land to EU res-idents (Table 2). They justified the need for moratoria by several socialand economic factors, including the high share of the population work-ing in agriculture; underdeveloped land markets; significantly lowerland prices in candidate countries than in the EU-15; and substantiallylower average income of domestic population relative to EU nationals,which would give EU nationals an unfair advantage in purchasing agri-cultural land in new member states.xRecognising the high political sensitivity of this issue, theEuropean Commission proposed in May 2001 that the candidate coun-tries should be allowed to limit the acquisition of agricultural land byother EU nationals during a transitional period of seven years after theiraccession to the EU (European Commission, 2001a).xi During this peri-od, the candidate countries would have to use objective, stable, trans-parent and public criteria for the authorisation procedures for landacquisitions. The Commission also proposed a review, to take placeafter three years, to determine whether this transitional period could beshortened or even lifted.The Commission’s proposal was perceived as a trade-off on abroader issue of far greater importance to the EU-15, that is, betweenthe demand of the EU-15 for 5-7 year transition periods for the freemovement of workers from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), andthe candidates’ demand for longer transition periods for land pur-chases by non-residents. Most candidate countries endorsed andeventually adopted the Commission’s proposal (Table 2). The onlyexception was Poland, which insisted on a longer transition periodfearing that foreign residents might buy relatively cheaply its abun-dant reserves of agricultural land. As Poland has by far the largestmihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 193193population among the new member states and at the same time therewere fears in some old members of the EU that Polish workers mightcrowd out domestic labour after the accession, the Polish authoritiesmanaged to negotiate a 12-year moratorium on land purchases bynon-residents in exchange for a seven-year transition period for thefree movement of Polish workers to most EU countries.xii Most coun-tries also negotiated the possibility to extend the seven-year transi-tional period by another three years if a special safeguard clause isinvoked.The right of EU nationals to purchase secondary residences incandidate countries was considerably less controversial. Cyprus, theCzech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia requested five-year transition-al periods, mostly citing concerns about the impact of large-scale realestate purchases by foreign residents on the prices and affordability oflocal housing. The Baltic countries, Bulgaria and Slovenia, allowed EUresidents to purchase secondary residences even before their accessiontalks and therefore requested no transitional arrangements at all,although Slovenia negotiated the right to invoke a general economicsafeguard clause to protect its real estate sector over a period of sevenyears. Against this background, it is interesting that some media report-ed a different interpretation of Slovenia’s position, according to whichSlovenia tried but did not manage to negotiate a transitional period forreal estate purchases.xiiiThe European Commission’s proposal for a five-year transi-tional period for secondary residences was eventually adopted by allnew member states except Malta, which presented a special problem.Malta’s case is instructive and deserves particular attention becauseof some similarities on this issue with the current situation in Croatia(see Box 1).Another interesting example is Denmark. Foreigners are free tobuy real estate in Denmark for business and primary residence purpos-es (subject to certain residency restrictions), but not as secondaryhomes. In particular, foreigners cannot own holiday homes along theDanish coast – such properties can only be rented out. This restrictiondates back to the mid-1960s, when Denmark was not yet in the EU andthere were fears that foreigners might buy holiday properties on thecoast for speculative purposes. To prevent speculation, non-residentswere not allowed to own vacation homes that are kept unoccupied mostof the year. Upon accession in 1973, Denmark was allowed to keep thisrestriction.xivmihaljek.qxd22.3.200512:00Page 194194Table 2 Candidate country positions on acquisition of real estate byEuropean Union nationals1CountrySecondary residencesAgricultural and forestry landCountry’snegotiatingpositionTransitionalarrangementagreed with EUCountry’snegotiatingpositionTransitionalarrangementagreed with EUBulgariaCyprusCzech RepublicEstoniaHungaryLatviaLithuaniaMaltaPolandRomaniaSlovakiaSlovenia02550250202P7–9–950255505600P8550S1110N 4100 210100 2N 41815 10100 67 3N 47 3,57 3,57 3,57 3,57 3,5N 4127 37 3,5S 111 Delay (years after accession to the EU) in the right of EU nationals to acquire sec-ondary residences and agricultural and forestry land in candidate countries.2 No transitional periods or derogations requested.3 Excluding self-employed farmers.4 Cyprus and Malta were not required to liberalise land acquisition due to the verysmall size of agricultural and forestry land.5 Possibility to extend transitional period by 3 years if the country invokes safeguardclause.6 Excluding EU and EFTA residents residing in country for at least 4 years.7 Permanent derogation of the acquisition of secondary residences by non-residentsand of real estate for speculative purposes.8 Permanent derogation: only EU nationals residing in Malta for at least 5 years canbuy more than one property on the island.9 No information on the negotiating position available.10 In addition, five-year transition period for the liberalisation of land acquisition insidetown limits.11 Special arrangement: possibility to resort to a general economic safeguard clause for7 years in real estate.Sources: Foreign ministries of new member states;<ref> European Commission (2001);Deutsche Bank Research (2000)In su</ref>mmary, the cases of Malta and Denmark, along with thePolish extension of the period for agricultural land purchases by non-residents, illustrate that the scope for adopting solutions suiting theinterests of candidate countries is not limited ex ante and depends,among other things, on the expertise and negotiating skills of publicservants engaged in accession talks with the EU.xv Nevertheless, onemihaljek.qxd22.3.200512:00Page 195195should not underestimate the difficulty of negotiations on this point.The arguments for either the Maltese or the Danish exemption may notbe easily applied to Croatia. Moreover, as discussed in the conclusion,no country can expect to benefit from the rights of membership if at thesame time it does not want to shoulder the obligations. The challenge inthis particular case will be, first, to identify an important national inter-est (if any) in postponing the liberalisation of the real estate market fornon-residents; and second, to demonstrate that applying unrestrictedrights of EU residents to acquire property in Croatia would go againstthis interest for an extended period of time. One obvious candidate forsuch an interest is the need to limit property speculation. Such a movewould not go against the spirit of EU accession because other EU mem-ber countries have such legislation. The sections that follow elaborateseveral other economic arguments that tend to support the case for amore gradual approach to the liberalisation of the property market.Box 1 How did Malta negotiate an exemption from the com-plete liberalisation of real estate sales to European Unionresidents?As in Croatia, non-residents – including from non-EU coun-tries – could acquire property in Malta even before the country’saccession to the EU. Restrictions on property sales were similar tothose presently used in Croatia – the sale required prior approval,only one secondary residence of limited size could be acquired bynon-residents, and the value of property had to be above a certainlimit. The rationale for these restrictions was to retain a measure ofcontrol on land use and to prevent speculation. Foreigners couldacquire additional property in Malta beyond the secondary resi-dence only if they obtained Maltese nationality.During accession talks, Malta requested to be able to keepthese restrictions on a permanent basis. The authorities were in par-ticular concerned that if EU residents had unrestricted access to thereal estate in their small island country, this could lead to morewidespread economic and social problems. They supported theircase by several well-founded arguments.First, they argued that, with population of 395,000 and ter-ritory of just 316 km2 (by comparison, Croatian islands of Braè andHvar have surface areas of 395 km2 and 300 km2, respectively),Malta was by far the most densely populated country in the EU-25.As a result, land available for construction could only cover thebasic needs of the local population.mihaljek.qxd22.3.200512:00Page 196196Second, they argued that, if the right of EU citizens to buyproperty in Malta after membership led to an increase in demand forproperty, this could affect property prices and have a negative socialimpact on Maltese families, especially on young couples. Whilehousing affordability is not only affected by EU membership – theproperty prices have been rising in Malta for many years – Malta’sconcern was that EU membership should not add to the problem bymaking housing even less affordable.Third, they argued that concerns about housing affordabili-ty in their densely populated country were permanent because,should a problem arise, it would be greater in future than at present,affecting future generations more than the current ones. This is whya transitional period was not sufficient for Malta: only a permanentarrangement was acceptable.The European Commission accepted these arguments andthe EU eventually agreed that Malta may maintain, on a permanentbut non-discriminatory basis, the existing restrictions on the right ofEU citizens to acquire just one secondary residence in Malta.However, after residing in Malta for at least five years, EU citizenswill be allowed to buy additional property beyond the secondaryresidence. The five-year residence requirement was the balance thatwas struck between the two diametrically opposed positions inMaltese and EU law. Under Maltese law, foreigners can never havefull rights to buy property in Malta – that is, to buy property otherthan one secondary residence – unless they obtain Maltese nation-ality. On the other hand, under EU law, EU citizens have full rightsto buy as much property as they like in any EU country without anyneed to reside in that country.Source: Busuttil (2002)IMPLICATIONS FOR CROATIA’S REALESTATE MARKETTo understand the broader economic implications of a more lib-eral regime for the acquisition of property by foreigners, it is necessaryfirst to consider some basic features of the real estate market in Croatia.One should note from the outset that there is very little publishedresearch on the economics of the Croatian property market.xviMoreover, statistical data on the real estate market are very patchy.mihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 197197Given the many transformations of this market (for instance, fromstate-owned, to company- and socially-owned, to privately-ownedhousing) and institutional differences with western European and for-mer socialist countries, an empirical research programme on the eco-nomics of the real estate market would be extremely useful forresearchers, policy makers and the real estate industry. This section canin no way fill this gap; it will only attempt to outline those features ofthe real estate market that might be relevant in the course of Croatia’sEU accession.The real estate market is usually one of the most closely watchedsectors in mature market economies. It plays a crucial role not onlybecause housing accounts for the bulk of the personal wealth, but alsobecause of linkages with key investment, saving, and consumptionchoices of households and businesses. In addition, the real estate mar-ket affects competitiveness as a major input in the productive capacity,in particular in service oriented economies such as Croatia’s, and as animportant determinant of banking and equity market performance, bothof which are highly affected by movements in property prices.The real estate market in Croatia is still relatively small – con-struction and real estate industries account for around 13% of GDP,compared with 20-25% of GDP in many industrial countries, indicatingconsiderable potential for future growth. The real estate market startedto develop in earnest in the second half of the 1990s, after most of thehousing and commercial property stock inherited from the socialistperiod had been privatised. Privatisation of housing led to an increasein the already high proportion of both privately-owned and owner-occupied housing. According to the 2001 Census, 96% of the 1.4 mil-lion permanently occupied dwellings in Croatia are owned by privateindividuals, and 83% are owner-occupied dwellings.xvii For compari-son, in western Europe the share of housing owned by private individ-uals ranges from about 60% in Austria and Sweden to 90-95% inBelgium, Greece, Spain and Portugal; while the share of owner-occu-pied housing ranges from 38% in Germany to 80% in Ireland (OECD,2001).xviii Croatia is in this respect similar to some other CEE countries,where privatisation has also resulted in a high level of owner-occupiedhousing.xixThere is little reliable information about the state of the housingstock in Croatia. Comparing the total number of households (1.48 mil-lion) with the number of permanently occupied dwellings indicates asmall deficit in the housing stock (about 56,000 dwellings in 2001).xxmihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 198198However, if one considers the additional stock of about 200,000dwellings that are temporarily unoccupied, the number of dwellingsexceeds the number of households by about 10%.xxiThe picture on the regional distribution of the housing stock isalso unclear. The Ministry of Environmental Protection, PhysicalPlanning and Construction (MZOUP, 2003:35) argues that there is a sig-nificant shortage of housing in middle-sized and large cities, and at thesame time a significant surplus of housing in small towns. Large differ-ences in apartment prices between cities such as Zagreb and Karlovacwould tend to support this view. However, Tica (2004) argues that iftemporarily unoccupied dwellings are counted, all Croatian counties,including the city of Zagreb, have a surplus in the housing stock.Regarding housing supply, defined here as the flow of newhousing (the “primary” market) plus sales of existing homes (the “sec-ondary” market), the available data suggest that supply in the primarymarket is relatively tight. During 1996-2001, about 13,600 dwellingswere on average completed each year.xxii To compare this figure withjust one segment of the potential demand for housing, there were onaverage 70% more marriages (about 23,000) each year during this peri-od. In international comparison, with an average of 3 newly completeddwellings per 1,000 inhabitants during 1996-2001, Croatia is near thebottom relative to western Europe, although it compares favourablywith other central and eastern European countries (Figure 1).Figure 1 Newly completed dwellings per 1,000 inhabitantsIRPTSPGRAT CRO SLO CR ITHU SVK ROBGData for Croatia: 1996-2001 average; for western European countries: 2000; for centraland eastern Europe: 1998.Sources: Central Bureau of Statistics (Croatia), OECD (2002), CIRIEC (2002).14 13.212108642010.89.18.26.83.0 3.02.1 2.0 2.0 1.41.1 0.8mihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 199199Although there are no comprehensive data on sales in the sec-ondary market, the available indicators suggest that the supply is con-strained in this market as well. Perhaps the most important reason isthat many properties – including many of those temporarily unoccupied– do not have clean titles, so many potential trades cannot be realised.As discussed below, this state of affairs is due to huge backlogs in thejudiciary, the often chaotic state of property registers and deficienciesin urban planning and the enforcement of building relations.Furthermore, much of the housing stock has been privatised tooccupiers for nominal payments or at no cost. Privatisation thus result-ed in windfall gains according to who happened to be living in adwelling at the time. Many people therefore occupy dwellings that theywould not otherwise be in a position to afford. Such properties are notlikely to be offered for sale, which limits the effective supply.The third reason is that standards of construction were oftenpoor, resulting in problems with the quality of many existing dwellings.According to the 2001 Census, one-third of Croatia’s housing stock isolder than 45 years (i.e., constructed up to 1960); 60% was constructedbetween 1961 and 1990; and only 8% since 1991. From an investmentpoint of view, the amortisation period for buildings is usually 50 years,so the bulk of the housing stock in Croatia is close to or past its usefullife. This also means that privatisation has saddled many occupiers withliabilities in the form of high maintenance obligations.Finally, as part of the economic transformation, the public sectorhas largely pulled out of the housing construction business, while privatefirms have not yet expanded sufficiently to bridge the gap in all segmentsof the market. In particular, the financial problems of the public sectorhave resulted in a sharp decline in the construction of social housing.On the basis of these observations, one can form a workinghypothesis that the supply of housing is presently tight in both primaryand secondary markets. The question is, then, what is the likely impactof growing demand for vacation homes by foreigners on the residentialproperty market? In particular, how realistic are fears, often expressedin the public, that rising prices of summer vacation homes along theAdriatic coast could spill over to the local housing market and negative-ly affect the affordability of housing for ordinary Croatian households?The potentially most important channel for the transmission ofprice increases from the market for secondary residences to the residen-tial housing market is the expectations channel. As with all assets, cur-rent prices of real estate depend on expectations of future prices. Thehousing market seems to be tight at the moment, so price increases inmihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 200200the market for secondary residences are likely to be rapidly transmittedto other segments of the market. Most relevant in this context is themarket situation on the Adriatic coast and islands, where most of theproperty sales to foreigners are taking place. The number of permanentdwellings on the coast and islands was 355,000 in 2001.xxiii In addition,Croatians owned on the Adriatic about 118,000 vacation homes in2001, which represented two-thirds of the total number of such homesin Croatia. Thus, vacation homes are already a key segment of the hous-ing market on the Adriatic, accounting for a quarter of the total housingstock in this region. Moreover, domestic and international media indi-cate growing interest of foreigners in buying property on the Adriatic,including for investment purposes.xxiv According to the news media,prices of houses and land for construction have risen by 20-30% overthe past two years, and by 50-100% in most attractive locations such asthe old city of Dubrovnik.xxvGiven the relative size of this market segment and of reportedprice increases, it is conceivable that rising prices of summer vacationhomes and of land for construction could, as postulated above, spillover to the housing market for local residents and affect house pricesand affordability. Yet in the primary market there is no evidence to sub-stantiate these concerns. The average prices of newly completed apart-ments declined sharply after a run-up in 1999, and their growthremained negative during 2000 and 2001 (Figure 2). In 2003, pricesincreased only in Zagreb (by about 10%), while in the first half of 2004,prices of newly completed apartments declined in all locations.Figure 2 Average prices of completed apartments (HRK/m2, annual percentagechange)302520151050-5-1095969798990001020304:H1TotalZagrebOther areasSource: Central Bureau of Statisticsmihaljek.qxd22.3.200512:00Page 201201Data on sales of existing homes and land for construction pro-vide more support for the spillover hypothesis. Between March andNovember 2004, house prices on the Adriatic increased at an annualrate of 10%, and prices of land for construction at an annual rate of 30%(Table 3). At the same time, house prices in Zagreb increased muchmore rapidly, while apartment prices on the Adriatic actually fell, indi-cating that property prices are also under strong influence of factorsother than non-resident demand for vacation properties. Nevertheless,rising prices of houses and land for construction on the Adriatic reflectat least in part expectations about the future demand of foreign buyers.This is also confirmed by anecdotal evidence.xxvi More importantly, ris-ing prices of land for construction can be interpreted as a leading indi-cator of future increases in house prices on the Adriatic.Given the lack of comprehensive statistical data on propertysales in the secondary market, the above results need to be interpretedwith caution. Data used to construct Table 3 come from a commercialsource, which publishes data at weekly frequency and with a relativelydetailed breakdown. However, these data do not cover all propertiesoffered for sale, and only indicate prices that are being asked by sellersrather than actual transactions prices. Because real estate sales are sub-ject to the value-added tax or the property sales tax, Croatian taxauthorities reportedly maintain a large data base on transactions in thesecondary market.xxvii However, these data are not published, nor havethey been made available to researchers.Table 3 Real estate prices, November 20041HousesApartmentsLand for constructionEUR/m2Growth rate2(annualpercentagechange)CroatiaZagrebAdriaticCroatiaZagrebAdriatic1,1001,4381,09610.522.510.41,4661,5161,4024.511.1-3.3431283226.518.730.31 Average prices based on 1,267 properties offered for sale on 4 November 2004.2 Estimated from linear regressions (ln price = const + b*ln time + e) of weekly datafrom 10 March 2004 to 4 November 2004.Source: Jutarnji list, weekly supplements Real estate (based on www.burza-nekretni-na.com); author’s calculationsThe Croatian Bureau of Statistics only publishes data on averageprices of newly completed apartments, on a quarterly basis and withmihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 202202considerable delay (these data were used in Figure 2). The news media,on the other hand, suffer from sample bias: they tend to focus on prop-erties in exceptional locations, often bought by domestic and interna-tional celebrities. The prices of such properties do not characterise gen-eral trends in the housing market, but they nevertheless affect marketsentiment and sellers’ expectations, which is reflected in figures report-ed in Table 3 and has also been reported by market participants. Forinstance, many real estate agents consider prices of properties offeredfor sale to be overvalued by about 30% on average.xxviiiLooking ahead, will the current conditions of relatively tighthousing supply and rising prices of at least some houses and land forconstruction ease or become more pronounced with the opening-up ofthe market to non-residents? And what role will the speed of liberalisa-tion play in this process?Arguments supporting the view that pressures on the local prop-erty market might intensify fall into three categories. First, the numberof properties sold to foreigners has been small to date. As noted above,since 1996 only about 3,200 property sales to foreigners have beenapproved. Even if the true number of realised sales is twice as high (dueto provisions that allow foreigners to buy property via registered com-panies), this would represent less than 2% of the stock of permanenthousing on the Adriatic (5% of the stock of summer vacation homes).Such a small market segment clearly cannot influence the overall realestate market. In the future, however, foreign demand for secondaryresidences is likely to be much higher, and might therefore have a moresignificant impact on developments in the housing market. As ofSeptember 2004, real estate brokers estimated the number of potentialsales already in the pipeline at about 10,000 houses.xxix This is equiva-lent to 75% of the average annual supply of new housing in the entirecountry. A demand shock of this size would clearly have a big impacton the local housing market, even if the sales were realised over a peri-od of 2-3 years.The second concern relates to construction costs. If the construc-tion industry is operating at full capacity, increased demand for vaca-tion homes by non-residents will put pressure on housing constructioncosts in the short run, which will spill over to the market for permanenthousing. To the extent that the construction industry is not competitive,the increase in costs – and hence the spillover on the local housing mar-ket – will be so much the higher. One should note that in the long runhousing supply is elastic with respect to both income and price, somihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 203203capacity in the construction industry is not likely to be a factor con-straining the supply of housing. But cost spillovers may be present inthe short run and affect expectations of future prices, in particular ifthere is a sudden increase in demand.The third concern is that for an average family the affordabilityof housing is already low, so that any spillover of price increases andconstruction costs due to the opening-up of the property market to for-eigners might make housing even less affordable for the local popula-tion. However, concerns about affordability relate primarily to access tohousing finance and public housing policy, and have little to do withnon-residents’ demand for vacation properties (see Box 2).The main argument supporting the view that demand from non-residents will not affect future supply and price of local housing is thatlegal uncertainties relating to property transactions will be graduallyremoved as Croatia approaches membership in the EU and starts imple-menting the acquis communitaire. As noted above, many propertiesdesired by foreign as well as domestic buyers do not have clean titles,so many potential trades have not been realised. In such circumstancesit is not surprising that properties with clean title fetch higher prices.More importantly, legal uncertainty is presently constraining the poten-tial supply of permanent housing in the secondary market. Clean prop-erty titles and orderly and more efficient cadastres will most likelybring many houses, apartments and pieces of land that are currentlywithheld from it onto the market, including some of the 200,000 tem-porarily unoccupied dwellings mentioned above.The speed with which the property market is opened up to non-residents can tip the balance of these forces in an important way.Keeping restrictions on foreign ownership in place might sustain rela-tively high prices by limiting the supply of vacation properties to non-residents. However, the prices of such properties and real estate in gen-eral are bound to increase anyway with rising incomes in the longrun.xxx The issue is then, how fast will prices of vacation properties con-verge to their long-term equilibrium? Given the apparent interest of for-eigners in the Croatian property market, it is likely that a rapid removalof restrictions would lead to a large increase in demand for secondaryresidences, while at the same time the supply response would be lesselastic due to legal constraints and limited capacity in constructionindustry. This would, ceteris paribus, imply faster convergence to long-run equilibrium prices, but with potentially significant spillovers ontothe local housing market along the way. On the other hand, a moremihaljek.qxd22.3.200512:00Page 204204gradual removal of restrictions would allow more time for the supply torespond to foreign demand, thereby limiting price increases in the shortrun and lowering costs of adjustment to the long-run equilibrium.Box 2 Affordability of housing, housing finance and publichousingContrary to widespread beliefs, the affordability of housinghas not declined in recent years. Except in 1999, net earnings weregrowing faster than average prices of new housing (Figure 3).However, the index of housing affordability is very low in Croatia:an average annual income in 2003 was equivalent to the averageprice of just 5.5 m2 of a newly completed apartment. In other words,one family member would need to put aside his or her entire annu-al income for ten years in order to save enough for a modest 55m2apartment, assuming that average income and apartment pricesgrow at the same rate. Affordability of housing is therefore a legit-imate concern. However, one should not jump to the conclusion thathousing would become more affordable if foreign ownership of realestate was more restricted. Housing affordability depends on manyfactors that have no connection to demand for vacation homes bynon-residents. Two factors that are examined here are housingfinance and public housing policy.Figure 3 House affordabilityeg 25nah 20ceg 15aten 10rec 5plau 0nn -5A9697989900010203Net earnignsNew housing pricesAffordabilityindex (rhs)Source: Central Bureau of Statistics; author’s calulationsAt present, the largest providers of housing finance inCroatia are commercial banks. Housing loans account on average6543210eircp teneag trmr ae pav ap/sgn enwiran folaeunn fsoqmAmihaljek.qxd22.3.200512:00Page 205205for one-third of commercial bank loans to households, which is lowcompared with mature market economies and some new memberstates.xxxi Moreover, housing loans in Croatia are still relativelyexpensive: they are mostly short-term products with a maturity ofless than ten years (although longer-term loans are now being pro-vided by some banks); the loan-to-value ratio is typically lower thanthe standard in advanced market economies; interest rates remaingenerally high both in nominal and real terms (although they havedeclined in recent years); loans provided with a fixed interest rateare still rare; and most loans are provided with a foreign exchangeclause so that households bear the currency risk. Banks justifiedthese practices in the past by the difficulty of enforcing foreclosureof residential properties. However, reforms in legislation and thejudiciary over the past few years have made it easier for creditors toseize properties or attach salaries used as collateral for housingloans.xxxii The fact that the restrictive practices in granting housingloans survive indicates that the housing loan market in Croatia isstill relatively underdeveloped, and access to housing finance diffi-cult for an average family.The relatively high indebtedness of Croatian householdsrepresents a further constraint on housing affordability. In 2003 netearnings of Croatian households amounted to about 65 billion kuna,while outstanding bank loans to households amounted to 55 billionkuna.xxxiii This corresponds to a debt to income ratio of about 84%,which is higher than in the euro area (about 80%). On this basis,there would not seem to be much room for expanding householdindebtedness, although there is considerable room for changing thestructure of household debt toward more housing loans and fewerconsumer loans.What are the other options for improving housing affordabil-ity? Contractual savings and subsidised housing schemes are still rel-atively unimportant in Croatia. In the six years since the first housingsavings banks were established, they made only 9,350 housing loansto a total value of 60 million euros, compared with accumulateddeposits of around 470 million euros in mid-2004.xxxiv Judging fromthe experience of the new EU member states, the success of suchhousing schemes can be attributed largely to state-provided incen-tives. This, however, creates a considerable fiscal burden for the state.In 2003, the government of Hungary was forced to remove most fis-cal incentives for housing, as their cost significantly contributed tothe general government deficit of 9.3% of GDP in the previous year.mihaljek.qxd22.3.200512:00Page 206206Given the pressing need for fiscal consolidation in Croatia, expand-ing subsidies to contractual housing schemes does not seem feasible.Another approach to addressing housing affordability is viapublic housing policy. Even in countries with highly sophisticatedfinancial systems some segments of the population (including thepoor, people who are unable to work, and young couples) do nothave access to housing finance. In Croatia there have been only twolarger public housing schemes in recent years: one targeting handi-capped veterans of the Homeland War; and the so-called POSscheme of public subsidies for housing construction. Under the for-mer scheme, a total of 4,400 apartments have been constructed since1997, with plans for a further 700 units. Under the latter scheme,1,500 apartments have been constructed since 2000 and 8,000 moreare being planned.xxxv The POS scheme has been criticised, howev-er, for poor targeting (see Tica, 2002). In particular, many poorerhouseholds are not in a position to qualify for the scheme due to rel-atively high down payments (over 100% of average annual incomefor an apartment of 50m2) and debt servicing costs (about 30% ofaverage income).xxxvi Taxpayers’ money may thus have been used toassist the relatively better-off households, rather than the economi-cally disadvantaged ones, to acquire low-cost housing.A broader implication of this situation, rarely articulated inpublic discussions, is that the current younger generation finds itmuch more difficult to acquire own housing than the older genera-tions. Under the socialist system, housing was for the most part pro-vided by the public sector or labour-managed enterprises. Evenafter this practice was abandoned in the 1980s and families had toturn to the banks for housing loans, conditions for obtaining loanswere comparatively benign. The state-owned banks extended hous-ing loans with very long maturities, no required collateral or rela-tively small down payments, and at very favourable fixed interestrates, which significantly reduced the burden of debt service in anenvironment of high inflation.xxxvii This system was, of course,unsustainable especially once the government stopped bailing outthe state-owned commercial banks. Since then, with the exceptionof public sector housing schemes mentioned above, housing loanshave been provided at essentially market terms.xxxviiiIn summary, there is some evidence that increased demand forsecondary homes by non-residents may have already led to an increasein house and land prices on the Adriatic. The future effect will dependmihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 207207on the speed with which the property market is opened up; capacityconstraints and competition in the construction industry; the speed withwhich legal impediments to property sales are removed; and develop-ments in household incomes, housing finance and other factors influ-encing the affordability of housing. In general, however, given the sup-ply rigidities, one could expect that a measured approach to the open-ing of the real estate market to non-residents would allow for a moreorderly adjustment than a rapid removal of restrictions.IMPACT OF EUROPEAN UNION ACCESSIONON CROATIA’S TOURISM INDUSTRYThe preceding sections identified the right of EU nationals toacquire property in Croatia as an important issue in forthcoming accessionnegotiations, and discussed potential implications of foreign investment inreal estate for the local housing market. This section considers how devel-opments on this front might influence Croatia’s tourism industry.As with the real estate market, the lack of rigorous economicanalysis and adequate statistical data on tourism make it difficult toassess even the size and economic potential of this industry, let aloneits dynamics in the context of Croatia’s accession to the EU. One of thefew analytical studies available is a report by the World Travel andTourism Council (2004), which uses the methodology of tourism satel-lite accounts (TSA), developed by the OECD and the World TourismOrganization in the 1990s.xxxix This methodology aims at identifyingmore precisely different industries supplying the tourism output, andthus offers policy makers better insights into economic and othereffects of tourism (see Annex).The TSA methodology clearly indicates that travel and tourismis a key economic activity in Croatia: its contribution to GDP in 2003is estimated at 28% ($8 billion), and to total employment at 21%(294,000 jobs) (Table 4).xl The bulk of this contribution ($4.6 billion,equivalent to 16% of GDP) comes from spending by international vis-itors on goods and services (so-called visitor exports). In terms ofnational accounts, travel and tourism contribute 44% of total exports,absorb 19% of total imports; and account for 11% of personal con-sumption and 11% of capital investment.In international comparison, Croatia ranks 22nd among morethan 160 countries in terms of the share of travel and tourism in GDPmihaljek.qxd22.3.200512:00Page 208208(well ahead of Austria, Greece, Italy, Switzerland and new memberstates from central Europe); 16th in terms of the share of travel andtourism in total employment (behind Turkey, but well ahead of thecountries mentioned above); and 13th in terms of the share of travel andtourism exports in total exports. However, in terms of governmentexpenditure on tourism, Croatia lags far behind: national and local gov-ernment agencies in Austria, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary,Italy and Switzerland spend between 3,5% and 7,5% of their totalexpenditure on tourism-related services, compared with just 1% inCroatia. This seems far too low, because local government initiatives(for instance, promotion of agro-tourism in Istria) can broaden the spec-trum of services offered, increase tourist expenditure and perhapsextend the tourist season. The report sees strong growth prospects forCroatia’s travel and tourism industry, which is projected to expand bynearly 7% per annum over the next ten years, much faster than eitherEU or world-wide demand for tourism.Table 4 Tourism Satellite Account for Croatia, 2003In billions of USDIn percent of GDP23.35.71.81.10.60.015.94.20.22.21.827.5101121Travel and tourismconsumptionPersonalBusinessCorporateGovernmentGovernment expenditure– travel and tourism servicesSpending by visitors(visitor exports)Travel and tourism demandGovernment expenditure– collective servicesCapital investmentOther (non-visitor exports)TotalEmploymentDirectly in travel and tourismEconomy-wideTotal6.71.60.50.30.80.04.61.20.10.60.57.9139155294In thousandsof employedPercent of totalemploymentSources: World Travel and Tourism Council (2004); author’s calculationsmihaljek.qxd22.3.200512:00Page 209209The question that arises against this background is to whatextent the expected increase in investment in Croatian real estate byresidents of the EU might change the outlook for and the character oftravel and tourism industry over the medium term. One issue that seemsparticularly relevant in this context is whether accession to the EUoffers the opportunity for tourism to assume a leading role in overalleconomic development, or represents the threat to what is widely con-sidered to be the last remaining environmentally unspoiled area of theMediterranean within easy reach of major European cities. To addressthese issues, it is necessary first to consider the main features of tourismin Croatia. As it turns out, Croatian tourism is in many respects verysimilar to tourism in other southern European countries, so useful les-sons can be learned by referring to the experience of these countries.The first point to note is that tourism in Croatia, as in othersouthern European countries, is dominated by international masstourism. The main object of mass tourism is the beach holiday, with itsnatural (coastal environment, climate) and man-made ingredients(restaurants, hotels, etc) marketed as “sunshine and sea” packages pro-viding an escape from the routines of domestic and work life. Thissocial image of tourism and the lack of product differentiation imply ahigh degree of substitutability among different Mediterranean resorts.They offer similar experiences – the sunshine and sea are interchange-able – and virtually the only point of competition is price.xli Efforts todevelop “elite” tourism focusing on high-income visitors or “sustain-able” tourism aimed at keeping tourism resources available for futuregenerations are not likely to succeed in replacing incomes generated bythe mass tourism industry, which brings 8-9 million tourists to Croatiaor 50 million tourists to Spain each year.xlii The Common AgriculturalPolicy of the EU, with its emphasis on farmers as keepers of the envi-ronment and on diversification of tourist destinations, has provided aboost to rural tourism in the EU, but while important in rural areas, thenet effect on the tourist industry has been minimal (Williams, 2001).The second characteristic of mass tourism is its extreme vulner-ability to developments over which the industry itself has little control.One example is tourism’s high elasticity in relation to incomes.xliiiGiven that tourist activity does not, in the main, meet a vital need,tourist behaviour is highly volatile and subject to psychological andsocial influences, personal sensitivities, fashion, and short term reac-tions. If the image of just one link in the chain is affected, then thewhole tourism industry suffers consequences. The most obvious mani-festation of this sensitivity is the impact of political uncertainty or themihaljek.qxd22.3.200512:00Page 210210security situation of tourist arrivals in a given country or region.Croatia’s experience during the 1990s is a clear case in point. However,the issue is present worldwide, especially since the terrorist attacks of11 September 2001.xlivThe tourism practiced in Croatia and other southern Europeancountries is also characterised by a potentially high level of systemicrisk on the supply side. Threshold levels of capital and skills requiredfor starting a tourism business – for instance, the letting of rooms – arerelatively low. This means that there is a high elasticity of supply.While this has provided an important opportunity for social and eco-nomic mobility for lower income households, most of which used tobe engaged in agriculture, the ease of entry into the tourism marketmay threaten the longer-term competitiveness of established touristareas as new resorts develop. Moreover, it may threaten the competi-tiveness of existing resorts through overdevelopment and devastationof the landscape. This problem has been particularly pronounced inCroatia, where weaknesses of spatial planning and local administra-tion, misplaced government incentives, and failure to control clandes-tine (“wild”) construction have forced the authorities to take drasticmeasures to prevent overbuilding and protect the public coastaldomain (see Box 3).Box 3 Clandestine construction and protection of the publiccoastal domainClandestine construction has been a longstanding issue insouthern European countries (see Mullins, 1991) and has recentlybecome a major issue in Croatia. The phenomenon has diverse ori-gins but a common outcome – devastation of the coastal environ-ment, which is a key ingredient of the main tourism product of thesecountries, and hence a serious threat to their competitiveness.The proximate causes of clandestine construction are defi-ciencies of spatial planning and local administration, and the failureof the authorities to enforce building regulations.xlv But the ultimatecause is more likely to be the lack of clearly defined property rights.This problem was highlighted by de Soto (2000) in his seminalstudy on establishing capitalism in developing countries. To illus-trate the problem, de Soto tried to open a small garment factory inPeru. He discovered that to obtain a license to operate such a smallbusiness took 289 days and cost 31 times the average yearly mini-mum wage.xlvi Not surprisingly, most people bypassed the process,operating without a license. De Soto concluded that developing andmihaljek.qxd22.3.200512:00Page 211211former socialist countries' principal problem in fostering privatesector development was how to provide easy access to legal mech-anisms such as property titles for land, houses and other assets thatindigenous entrepreneurs own de facto but not de jure. Withoutproperty titles, people have no transferable rights of ownership withwhich to establish and operate their businesses.In the case of Croatia, these problems have manifestedthemselves in long delays in obtaining clean property titles andbuilding permits. For instance, Croatian courts have accumulatedsome 400,000 unresolved cases of property claims.xlvii There havealso been many clear violations of regulations on spatial planningand construction, which captured domestic news headlines andprompted the authorities to take determined measures, including thedemolition of illegally constructed dwellings.xlviii But misplacedincentives are also partly to blame. Until recently, the governmentsubsidised loans for start-up businesses in tourism with the aim forpromoting self-employment. However, most loans were used forconstruction of tourist apartments, often without buildingpermits.xlixTo prevent further infringement of the coastline, the govern-ment passed in September 2004 Regulation on the protection of thecoastal public domain (Government of Croatia, 2004). This regula-tion is similar to Spain’s Ley de las Costas, passed in 1988 inresponse to environmental backlash against the overdevelopment ofthe coastlines, including by foreigners who acquired a large numberof secondary residences.l The regulation protects all islands, the seawithin 300 meters of the coastline, and coastal areas within 1 kilo-metre. It prohibits the construction of new houses and tourist apart-ments within 70 meters of the coastline. Except for infrastructurefacilities, new construction within 100 meters of the coastline willbe allowed only in the case of hotels and restaurants in speciallydesignated areas. The regulation also restricts other construction insettlements where the majority of the population is local as well asin tourist resorts.While this regulation may help solve some of the most acuteproblems of construction in coastal areas, Croatia will continue toface problems of the protection of the public coastal domain on apermanent basis, given that tourism results in extreme pressures onthe local economy and environment at a few points in time andspace. In particular, 95% of hotel and restaurant accommodationcapacity in Croatia is located on the Adriatic Coast and islands, andover 60% of overnight stays are recorded in July and August.mihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 212212A further notable development has been a pronounced tendencytowards self-provisioning. It has been most visible in the accommoda-tion sector and has started with the growth of second home ownershipof local residents. The growth of “weekend homes” in Croatia andother southern European countries is also a broader economic andsocial phenomenon. In the former Yugoslavia it was partly a conse-quence of scarcity of other goods and services on the market on whichto spend income on the one hand, and the basically free provision ofservices such as housing, education and health care on the other. At thesame time, the widespread distribution of second homes across socialclasses and geographical locations reflects the persistence of rural-urban ties, with first generation urban dwellers inheriting homes in thecountryside. Moreover, owning a weekend home in a coastal resort is awidely held aspiration and status symbol in all social classes, a part ofthe mythology of what constitutes social progress (Williams, 2001).With enlargement of the EU to Portugal and Spain and theremoval of restrictions on the movement of capital in the Union in the1990s, there has also been a marked increase in second home owner-ship of foreign residents. For instance, in Spain there are an estimated2 million second homes, one million of which are owned by foreigners(ibid., 2001). However, if the experience of other southern Europeancountries can be a guide, one should not expect a significant increase indirect foreign ownership of tourist facilities other than second homes.liThe reason is that foreign companies are mainly interested in facilitiesthey can differentiate through branding and location, such as hotelsaimed at business travellers or exclusive resorts. On the other hand, thetourism product being sold by Croatia (sun, sea, etc.) is largely indiffer-ent to branding and location, so the emphasis is almost entirely on thevalue for money of the total holiday package. This situation is not like-ly to change with the growth of foreign ownership of vacation homes.What are the major potential costs and benefits of increased for-eign ownership of summer vacation homes for Croatian tourism? Asnoted above, the main potential cost is that of overdevelopment. Sincethis can result in the devastation of the coastal environment, which isone of the key attractions for tourists visiting Croatia, it would result ina loss of competitiveness for the tourism industry. One should alsoemphasise that there are many tourist attractions other than real estateon the Adriatic (see Kušen, 2002) that are not adequately protected andwill need to be considered in the context of the opening-up of the realestate market to non-residents. The recent strengthening of buildingmihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 213213regulations in coastal areas and the reasoned expectation that EU resi-dents will respect these and other regulations (unlike many domesticdevelopers in the past), provide some assurance that Croatia, unlikemany coastal areas of Spain for instance, will avoid the overbuildingscenario. However, the authorities, in particular at the local level,should avoid complacency on this crucial issue, as weaknesses in theenforcement of building regulations have a long history in Croatia. Thespeed with which the real estate market is opened up to foreigners couldmake a difference here as well – a sudden increase in demand for vaca-tion homes could increase incentives for local governments and devel-opers to bypass the recently introduced building regulations and cash inon the interest of foreign buyers as quickly as possible.Other potential costs for tourism are few and largely unrelated toforeign ownership of vacation homes. Croatia’s tourism will in all like-lihood continue to face the same challenges that it grapples with today:how to encourage greater market and product diversification; investmore in effective marketing and promotion; develop the human capitaland technologies required for growth; create a more stable and pre-dictable regulatory environment; match public and private infrastructureto customer demand; and promote responsibility in natural, social andcultural environments. It is unlikely that widespread foreign ownershipof secondary residences will add to this long list of problems, the solu-tions for which are by and large well known but are difficult to imple-ment because of the lack of co-ordination among different public andprivate sector bodies and weaknesses in local administration.On the other hand, increased foreign ownership of secondaryresidences could have a number of potentially significant benefits fortourism and local communities. With the revival of interest by foreignbuyers, houses and land that until recently had little or no economicvalue have practically overnight become a potentially important sourceof wealth for indigenous owners and local communities. In addition,much of the existing housing stock could be renewed by foreignersinterested in owning old stone houses build in the authentic architectur-al style of this part of the Mediterranean. This would increase attrac-tiveness of the Adriatic Coast and islands for other tourists as well.Foreign investment in real estate could also revive local commu-nities on the Adriatic. Demographic trends in many coastal communi-ties and on most islands have been unfavourable ever since the late 19thcentury, and these trends seem to have accelerated over the past decade(see Wertheimer-Baletiæ, 2003). This has resulted in lack of investmentmihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 214214in housing, infrastructure and public services, with possibly tens ofthousands of old houses falling into disrepair and many villages beingabandoned. A trend observed in other southern European countries isthat many second homes eventually become the principal homes ofexpatriate settlers, thereby generating year-round income streams andpermanent jobs in local communities. These jobs might in turn lead tothe establishment of many new households on the Adriatic, whichcould over time perhaps reverse negative demographic trends. Theclearest examples of this course of development worldwide are the USstates of Arizona and Florida, where many previously dormant commu-nities have been transformed into vibrant centres of development aftererstwhile tourists from northern states established their permanent res-idence in the south.Local authorities and indigenous entrepreneurs would thus bewell advised to use the current period of strong interest in Croatia as atourist destination to plan for the future. Sooner or later, the demandand the supply are likely to shift – tourism, like any industry, cannotavoid changes in consumer preferences and the product life cycle. Or toput it differently, tourism is neither “a passport to development” nor a“unique devil” (de Kadt, 1979); its role in economic developmentdepends on the form of tourism and on the structure of the national andregional economies within which it is inserted.MACROECONOMIC EFFECTSWhat are the likely effects of increased foreign investment insecondary residences on the national economy?One important macroeconomic effect – the wealth effect – hasalready been in evidence for some time. As noted above, the value ofreal estate and land in areas that are attracting potential buyers hasincreased even ahead of any large-scale property sales to foreigners.This clearly demonstrates the powerful impact that economic expecta-tions exert on current asset valuations. It also implies that any tighten-ing of restrictions on property sales to foreigners would result in wealthlosses. In an extreme case, prohibiting the sales of real estate to foreign-ers would wipe out billions of euros of potential wealth of Croatian cit-izens and a proportionate amount of tax revenues.Another key macroeconomic effect relates to the potentiallylarge capital inflows associated with non-residents’ payments for prop-mihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 215215erties purchased in Croatia. Considering only the estimate of house pur-chases that are currently being arranged – the sales of 10,000 housesmentioned above – and assuming a very conservative average price of50,000 euros per house, capital inflows already in the pipeline wouldamount to about 500 million euros, or nearly 2% of GDP. To put thisnumber in perspective, it is equivalent to the average annual net issuanceof international bonds by the Croatian government during 1995-2003, orto 50% of the average annual inflows of foreign direct investment. Anoverly rapid liberalisation of the real estate market could thus unleashpotentially significant appreciation pressures on the kuna, which couldhave important effects on the external competitiveness of the economyas a whole and export industries, including tourism.The wealth effect and the associated capital inflows will be ini-tially distributed among property and land owners on the one side, andthe construction and real estate development industries on the other.Depending on how the income thus generated is spent and invested, onecan envisage a number of different macroeconomic scenarios. One pos-sibility is that property and land owners will use the bulk of the pro-ceeds of real estate sales to finance personal consumption, while theconstruction and real estate development industries will use additionalrevenue largely to raise wages and dividend payments. This wouldresult in rapid growth of personal consumption and imports, inflation-ary pressures, deterioration of the external current account, and eventu-ally loss of competitiveness. Another possibility is that the capital gen-erated by the real estate sales is reinvested in local housing, tourismenterprises, or other sectors of the economy. This would lead to demandpressures and additional imports as well, but in contrast to the formerscenario the productive capacity of the economy would increase, help-ing to maintain longer-term competitiveness. Finally, the proceeds ofproperty sales could be reinvested abroad, so the net effect of the inflowcould be more or less offset by capital outflows.There would in addition be a series of second round effectsstemming from the consumption and investment patterns of foreignowners of secondary residences. If the residences are rented out to for-eign holiday makers who would otherwise purchase accommodationfrom domestic owners of hotels or apartments, the income stream fromtourism might be reduced. However, if secondary residences becomethe principal homes of foreign buyers, as has been suggested above,they may generate permanent income streams for local communitiesand the domestic economy.mihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 216216The effects of property sales to foreigners on fiscal revenues arelikely to be positive. The sales as well as any increase in personal con-sumption resulting from the sales will generate additional VAT rev-enue. Likewise, additional personal and corporate incomes generatedby investing the proceeds of sales will at least partly be subject toincome taxes. The overall fiscal effect will then depend on how addi-tional revenue is spent by the local communities and the central govern-ment. Here one could consider the same scenarios as with personal con-sumption and investment: if additional fiscal revenues are spent on cur-rent public consumption, domestic demand pressures (and possiblyimports) will increase; if they are invested in education, debt repay-ment, infrastructure, improvements in the functioning of public servic-es and institutions etc, demand pressures may increase, but the compet-itive position of the economy will improve in the long run.All of these effects have yet to be researched, so at present it isnot possible to assess with any degree of certainty the likely macroeco-nomic effects of foreign investment in Croatia’s property.Nevertheless, given the size of potential wealth effects and capitalinflows, there are solid economic arguments in favour of a gradualrather than a swift liberalisation of the property market.CONCLUSION AND POLICYRECOMMENDATIONSThe main conclusion from the preceding analysis is that Croatiastands to benefit in the long term from foreign investment in the prop-erty sector, but in the medium term a measured approach to the open-ing-up of the market can be justified on a number of grounds. Theseinclude spillovers of price increases from the market for secondary res-idences onto the local housing market (of which there is already someevidence); costs of adjustment in the housing market and constructionindustry to a sudden large increase in demand for secondary residences;loss of competitiveness in the tourism industry in the case of violationsof building regulations and the resulting overdevelopment of coastalareas (the incentives for which would increase if the property market isopened up suddenly); and macroeconomic pressures arising from largeand sudden capital inflows.Another general conclusion is that much additional researchneeds to be done on the economics of the real estate market, tourismmihaljek.qxd22.3.200512:00Page 217217and on the macroeconomic effects of developments in the propertymarket. In particular, major efforts at improving statistical informationon the real estate market and tourism are necessary. For instance, with-out comprehensive information on transactions in the market for exist-ing homes or in the housing construction industry, it is not possible toassess the overall state of the housing market, nor can one develop use-ful scenarios for the diverse macroeconomic effects of foreign invest-ment in the property sector. In addition, the analysis has identified anumber of weaknesses in the current legislative framework, from regu-lations on property sales to foreigners, to inadequate legislation protect-ing against property speculation, to the well-known problems withproperty titles, cadastres, and enforcement of building and spatial plan-ning regulations.Against this background, what approach could Croatia follow innegotiations on the free movement of capital with the EU? The difficul-ty of negotiations on this point can be better understood when put in theproper perspective of the way that negotiations are conducted. By join-ing the EU, a country accepts to adopt and apply the rules of the club.Exceptionally, the EU agrees that certain rules can be adopted over alonger time horizon after membership, provided that exceptions arelimited in scope and in time. Exceptions are therefore temporary innature and granted to allow a country sufficient time to adapt. In thecase of Croatia, a transitional period for investment in real estate last-ing four years from the entry into force of the SAA has already beenagreed. However, Croatian authorities could decide to extend this peri-od once negotiations on EU membership begin. But since otherrequests for transitional periods will undoubtedly be made in the nego-tiation process, the authorities will need to set up priorities among dif-ferent areas, deciding whether, for instance, it is more important torequest a longer transitional period for the real estate sector or foradjustment in agriculture.Yet, if transitional periods are exceptional, it is evident that per-manent arrangements – also known as derogations – are practicallyruled out. The reason is that by their very nature derogations go againstthe principle that the law is equal for all (Busuttil, 2002). Derogationsalso go against the spirit of acting in common, because they allow acountry to operate outside the scope of the law binding all the rest. Ifderogations applied in all cases, there would be no common action andthere would be little scope for having the EU at all. No country canexpect to benefit from the rights of membership if, at the same time, itdoes not want to shoulder the obligations.mihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 218218Although Section 2 highlighted some examples in EU lawwhere derogations have been granted to individual countries to allowthem to operate differently from the rest – for instance, the cases ofMalta and Denmark in respect of restrictions on foreign ownership ofsecondary residences, and Poland in respect of agricultural land pur-chases by non-residents – it is not likely that Croatia will be able towring any meaningful concessions out of the EU. The reason is that itwould be very hard to prove that Croatia has a paramount reason for notallowing EU residents to buy property beyond one secondary residence.Inadequate legislation against property speculation is a weak excuse –adopting such legislation is in the interests of the country already, asdomestic residents could engage in such activities. Likewise, it is not inthe long-run economic interest of Croatian citizens and the authoritiesto further restrict foreign ownership of real estate, as this would wipeout considerable amounts of potential wealth and fiscal revenue. A wellarticulated public discussion could nevertheless help in formulatingarguments to support Croatia’s case on this and other important issues,and in deciding on the priority areas that need adjustment and hencelonger transitional periods.Turning to the real estate market, Section 3 identified two chan-nels through which the opening of Croatia’s real estate market to EUresidents could affect housing prices and affordability: expectations offuture price increases, and housing supply rigidities in the event a rapidliberalisation leads to a sudden increase in demand for property by for-eign investors. Recommendations in this area are therefore morestraightforward. First, the authorities need to stabilise the expectationsthat a housing boom on the Adriatic is imminent. Particularly helpful inthis respect would be a more transparent and efficient application ofexisting regulations on sales of real estate to foreigners, and the contin-ued determined implementation of the latest regulation on housing con-struction and protection of the coastal public domain.Second, much can be done to improve the legislative frameworkand administrative procedures for property transactions. Legal uncer-tainty is probably a major constraint on the potential supply of perma-nent housing in the secondary market at present. Clean property titlesand orderly and more efficient cadastres would bring to the marketmany houses, apartments and pieces of land that are currently withheldfrom the market.Third, one aspect of housing finance that is visible in mostindustrial countries and many new EU members but is absent in Croatiamihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 219219is involvement of the state in the mortgage market. Hungary andPoland, for instance, introduced legislation on mortgage bonds andmortgage banks following the German approach, while in Bulgaria, theCzech Republic, Latvia, and Slovakia commercial banks can obtain amortgage banking license and issue mortgage bonds, which providebanks with an alternative tool to raise funds earmarked for housingloans. In addition, in most European countries the state has been pro-viding a limited amount of housing loans directly, by establishing pub-lic funds to promote housing construction and finance. While Croatiahas developed two such schemes, it is not clear that one of them (thePOS scheme) is well targeted.In Section 4 it was argued that the character of Croatia’s tourismis not likely to change significantly with the growth of foreign owner-ship of vacation homes. While some additional pressures on the envi-ronment and local economies can be expected, they would not differqualitatively from the pressures that tourist resorts are already experi-encing with the robust growth of tourism in recent years. As for thebroader implications of EU accession on Croatia’s tourism industry,these can be largely separated from the issue of increased foreign own-ership of vacation homes. Thus far there has been little EU interventionin the field of tourism. Freedom of movement provisions, competitionlaw and other EU regulations have barely touched the tourism industry(Williams, 2001). Most tourism regions in Croatia will have to facechoices about diversifying their source and product markets, imposingstricter development controls and improving the quality of their tourismproduct irrespective of accession to the EU. Given the ease of entry intotourism, which is domina ted by fragmented indigenous capital, theywill also face greater competition from other southern European desti-nations and the challenge of constantly adapting to new forms ofdemand. Some resorts may decline as a result unless they are reinvigo-rated by new investment and innovation. In this area, foreign invest-ment in real estate could play a very useful role.Regarding the macroeconomic effects of foreign investment in theproperty sector, no one knows exactly how many foreigners may eventu-ally end up buying property in Croatia. Perhaps the share of secondaryresidences owned by foreigners will never be as high as for instance the50% share in Spain. In the case of Croatia, this would imply purchases ofsome 100,000 vacation homes by foreigners, resulting in potentialinflows of 5 billion euros, or 20% of GDP. But as argued in Section 5,even if foreigners purchase only a few thousand vacation homes, themihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 220220Annexeffects on the local and national economies would be sufficiently high towarrant caution on the part of macroeconomic policy makers.Measuring the economic impact of tourism:Tourism Satellite AccountTourism plays a significant role in many economies in terms ofthe production of goods and services and the creation of employmentopportunities. However, tourism remains difficult to define and meas-ure, and as a result the industry suffers from a credibility problem. Inthe case of conventional industries such as agriculture or manufactur-ing, the contribution of industry to GDP is measured from the supplyside, i.e., from the value of goods and services they produce. In the caseof tourism, this conventional approach covers mainly the output provid-ed by the hotel and restaurant industry, which is equivalent to onlyabout 3% of GDP in Croatia. Yet the contribution of tourism to GDPgoes far beyond this narrow definition, to other industries supplyingtourism output such as agriculture, fishing, the food industry, construc-tion, transportation, cultural establishments, etc.In the past, economists relied on estimates of income multipliersto approximate indirect effects of tourism on domestic industries otherthan hotels and restaurants.lii This methodology, however, is unreliableas it is based on many ad hoc assumptions. In contrast, TSA recast thenational accounts so as to identify the diverse products and services thatare delivered to domestic and foreign visitors. On the demand side,TSA include two basic aggregates:• Travel and tourism consumption, which includes four components: (i)the value of products and services consumed by domestic and interna-tional visitors for personal travel and tourism; (ii) business travel bygovernment and industry; (iii) expenditure by individual governmentagencies and departments that specialise in visitor services (culturaland recreational establishments, immigration and customs, etc) and(iv) spending by international visitors on goods and services (so-called visitor exports).• Travel and tourism demand, which estimates a broader, economy-wide impact of tourism and includes three components: (i) publicmihaljek.qxd22.3.200512:00Page 221221spending on tourism promotion, aviation administration, security andsimilar services made on behalf of the community at large but close-ly associated with tourism (so-called collective government expendi-ture); (ii) capital investments to provide facilities, equipment andinfrastructure to visitors and (iii) goods and capital sent abroad forultimate sale to visitors or use by providers of travel and tourism serv-ices (so-called non-visitor exports).On the supply side, TSA also produce two different aggregates:the travel and tourism industry and the travel and tourism economy.The former captures only the direct impact of travel and tourism forcomparison with conventional industries such as manufacturing. Thelatter captures the broader, indirect, or economy-wide impact of traveland tourism. The TSA show separately the portion of travel and tourismsupply that is imported (including expenditure on outbound travel bydomestic residents), and also calculate direct and indirect componentsof value added produced by travel and tourism industry. Finally, theTSA show employment for travel and tourism industry and travel andtourism economy.iiiiiiivvviThe excluded sectors are agricultural and forestry land, forests and areas protect-ed under the Environmental Protection Act (NN 30/94), including national parks,nature parks and other protected areas of nature.See “Information about acquiring real property ownership in Croatia for foreigncitizens” on the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [www.mvp.hr].The lengthy approval procedure is perhaps more a reflection of red tape in variousministries and local governments involved (on this, see World Bank, 2004) than ofthe strictness of regulations per se.Properties acquired by residents of Slovenia before the split of the formerYugoslavia are not affected by this regulation. Many vacation homes owned by res-idents of other former Yugoslav republics before 1991 have been sold in the mean-time. However, the status of many resort properties and much commercial realestate owned by companies from the former republics is still unresolved (seeNacional, 22 June 2004 [www.nacional.hr]).Similar data were earlier quoted in Slobodna Dalmacija, 26 August 2004[www.slobodnadalmacija.hr] and Nacional, 31 August 2004. Data reported inTable 1 were released after one member of the Croatian parliament officiallyinquired about this issue in the parliament.Different news media have reported vastly different approval rates. According toFinancial Times, approval to buy property is given to 95–98% of all applicants (FTHouse and Home, 15–16 May 2004; www.ft.com). However, according to SlobodnaDalmacija (26 August 2004) and Novi list (13 September 2004; www.novilist.hr),approval to buy property has been given to only 36% of applicants, which is closerto the subsequently reported official figures shown in Table 1.mihaljek.qxd22.3.200512:00Page 222222vii See Jutarnji list, 20 March 2004 (weekly supplement Real estate, page 47).viii Property speculation is usually defined as the holding of unimproved or under-improved property for the purpose of reselling profitably without any substantialcapital investment. Local authorities in Croatia currently impose a tax on unusedland for construction and commercial property; however, the tax rate is fairly low(up to a maximum of 15 kuna, or 2 euros, per square meter), and unused residen-tial property is not taxed (see Kesner-Škreb and Kuliš, 2001).ix The Croatian tax authorities define capital gains on property sales as the differ-ence between the sale price and the purchase price of property adjusted for theproducer price index of industrial products (see Law on the income tax, NN127/2000, 150/2002 and 163/2003, paragraph 23). In other words, any increase inthe value of property due to producer price inflation is not taxed.x See for instance<ref> Government of Bulgaria (2000) and<ref> Government of Romania(2001).xi Cert</ref>ain types of activities, in </ref>particular self-employed farmers who wish to estab-lish themselves and reside in new member states, would be allowed to buy landimmediately.xii Only Ireland and the United Kingdom have allowed free immigration of workersfrom new member states as of 1 May 2004.xiii See Vjesnik, 30 August 2004 [www.vjesnik.hr] and Novi list, 13 September 2004.xiv See Treaty on European Union, Protocol (No 1) on the acquisition of property inDenmark, Official Journal C 191, 29/07/1992 p. 68.xv For an insightful game-theoretical analysis of negotiating strategies used by theEU and CEEC (including Bulgaria and Romania) see Papadimitriou (2002).xvi Recent references include Bezovan (2004); Dru iæ (2001); Fröhlich (2003); andTica (2002; 2004).xvii About 10% of dwellings are rented and 7% are shared with other families (2001Census).xviii In addition to owner-occupied housing, other categories in this classificationinclude privately rented, co-operative and social housing.xix In Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Slovenia and Romania the ratio of owner-occupiedhousing exceeds 90%.xx This comparison assumes that in equilibrium the number of households is equal tothe number of permanently occupied dwellings.xxi Temporarily unoccupied dwellings include vacant dwellings for rent or sale; thosethat are not used or rented by their owners; and those that are being refurbished.Note that vacation homes and apartments are not included in this category.xxii Comparable data for the more recent years are not available because of change instatistical methodology.xxiii Data for the coastal area and islands are approximated from census data for 7counties abutting the sea.xxiv See for instance International Herald Tribune, 7 June 2004 [www.iht.com]; FinancialTimes, 15–16 May 2004 and Daily Mirror, 8 July 2004 [www.mirror.co.uk].xxv See Vjesnik, 14–15 August 2004, pages 20–21.xxvi See for instance Veèernji list, 20 September 2004 [www.vecernji-list.hr].According to Vjesnik (14–15 August 2004) and Slobodna Dalmacija (22 September2004), prices of land increased in many areas of the Adriatic by over 100% in twoyears and, depending on the location, varied from 20–500 euros per m2.xxvii Newly completed properties are subject to the VAT at a rate of 22%, while salesof existing properties are subject to a 5% tax on real estate sales; see Kesner-Škreband Kuliš (2001).mihaljek.qxd22.3.200512:00Page 223223xxviii See Jutarnji list, 20 March 2004 (weekly supplement Real estate, pages 44–45).xxix See Slobodna Dalmacija, 22 September 2004.xxx In the OECD countries, average house prices have not declined in nominal termsin any year since 1945.xxxi Housing loans account for 67% of total loans to households in the euro area and64% in Hungary.xxxii For instance, in the municipal court in Zagreb there were 1,200 cases of foreclo-sure involving auctions of seized properties in the past four years (Dnevnik, 24May 2004; www.dnevnik.com). In the municipal court in Split, 380 such caseswere being processed in early 2004 (Slobodna Dalmacija, 7 May 2004).xxxiii The figure on net earnings was obtained as the product of average net earningsin 2003 (3,918 kuna per month) and average number of persons in paid employ-ment in legal entities during 2003 (1.39 million).xxxiv See Dnevnik, 23 September 2004.xxxv See the web page of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, Physical Planningand Construction [www.mzopu.hr].xxxvi Down payment amounts to 131 euros per m2, and monthly debt servicing cost toabout 160 euros for a 40,000 apartment [www.mzopu.hr]. As noted above, aver-age monthly personal income in 2003 was about 520 euros.xxxvii A personal anecdote illustrates this point: when the author started his first job in1982 and inquired about the burden of housing loans, one of his colleaguesreplied: “It’s really easy: the first few months your entire salary goes to repay theloan, and after a year or so the monthly payment costs the same as a bottle ofwine”.xxxviii One should recognize at the same time that the current older generation is worse-off in terms of health care costs, which were fully subsidized during socialism butare now increasingly borne fully by the patients.xxxix Another useful study is the tourism development strategy elaborated by the IZTZG(2003).xl These figures are adjusted for the latest data on GDP and employment in 2003.The World Travel and Tourism Council (2004) used preliminary estimates ofthese series. On this basis, the contribution of travel and tourism in 2003 was esti-mated at 22.4% of GDP and 27.4% of total employment.xli Estimates of price elasticities of demand by tourists from western Europe and theUnited States for holidays in Italy, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Turkey rangefrom –0.3 to –3.2. That is, a 1% increase in the price of a package holiday incountry A will reduce the demand for vacation in that country by westernEuropean and US visitors by up to 3.2% (see Syrioupoulos and Sinclair, 1993).xlii It is interesting to note that social science researchers (including in Croatia) haveshown considerable interest in sustainable tourism (see for instance Cariæ, 2003;Creaco and Querini, 2003; Petriæ, 2003; and Petrin, 2004), but very little inter-est in analytical work on the economics of tourism.xliii Average income elasticity of demand for holidays in Italy is estimated at around2.0; in Greece and Turkey 1.8; Portugal 2.5; and in Spain 1.5. That is, a 1%decrease in income of western European visitors is associated with a 2.5%decrease in demand for holiday travel to Portugal (see Syrioupoulos, 1995).xliv See for instance<ref> Scottish Parliament Information Centre (2002).xlv For problems o</ref>f spatial planning in Croatia, see Kranjèeviæ (2005).xlvi For other vivid examples, see World Bank (2004).xlvii See Vjesnik, 9 July 2004.mihaljek.qxd22.3.200512:00Page 224224xlviii In the spring of 2004, a total of 185 properties were demolished (Vjesnik, 11September 2004). The problem is even more pronounced in Albania: in January2003 the government said only 500 of the 3,000 buildings on the 450 km coastwere legal. It has since destroyed 1,000 and recently announced it would raze fur-ther 300 illegally built hotels and restaurants (International Herald Tribune, 23September 2004).xlix See Dnevnik, 6 June 2004.l See Government of Spain (1988) and<ref> Ministerio de medio ambiente (2004).li For instance, Spain’s</ref> 65 hotel groups own some 30% of hotel capacity (the rest aremostly small family-owned hotels). But only one-quarter of hotel groups have anyforeign capital, and in only half of these groups does foreign participation exceed50% of capital (Estudios Turisticos, 1988).lii See for instance Diamond (1969) and Sinclair (1998).mihaljek.qxd 22.3.2005 12:00 Page 225225LITERATURE<ref>***, 2002.
