ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTprosocial songs 1Effects of songs with prosocial lyrics on prosocial thoughts, affect, and behaviorTobias GreitemeyerUniversity of SussexBrighton, EnglandAuthor Note:I am grateful to Colin Wayne Leach for suggestions on a previous draft of this manuscript.ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTprosocial songs 2AbstractPrevious research has shown that exposure to violent media increased aggression-relatedaffect and thoughts, physiological arousal, and aggressive behavior as well as decreasedprosocial tendencies. The present research examined the hypothesis that exposure to prosocialmedia promotes prosocial outcomes. Three studies revealed that listening to songs withprosocial (relative to neutral) lyrics increased the accessibility of prosocial thoughts, led tomore interpersonal empathy, and fostered helping behavior. These results provide firstevidence for the predictive validity of the General Learning Model (Buckley & Anderson,2006) for the effects of media with prosocial content on prosocial thought, feeling, andbehavior.Key Words: prosocial behavior; music; media effectsACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTprosocial songs 3Effects of songs with prosocial lyrics on prosocial thoughts, affect, and behaviorExposure to media is omnipresent in people’s daily life. For instance, listening tomusic—the topic of the present paper—is of substantial importance to many people: InEurope, according to Nielsen Interactive Entertainment, people spend an average of 10.55hours per week listening to music. Similarly, the average American youth listens to music 1.5to 2.5 hours per day, not including the time they are exposed to music via music videos(Roberts, Foehr, & Rideout, 2003). Other research (Rentfrow & Gosling, 2003) also revealedthat people consider music an important aspect of their lives, which is at least as important asmost other leisure activities. This has led to the suggestion that media exposure could be animportant determinant of pro- (Mares & Woodard, 2005) and antisocial behavior (Robinson,Wilde, Navracruz, Haydel, & Varady, 2001). However, whereas negative effects of exposureto media with violent content on aggressive behavior are well-documented, research on theeffects of media with prosocial content on prosocial tendencies has been relatively sparse.Thus, in the present research, the hypothesis is examined that exposure to songs withprosocial lyrics increases prosocial thoughts, affect, and behavior. So far, this has not beentested.Research on Media ViolenceIt is well-documented that exposure to violent media promotes aggressive thoughts,feelings, and behavior, and decreases prosocial behavior (for an overview, see Bushman &Huesmann, 2006). For instance, correlational evidence indicated that consumers of rap andheavy metal music reported more hostile attitudes (Rubin, West, & Mitchell, 2001).Experimental studies corroborated this finding: Listening to aggressive (relative to neutral)song lyrics increased aggressive thoughts, hostile feelings (Anderson, Carnagey, & Eubanks,2003), and aggressive action (Fischer & Greitemeyer, 2006; Hansen & Hansen, 1990).ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTprosocial songs 4Past research has also addressed the impact of violent video games on aggressivecognitions, affect, and behavior. For instance, playing a violent (relative to a neutral) videogame increases the hostile expectation bias (Bushman & Anderson, 2002), state hostility andanxiety levels (Anderson & Ford, 1986), desensitization to violence (Bartholow, Bushman, &Sestir, 2006; Carnagey, Anderson, & Bushman, 2007), punitive behavior (Bartholow &Anderson, 2002), physical violence (Gentile et al., 2004), and criminal actions (Anderson &Dill, 2000), and decreases donations to a charity (Chambers & Ascione, 1987) andcooperative behavior (Sheese & Graziano, 2005). Recent longitudinal evidence (Anderson,Gentile, & Buckley, 2007) further revealed that exposure to violent video games had not onlyshort-term effects, but also long-term consequences in that aggressive tendencies weresignificantly predicted by video game violence exposure five months earlier (even aftercontrolling for Time 1 aggressive tendencies). In sum, the detrimental effects of exposure toviolent media on aggression-related variables are well-documented.Research on the Effects of Television on Prosocial BehaviorThere is some indirect evidence for the possibility that exposure to prosocial songsincreases prosocial tendencies: it has been shown that exposure to television with prosocialcontent has some positive effects. In an early study (Sprafkin, Liebert, & Poulos, 1975),children were exposed to a film about the dog Lassie. In the prosocial condition, Lassie savedher puppies by barking for help. In the control condition, no prosocial behavior was exhibited.Results revealed that children in the prosocial condition were more likely to help a puppy inneed of help than children in the control condition. Two meta-analyses (Hearold, 1986; Mares& Woodard, 2005) corroborated this finding: Exposure to prosocial television content hasbeneficial effects on prosocial behavior.Theoretical PerspectivesThe effects of violent media on aggression-related variables have been mainlyACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTprosocial songs 5explained by the General Aggression Model (GAM) proposed by Anderson and colleagues(e.g., Anderson & Bushman, 2002). This model integrates various theories, including sociallearning theory and related social-cognitive research, affective aggression model, socialinformation-processing model, script theory, and excitation transfer model. According to theGAM, exposure to violent media activates an individual’s internal states (cognition, affect,and arousal), which in turn change the interpretation of a potential conflict situation thatresults in aggressive behavior. The initial impulse to violent media is based on an automaticappraisal of the situation. However, when sufficient resources (e.g., cognitive capacity,motivation) are available a more thoughtful behavioral reaction could also occur. In addition,the model does not only account for short term effects of violent media exposure onaggression, but also for long term changes as a results of repeated encounters with violentmedia (i.e., each media exposure episode constitutes a learning trial).Recently, this model has been expanded into a General Learning Model (GLM) toexplain the effects of both violent and non-violent media on social behavior (Buckley &Anderson, 2006). As with the GAM, the GLM assumes that media exposure affects internalvariables, consisting of cognition, affect, and arousal, which lead to behavior. However, ratherthan focusing only on the negative consequences of exposure to antisocial media, the GLMsuggests that positive media can have positive effects. Thus, depending on the content of themedia, either negative or positive effects of media exposure on social behavior are to beexpected. That is, whereas antisocial media instigate aggression and aggression-relatedvariables, prosocial media should foster prosocial outcomes. However, whereas many studieshave documented the influence of violent media exposure on aggression and aggression-related variables, the effects of media with prosocial content on prosocial outcomes has notbeen examined. Thus, the predictive validity of the GLM for prosocial effects of media hasnot been tested.ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTprosocial songs6The Present ResearchFor this reason, the present research examined positive effects of exposure to prosocialsongs. The first two studies measured prosocial thoughts and affects, which are possibleprecursors, as outlined by GLM, of prosocial action. Specifically, the hypothesis was testedthat listening to prosocial (relative to neutral) songs increased the accessibility of prosocialthoughts (Experiment 1) and led to more interpersonal empathy (Experiment 2). Finally,Experiment 3 addressed behavioral outcomes from listening to songs with prosocial content inthat actual helping behavior was assessed.Pilot testingIn all experiments, participants listened to two songs. To increase the ecologicalvalidity of the experimental manipulation, one song with English lyrics and one song withGerman lyrics were used. Artists and genres were matched across experimental conditions.Participants in the prosocial condition were exposed to: “Love generation” (Bob Sinclair) and“Kommt zusammen” (2raumwohnung). Participants in the neutral condition were exposed to:“Rock this party” (Bob Sinclair) and “Lachen und Weinen” (2raumwohnung).These songs were pretested in two pilot studies. Participants were from the sameparticipant pool as in the three main experiments. In both pilot studies, participants listened toeither the two prosocial or the two neutral songs. In the first pretest, there were 40 participants(28 women, 12 men). After listening of each song, they rated to what extent the song lyricswere prosocial, how much they liked the song, and to what extent the song was arousing. Allitems were assessed on scales from 0 = not at all to 7 = definitely. As intended, the content ofthe prosocial songs was perceived as being more prosocial (English song: M = 4.85, SD =1.46; German song: M = 4.20, SD = 1.88) than the content of the neutral songs (English song:M = 2.55, SD = 1.73; German song: M = 0.65, SD = 0.81), t(38) = 4.54, p < .001, d = 1.44;t(38) = 7.75, p < .001, d = 2.45, respectively. In contrast, there were no significant differencesACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTprosocial songs7with regard to liking (prosocial English song: M = 3.00, SD = 2.18; neutral English song: M =3.10, SD = 1.80; t(38) = 0.16, p = .88, d = 0.05; prosocial German song: M = 2.40, SD = 2.35;neutral German song: M = 3.15, SD = 1.84; t(38) = 1.12, p = .27, d = 0.36) and arousal(prosocial English song: M = 3.20, SD = 1.74; neutral English song: M = 3.00, SD = 1.86;t(38) = 0.35, p = .73, d = 0.11; prosocial German song: M = 1.60, SD = 2.21; neutral Germansong: M = 2.75, SD = 1.89; t(38) = 1.77, p = .09, d = 0.56).In the second pretest (39 women, 11 men), perceived arousal and mood were assessed.The Perceived Arousal Scale (Anderson, Deuser, & DeNeve, 1995) contains 31 adjectivesdescribing feelings of arousal (e.g., aroused) or lack of arousal (e.g., drowsy). Lack of arousalitems were reverse scored. Positive and negative emotions were assessed by employing thePANAS (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). Arousal properties of the prosocial (M = 2.88,SD = 0.74) and neutral songs (M = 3.03, SD = 0.79) were relatively similar, t(48) = 0.71, p =.48, d = 0.20. In addition, there were no significant effects for mood, neither on the positiveaffect scale (prosocial: M = 2.36, SD = 0.75, neutral: M = 2.12, SD = 0.77), t(48) = 1.08, p =.29, d = 0.32, nor on the negative affect scale (prosocial: M = 1.40, SD = 0.38, neutral: M =1.48, SD = 0.50), t(48) = 0.60, p = .55, d = 0.18. Thus, because the arousal and moodproperties of the songs used were relatively similar, effects of the songs on prosocial thoughts,feelings, and behavior cannot be attributed to mood and arousal differences. (With was aimedfor: inasmuch as both prosocial and neutral songs can affect arousal, the arousal route isscientifically less interesting than the cognitive and the affective route, respectively.)Experiment 1The aim of Experiment 1 was to test the effect of prosocial songs on prosocialthoughts. It was expected that listening to prosocial (relative to neutral) songs would increasethe accessibility of prosocial thoughts.MethodACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTprosocial songs 8Participants and design. Participants were 34 students (19 women, 11 men, fourparticipants did not indicate their sex) of the Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU) inMunich, Germany, who were randomly assigned to one of the two song conditions (prosocialvs. neutral). There were 18 participants in the prosocial condition and 16 participants in theneutral condition.Procedure and materials. Participants were welcomed by one female experimenterand learned that the purpose of the present study was to examine the impact of songs onthinking. To assess prosocial thought accessibility, a word completion task was used. Such atask has been successfully employed in previous research into the effects of violent media onaggressive thoughts (e.g., Anderson et al., 2003; Barlett, Harris, & Bruey, 2008).1 Participantsreceived a list of 18 word fragments. Their task was to fill in the missing letters to form aword. For instance, “hi___” can become the prosocial word “hilfe” (“help”) or the neutralword “hier” (“here”). Accessibility of prosocial thoughts was the proportion of wordcompletions that were prosocial (that is, number of prosocial thoughts divided by the totalnumber of word fragments completed).Then, participants responded to two control questions to verify that the prosocial andthe neutral songs differed in content. For each song, participants rated to what extent the songlyrics were about helping and cooperation, respectively. These ratings were highly correlatedand thus combined to a prosocial index (English song: = .75; German song: = .82).Finally, participants answered demographic questions, were thanked, and fully debriefed.Participants were tested in small groups of three to four people.Results and DiscussionAs intended, the content of the prosocial and the neutral songs clearly differed. Thecontent of the prosocial songs was perceived as being more prosocial (English song: M =4.94, SD = 1.47; German song: M = 4.50, SD = 1.29) than the content of the neutral songsACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTprosocial songs9(English song: M = 2.56, SD = 1.54; German song: M = 2.00, SD = 1.57), t(32) = 4.61, p <.001, d = 1.58; t(32) = 5.09, p < .001, d = 1.74, respectively.The effect of type of song on prosocial thought accessibility was reliable: Participantswho had listened to the prosocial songs (M = 0.21, SD = 0.11) had higher prosocial wordcompletion scores than those who had listened to the neutral songs (M = 0.14, SD = 0.08),t(32) = 2.05, p < .05, d = 0.73. Participant sex had no significant effect on prosocial thoughtaccessibility, t(28) = 0.49, p = .63, d = 0.19.As expected, listening to songs with prosocial content increased the accessibility ofprosocial thoughts. Thus, these results provide first evidence for the hypothesis that exposureto prosocial media affects an individual’s internal state that, as outlined by GLM, mayinstigate behavioral reactions. Before data on the effects of exposure to prosocial songs onhelping behavior are presented, I first address a second main route on how media exposuremay affect behavior: empathy as an indicator of affect. This was done in Experiment 2.Experiment 2Experiment 2 tested an important contributor to prosocial behavior, namely, empathy(Batson, 1991). It was expected that listening to prosocial (relative to neutral) songs wouldincrease empathy toward others in need.MethodParticipants and design. Participants were 38 students (27 women, 11 men) of theLMU. There were 18 participants in the prosocial condition and 20 participants in the neutralcondition.Procedure and materials. As in Experiment 1, participants were welcomed by afemale experimenter. They learned that they would take part in a marketing survey. Afterlistening to each song, participants indicated their liking of the song. Participants then learnedthat another study was being conducted in which participants were asked to read essays fromACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTprosocial songs 10other participants. Because the participant who was supposed to read the essays did not showup for the study, the participant was asked to read and respond to two essays (adapted fromDeWall & Baumeister, 2006). The first essay stated that the author broke up with hisgirlfriend, although they had been together for quite a long time and had been very close.Recently, however, things had changed and she told him that she did not want to be tied downto just one person. The author stated that he was suffering severely. In the second essay, theauthor noted that he broke his leg during an intramural game. He had played for this team forthree years, but now this season is over for him. In addition to this mental pain, his injuryphysically hurts. Life on campus is very difficult because of his crutches. He is really downand this is all he thinks about. Directly after each essay, participants indicated howsympathetic, compassionate, and soft-hearted they felt toward the author of the essay (seeManer & Gailliot, 2007). These items were highly correlated and thus pooled in an empathyscale (romantic relationship: = .75; broken leg: = .72).As in Experiment 1, participants rated to what extent the song lyrics were abouthelping and cooperation, respectively. These ratings were moderately correlated and thuscombined to a prosocial index (English song: = .55; German song: = .68). Finally,participants answered demographic questions, were thanked, and fully debriefed. Allparticipants were tested individually.Results and DiscussionAs in Experiment 1, the content of the prosocial songs was perceived as being moreprosocial (English song: M = 4.22, SD = 1.32; German song: M = 4.28, SD = 1.77) than thecontent of the neutral songs (English song: M = 2.70, SD = 1.51; German song: M = 1.70, SD= 1.37), t(36) = 3.30, p < .01, d = 1.07; t(36) = 5.05, p < .001, d = 1.63, respectively.As expected, listening to prosocial songs increased empathy toward others in need. A2 (type of song) X 2 (essay: romantic vs. broken leg) ANOVA with repeated measures on theACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTprosocial songs 11latter factor revealed a significant main effect for type of song, F(1, 36) = 6.51, p < .05, ² =.15. Participants who had listened to the prosocial songs (weighted M = 7.05) felt moreempathy than those who had listened to the neutral songs (weighted M = 5.78). Theinteraction was not significant, F(1, 36) = 0.22, p = .64, ² = .01. Finally, participant sex hadno significant effect on empathy, F(1, 36) = 1.11, p = .30, ² = .03.Liking of songs did not differ among experimental conditions. In addition, whencontrolling for liking, the effect for type of song on empathy remained significant, F(1, 34) =6.14, p < .05, ² = .15.To summarize, Experiment 2 revealed that exposure to songs with prosocial lyricsfostered interpersonal empathy. In concert with Experiment 1, findings of Experiment 2suggest that exposure to prosocial media activates two of the main routes (cognition andaffect) proposed by GLM on how media exposure influences behavior.Experiment 3After Experiments 1 and 2 have shown that exposure to songs with prosocial contentaffects cognition and affect that, as outlined by GLM, may instigate behavioral reactions,Experiment 3 examines whether listening to prosocial songs indeed affects prosocial action. Itwas expected that listening to prosocial (relative to neutral) songs would foster prosocialbehavior.MethodParticipants and design. Participants were 90 students (55 women, 35 men) of theLMU. They received 2 (approximately $3.20) for their participation. There were 45participants in the prosocial condition and 45 participants in the neutral condition.Procedure and materials. At the onset, participants were welcomed by two femaleexperimenters and learned that they would participate in a marketing survey on musicpreferences. Then, the second experimenter left the room, and the participants listened to theACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTprosocial songs 12songs. After listening to the songs, the first experimenter left the room, and the secondexperimenter, who was unaware of the participant’s experimental condition, reentered theroom. She gave the participants the 2 , and explained that the university was collectingdonations for a non-profit organization. Participants were told that it would be great if theywould donate these 2 but that it would be also fine if they did not donate. Upon saying this,the experimenter pointed at a box on which the non-profit organization’s information wasprinted. The experimenter left the room for 2 min and then returned. Finally, participants wereprobed for suspicion, debriefed, and thanked. None of the participants indicated anyrelatedness among listening to the songs and the donation to the non-profit organization. Themoney was indeed donated to the non-profit organization.Note that—because measurement of the possible mediators may prime the concept forall participants and thus change subsequent measures of pro- and antisocial action—prosocialbehavior was assessed, but no possible mediators (see Spencer, Zanna, & Fong, 2005). In fact,previous research into the effects of violent video games (e.g., Lindsay & Anderson, 2000)has shown that measuring aggressive cognitions changes subsequent measures of aggressivebehavior.Results and DiscussionAs predicted, participants who had listened to the prosocial songs were more likely todonate money than participants who had listened to the neutral songs, ²(1, N = 90) = 4.56, p< .05, w = .27. Of the 45 participants who had listened to the prosocial songs, 24 donated. Ofthe 45 participants who had listened to the neutral songs, 14 donated. That is, 53% of theprosocial song condition helped, whereas 31% in the neutral song game condition did so.Participant sex had no significant effect on donating, ²(1, N = 90) = 0.12, p = .73.In summary, listening to songs with prosocial lyrics increased helping behavior. Thus,after Experiments 1 and 2 have shown that prosocial songs influence cognition and affect,ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTprosocial songs 13which—according to GLM—are two of the main routes on how media exposure leads tobehavior, Experiment 3 in fact revealed that exposure to prosocial media promoted prosocialreactions. However, because prosocial behavior and the possible mediators were assessed indifferent studies, it remains unclear whether accessibility of prosocial thoughts and/orinterpersonal empathy indeed constitute the mediating path from media exposure to action. Inthe present research, I wanted to provide first evidence for the effects of listening to prosocialsongs on prosocial cognitions, affects, and behaviors. Clarifying the exact causal mechanismsawaits future research.General DiscussionThe aim of the present research was to examine the hypothesis that exposure toprosocial media fosters prosocial tendencies. In fact, listening to prosocial (relative to neutral)songs increased the accessibility of prosocial thoughts, led to more empathy, and instigatedprosocial action. Whereas previous research has demonstrated that violent media increasedaggression-related thoughts, feeling, and behavior (Bushman & Huesmann, 2006), the presentresearch shows that media with prosocial content result in prosocial tendencies. Thus, mediaexposure affects social behavior and related variables not only negatively, but may also do sopositively (see Greitemeyer & Osswald, 2007, for the effects of prosocial video games onprosocial behavior). Note also that across studies the effect for song exposure on thoughts,feeling, and behavior was medium to large.Theoretical Implications, Limitations, and Future ResearchAs noted above, using the GAM as a framework, there has been abundant researchdemonstrating detrimental consequences of exposure to violent media on aggression-relatedvariables. To also account for positive effects of media exposure, this model has beenexpanded into the GLM (Buckley & Anderson, 2006), but, as yet, the predictive validity ofthe GLM for the effects of exposure to prosocial media on prosocial tendencies has not beenACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTprosocial songs 14tested. Thus, the present studies constitute the first empirical evidence that the effects ofmedia exposure on social tendencies indeed depend to a great extent on the content of themedia being consumed.As proposed by GLM, the present set of studies showed that listening to songs withprosocial lyrics affected behavioral reactions as well as an individual’s internal states(cognition and affect) that are assumed to elicit behavior. However, as noted above, thepresent research did not address whether exposure to prosocial media indeed led to behavioralreactions through these internal states. Thus, future research assessing internal states as wellas behavioral reactions in one study would be informative in this regard. Nevertheless, basedon the present results, it appears that the aim of GLM to bring the effects of media exposureon pro- and antisocial tendencies together within a common theoretical framework is not onlya valuable endeavor, but is also supported by empirical evidence.Previous research has demonstrated that violent media increased aggression anddecreased prosocial behavior (Anderson & Bushman, 2001). Here, evidence was presentedthat listening to prosocial songs increased prosocial behavior. Thus, future research mayexamine whether exposure to prosocial songs does not only increase prosocial tendencies, butalso decreases aggression and aggression-related variables.The reader should be well aware that the present results are limited to the short-term:the effects of listening to prosocial songs on immediate thoughts, affects, and behaviors wereexamined. However, repeated exposure to media may affect long-term behavior (Huesmann& Miller, 1994). According to GLM, repeated encounters with prosocial media may yieldlong term changes in personality through the development and construction of knowledgestructures. In addition, the present results materialized even though participants listened toonly two songs. In real life, when people may repeatedly listen to prosocial songs, the positiveeffects on prosocial behavior might be even more pronounced. Thus, the media does not onlyACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTprosocial songs 15increase the likelihood of aggressive and violent behavior, but could be also effectively usedto improve social interactions.ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTprosocial songs 16ReferencesAnderson, C.

Thus, although during debriefing none of the participants indicatedawareness of the true purpose of the experiment, future research using thoughtaccessibility tasks that do not require conscious expression of remembering (such as areading reaction time task or a lexical decision task) and are thus not as easily affectedby demand characteristics as direct memory tasks would be of interest.
