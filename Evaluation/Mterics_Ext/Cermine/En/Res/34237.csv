It is an especially important phenomenon for federalstates, since existing democratic regimes and federalism as a form of the state areconsidered relevant internal factors for the development of international relations ofsubnational governments (Vigevani 2006). Therefore, although it is not a phenomenonunique to federal states, the international insertion of non-central government hasdeveloped with some frequency and success in this form of state which makes this arelevant theme for the understanding of the contemporary contours of federalism.This development has meant that some federations have adapted their legislationto draw up the perspectives and limits of the international action of sub-nationalgovernments. Brazil is part of a group of states where non-central governments,reaching beyond the national borders, have formed without a legal framework dictatingthe process. This article seeks to understand how Brazilian national legal regulationshave dealt with this phenomenon and how the process of legal framing ofparadiplomacy is developing to meet the challenges this trend engenders.Initially, I analyze the actions of sub-national governments in internationaldevelopment, concentrating specifically on the causes themselves and their growth.Then the tendencies of the constitutionalization of the international relationsundertaken by sub-national governments will be examined, before moving on to reviewthe efforts to make it part of the law system in Brazil. Finally, I review theconsequences of un-constitutionalized paradiplomacy.1. The Development of ParadiplomacyParadiplomacy refers to international action by non-central governments2 (Soldatos1990).3 Widespread international action of federal entities began before the 1970s and1980s. Explanations for this development range from factors internal to federationsthrough to aspects acquired by the international system in recent decades (Keating1999, Romero 2004).Within federal states the drivers of paradiplomacy often include the division ofcompetencies and autonomy given to sub-units through federative pacts. The need formembers of the federation to fulfill competencies laid out by Constitutional charters123Academically, it would be correct to use the term “sub-state governments”, given thedistinction between State and Nation. However, due to the fact that it is generally accepted inliterature, the expression “sub-national governments” will be used in this paper. In the sameway, the term “non-central governments” will be used to refer to these entities, in contrast to“central governments”.The term “non-central government” should be understood in a broad way, meaning aconstituent unit of a federal country or an administrative division of a unitary state.On possible discussions about the nomenclature, see: Zabala 2000; Romero 2004.Andrade e Barros, Legal framing of Paradiplomacy: The case of Brazil”40requires that members seek ways of meeting local and regional demands not fully metby the central government. Furthermore states’ reduced participation in their nationaleconomies in the 1980s and 1990s with the spread of neo-liberal economic policybegan to be seen as an important instrument for the improvement of sub-nationalpublic policies. This movement is facilitated, in the case of federations, because ofgreater autonomy granted by central governments; unlike what has been seen to occurin unitary states.Also the evolution of the international system in recent decades has drivenparadiplomacy. The beginning of international action by non-central governments tookplace in the larger context of the democratization of the international system; a processthat began after the Second World War (Sassen 2001.) Therefore an important changeoccurred in the once exclusively inter-state system which had dominated theinternational arena since the 17th century. Although states remain the primary actors inthis scenario, the acceleration of international flows – or globalization – and thedevelopment of regional integration processes have facilitated the emergence ofimportant new players to a once foreign sphere.The processes of globalization and regional integration create favorable conditionsfor the increased action of sub-national governments in the foreign sphere. Waves ofmigration for example, bring about the need for non-central governments to deal withcultural and linguistic diversity that increase the probability of closer bonds with foreigninstitutions and governments. Furthermore, the expansion of multinational corporationshas meant that sub-national governments need to develop policies focused oneconomic internationalization, preparing their population and territory for the arrival offoreign investments.The changes accompany a corresponding change in the approach of internationalproblem solving; moving from a state-centric approach to one welcoming input fromconstituent units. The perception that regional and local level governments must beincluded in problem-solving efforts related to these issues led to a greaterconsideration of these spheres in efforts of international agencies and organizations.4There is a tendency for paradiplomacy to supplement the activities of non-centralgovernments in their sphere of competence with the unique aspect that they go beyondnational frontiers. In extremely rare cases, the international relations of sub-nationalgovernments go against the foreign policy of the federal government or encroach intojurisdictions outside of a given non-central government. 545Therefore, during the 1990s, the United Nations held large conferences which were driversfor sub-national governments, and, above all, the local powers were able to establishthemselves on the international scene (Rodrigues 2004, p. 441). Along the same line, in2000, the United Nations launched the Goals of the Millenium, considered one of the mostimportant programs currently run by the institution. Through this, the UN has sought toinvolve regional and local governments, understanding that the solution for the big problemsaffecting states today need to be dealt with at the sub-national level.This kind of foreign relations by sub-national governments is called protodiplomacy and hasbeen more widely studied in the autonomous regions of Spain (Segura 2004).Andrade e Barros, Legal framing of Paradiplomacy: The case of Brazil”41In Brazil paradiplomacy started to move forward more firmly in the 1980s, with theredemocratization of the country after years of military dictatorship.6 A symbol of thenew democratic phase, the federal constitution of 1988 formally entrenched the right ofcommon citizens to participate in the democratic process. The constitution incorporatedboth the relevance of consensus and the need for the participation of minorities.However the constitution also brought considerable administrative and politicaldecentralization through greater tax distribution and an extension of the sharing ofcompetences between federal entities. There is a greater autonomy of member statesand,7 since they gained greater autonomy over the budgets, a larger number ofcompeting competences.8During the 1980s, following the paths of the world economy and the crisis of thedevelopment-state based ideology of the 1970s; the Brazilian economy went throughan important period of adjustments. Brazil joined the new wave of economic liberalismthat affected most of the Western world. As part of the adaptation to this new context,the federal government started an intensified process of economic deregulation, theprivatization of public corporations and opening to foreign capital. In practice, thismeant a reduction of the nation state in domestic affairs and a greater opening to theinternational market.During the transition to economic liberalism, a reduction in the economic andfinancial actions of the central government created a vacuum. This vacuum was thenfilled by the sub-national entities and municipalities of Brazil. The seizing ofopportunities provided by foreign investment appeared as an appealing alternative toother options that were advanced to deal with the issues which were arising (Barreto2004). Brazilian sub-national governments have being specially active in seekinginternational loans and attracting foreign investments by tax incentives for multinationalenterprises.There is some consensus in the literature about what promotes internationalorganizations to seek constituent level input in federations. Michael Keating was one ofthe first scholars to define three general groups of such motivations that fit the Braziliansituation, these causes are economic, political and cultural (Keating 2004). In theeconomic sphere, it is sought after international funding, as well as foreign investmentsand increased exports of locally produced goods. In the political sphere, agreements6 It is true that some international actions of member states can be seen since the 1960s.There was the protest of the then Governor of the State of Rio Grande do Sul against thefederal government for not taking part in the negotiations for the creation of the LatinAmerican Free Trade Association and also the creation of the International RelationsSecretariat in the State of Minas Gerais. Although they were important initiatives bringing thetheme of internationalization to sub-national governments, they were isolated initiatives.7 The 1988 federal constitution included the municipalities as members of the Brazilianfederation, inaugurating a three-way federal system.8 This does not mean, however, that Brazil is a truly decentralized federation. With theconstitution of 1988 there was a move towards decentralization, when compared to previousperiods, but the country still has a strongly centralized structure.Andrade e Barros, Legal framing of Paradiplomacy: The case of Brazil”42are made to empower local public policies and disseminate best practices as well ascarry the needs of sub-national governments to the international system – throughnetworks of cities and bilateral agreements, for example. In the cultural sphere, sub-national governments seek agreements that deal with migratory flows and which allowgreater visibility to increase tourism.Therefore, it can be seen that the pragmatics of paradiplomacy in Brazil – as wellas in other countries where this phenomenon occurs – can involve a variety ofagreements from contracts to international agreements. There are different degrees ofcommitment taken on by sub-national governments which raises questions about thelegal aspects of the phenomenon.2. Tendencies of Constitutionalization of Paradiplomacy in Federal StatesInternational law only recognizes as unquestioned legal entities the states andinternational organizations – as well as a few entities close to these two categories(Shaw, 2003). Therefore, from the traditional view of international relations, there is noclear answer as to what the legal reach of sub-national governments is the internationalsystem. To rectify this issue, governments should turn to national norms as guidelinesto define acceptable state action (Pellet 2002). This depends essentially on the degreeof decentralization of the federation: the higher decentralization is the greater theprobability of constitutional permission for paradiplomacy.The Brazilian federal constitution does not foresee international relationshipsbetween sub-national governments, the federal district (Brasília, the federal capital)and municipalities (Rodrigues 2008, p. 1019). In spite of this, the practice of foreigninteraction with states has become deeper and more widespread among the sub-national governments. The distance between practice and law in the sphere ofparadiplomacy has a reason. It is difficult to create an appropriate legal framework thatcan deal with the complexity of the process, as well as its dynamics.However the constitutionalization of paradiplomacy may bring restrictions to theinternational action of the sub-national entities. Therefore, in understanding theobstacles of a possible constitutional reform, it is important to analyze the standardsadopted by federal states in adapting their legal frameworks with regard to (a) the kindof norms utilized, and (b) the material competencies designated, as well as (c) thelimits established.a) Norms: By definition, the federal constitution is the basic document which dealswith the division of competencies between federated entities; therefore, it should be themain instrument to define the possibility and the limits of paradiplomacy (Rezek 2005.)With paradiplomacy foreseen in the constitution, it follows the principle of legality,inherent to administrative law which means that all actions of the public administrationshould be guided by law. The federal constitution should establish the areas whereinvolvement of the sub-national entities would be suitable and, therefore, underline theAndrade e Barros, Legal framing of Paradiplomacy: The case of Brazil”43centralization of power-- whether in the federation itself, or in the member states(Moraes 1998, p. 28).Therefore, in most cases, the rules regulating international actions by members ofthe federation have been done through constitutional amendments. That is whathappened in Belgium, with the constitutional reform of 1993, in Argentina in 1994 and,in Austria in 2002. A different understanding of the issue occurred in the Mexicanfederation, which chose to normatize paradiplomacy through an infra-constitutional law.In spite of the outspoken disagreement of the local constitutionalists with regard to thesuitability of this decree (Abraham 2007, p. 280). Since 1992 Mexico has had the “Lawof Celebration of Treaties” which widens the possibility of international participation withsome autonomy by sub-national entities. Therefore, although the Mexican constitutionaffirms the impossibility of international agreements by non-central governments, aninfra-constitutional norm admits this possibility.b) Material competences: With regard to the issues about which the federalsubunits may deal with in international agreements, it is usually established that theymay make agreements on any issue within their sphere of competence. The Swissconstitution, for example, foresees the possibility of agreements between cantons andforeign states, in which they must limit themselves to the competences of federatedentities. The German constitution is similar, indicating the possibility of member statescelebrating international agreements in the sphere of their attributions. The AustrianConstitution, which indicates that the Länder may sign treaties with states ofneighboring Austria or with other states, as long as they are within the competencesattributed to them.To a lesser extent, there are cases in which federated entities only deal withissues related to their exclusive competences. This occurs often in Belgium. Althoughin theory the Belgian Constitution allows for the possibility of agreements bycommunities and regions on issues within their competence, in practice, theseagreements mostly focus on issues of education and culture, which are exclusivecompetences of sub-national governments. In practical terms, there is in the Belgiancase, a sharing of competences on treaties issues.The fact is that, without exception, legal provisions dealing with paradiplomacypigeon-hole state government into dealing with issues of low politics; like trade, cultureand those issues that are not directly related to sovereignty or national security. Thiscan be seen in the constitutional dynamics of the federated states, which attributes tothe central government the competence to deal with issues related to high politics.9c) Limits: The constitutionalization of paradiplomacy does not occur withoutprecise limits. Besides the issue of delineating competences, there are also procedurallimits for sub-national governments to operate internationally. The most common9There has been some discussion about the possibility of classifying issues as low politicsand high politics, since that, in an interdependent world, they tend to overlap with somefrequency, see Ripsman 2004.Andrade e Barros, Legal framing of Paradiplomacy: The case of Brazil”44constraint is of prior approval of the federal sphere. The agencies responsible forapproval vary. Some states grant the executive power; for example the ministryresponsible for foreign affairs has the authority to approve or not approve a negotiationor agreement. In others, the Legislative branch has the power to approve theseagreements.This limit imposed by some constitutions – in fact most of them – has a negativeimplication on the dynamics of paradiplomacy. The international actions of non-centralgovernments begin even before there is a constitutional reference about them – as inthe Brazilian case. Therefore, when the matter becomes constitutionalized and beginsto require that every agreement should be previously approved by a centralgovernment agency, the celerity of the movement is lost. Some interesting solutionshave been found to counter-act this problem. In Austria, the federal government mustbe informed by the governor of the Land before negotiations of an internationalagreement are initiated and then it has eight weeks to issue a decision. If there is norefusal during this period, it is tacitly understood that the request has been approved,and the state government may start the negotiations.Another interesting case is that of the United States. The federal constitution saysthat the federated subunits may have agreements abroad, with the stipulation that thestate has the approval of U.S. Congress for the agreement to take effect. Theinterpretation of this condition was initially restrictive, in the understanding thatCongress should be consulted about any foreign actions by non-central governments.The intensification of paradiplomacy increased the scope – which was possible mostlydue to the fact that the United States is governed by a common law system. With thedramatic increase of the number of agreements signed by single states today, there isnot full compliance with the constitutional requirement of a consultation to the U.S.Congress (Lessa 2002, p. 41.) Many of these agreements are carried out directlybetween the parties to save time. U.S. Congress itself, understanding the risk of itsoperations could be compromised due to the number of agreements to be approved,has interpreted that only agreements which interfere with security and the guidelines ofnational foreign policy should be examined (Branco 2006, p.71.)The policy of approval works both ways as there can also be issues ofcompatibility with the foreign policy followed by central government. This fact is relatedto the classical view that the nation state should be seen as a unit in the internationalsystem. This would be mitigated by policies on paradiplomacy that did not follow theguidelines dictated by central government. In the same way, internal governabilitycould be damaged if agreements of sub-national governments went against theinterests of the federal government. This issue arises in commitments taken on by thefederal state. The agreements should not fail to harmonize with previous obligationsassumed by central government whether in the national or international spheres.Andrade e Barros, Legal framing of Paradiplomacy: The case of Brazil”453. In search of a legally ordained paradiplomacy in BrazilIn recent years, the discussion on the need to legally ordain paradiplomacy has led toan attempt to constitutionalize the matter as well as some efforts at infra-constitutionallegal framing.In 2005 the constitutional amendment proposal no. 475 was sent to the Braziliancongress. The amendment no. 475 regulated the action of member states, the federaldistrict and municipalities internationally. It did so through an addition to theconstitutional law that dealt with competences common to federated entities. Ifapproved, the constitution would state that these entities could bring about acts andsign agreements or contracts with sub-national foreign governments, as long as theconstitutional competences for each entity were followed and the competences whichare exclusive to the union be avoided. The constitution, justice, and citizenshipcommittee of the national congress argued that the lack of explicit permission in theconstitution about international actions by federated members was not sufficient reasonto forbid it. The argument of the committee, although contrary to the majority view onthis issue, which states the need for the competences of federated entities to be statedin the constitution, prevailed and the constitutional amendment proposal was rejected.This was followed by attempts of non-constitutional legal framing. There is aproposal in senate today10 substituting white paper supplementary law no. 98 from2006. This proposal rules on the possibility of member states, municipalities andfederal district to act in the foreign sphere through signing agreements, which shouldbe examined previously by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is difficult to imagine howapproval could be attained with efficiency for Brazilian municipalities, which todaynumber over 5,500.Besides the substitution proposal, there are two protocols in congress, signed bythe Brazilian federal government with the governments of France and Italy that seek toprovide a framework for paradiplomacy between the states in agreements. Theprotocols indicate the importance of this movement and establish possible modalities ofthe action of sub-national governments – in areas of their competence – as well as theneed for prior consent of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for the signing of agreements.4. Consequences of the lack of legal framingThe lack of legal framing of paradiplomacy has both positive and negativeconsequences in the Brazilian case. There a legitimate concern by the sub-nationalgovernments that, in inserting paradiplomacy in the legal framework, the limits are toowide and the process becomes limited. These are almost inherent consequences tophenomena that develop outside legal principles. To imagine that each negotiation oragreement carried out today at the initiative of sub-national governments has then tobe submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the national congress is very10 As of the writing of this paper in July 2010.Andrade e Barros, Legal framing of Paradiplomacy: The case of Brazil”46disturbing for those who are already part of the process and this is not because of theconcern that the agreement might be refused. Paradiplomacy in Brazil, in spite of thelack of an actual legal framework, does not tend to usurp competences of otherspheres or to act contrary to the foreign policy of the country. The greater concern isthe amount of red tape that will bind down a process that ought to be dynamic in orderto truly attain its objectives.On the other hand, a negative consequence of the lack of constitutionalization ofthe phenomenon is the lack of guidance on the practice of sub-national internationalrelations. Also, an important concern is the possibility that state and municipal publicadministration could have their actions questioned in court or in a court of auditorsbecause they are beyond their constitutional competences. So far this has not occurredfor the executive power11. However, it is necessary to observe that the forms ofinteraction of non-central governments in the international system have becomesophisticated, which raises the possibility of some kind of inspection.Another important issue related to the lack of a legal framework is theresponsibility for international agreements that are not upheld. In the Brazilian case, itis not clear who would be responsible for default on agreements made by sub-nationalgovernments. With the possibility of new government cycles, this hypothesis isespecially serious because of the possible default on commitments assumed byprevious governments.ConclusionAs happened in other countries, Brazil faces a troublesome dichotomy on theconstitutionalization of paradiplomacy. There is no easy answer to the issue since thecontours of possible legislation on the theme can vary stalling the process. It is truethat the debates on the issue in Brazil are still at too early a stage to draw up anadequate legal framing. Carrying out a constitutional reform that is coherent both withthe Brazilian legal system and the demands of the federal government and of the sub-national governments seems unlikely at this time. This does not, however, reduce theimportance of deepening the dialogue. On the contrary, it reaffirms the need.11 There are two lawsuits by the Rio Grande do Sul Public Prosecutor’s Office in NovoHamburgo, questioning travel by town counselors accompanying the mayor on trips abroad.One of them is against 24 counselors and ex-counselors for mismanagement of publicresources because of trips in 2004, 2005 and 2007. Besides those that benefited with theirexpenses being paid, the Public Prosecutor’s Office also targets counselors who voted in theplenary in favor of the trips to France, China and the Iberian Peninsula. According to thecounselors, the missions had the purpose of drawing together Brazilian and foreigncompanies and getting to know the technology of the countries visited. Another lawsuit refersto trips to India in 2008. The Public Prosecutor’s Office does not question the possibility ofmunicipal authorities defending local interests in the foreign sphere, but the need forrepresentatives from the Legislative to do so (Dutra 2008).Andrade e Barros, Legal framing of Paradiplomacy: The case of Brazil”47Paradiplomacy is an important tool to reaffirm the idea of a national project thatseeks greater development and greater autonomy for its subunits. In this context, beingable to rely on institutional and legal frameworks that extend the chances of bringingthis into effect is a way of assisting in the balance of federative agreement.Andrade e Barros, Legal framing of Paradiplomacy: The case of Brazil”48References<ref>[1] Abraham, L. 2007, “La cooperación descentralizada pública en México: La hora</ref>ha llegado” in: Anuario de la cooperación descentralizada 2006.
