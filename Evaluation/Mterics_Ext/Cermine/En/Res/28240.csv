Among the changes that affected the Mbororowere the following: a new legal-institutional framework (the 1996 Constitu-tion), the consequences of the multi-party competition since 1990, and themobilisation outside of political parties in the framework of an associationfor the promotion of ethnic interests (the MBOSCUDA, founded 1992).The combination of these factors has led to a Mbororo political awakening.This contribution aims to better understand the determinants and key play-ers in this development.Manuscript received 4 July 2011; accepted 28 November 2011Keywords: Cameroon, democratisation, political participation, minoritygroups, MbororoIbrahim Mouiche is a political scientist specialising in Political Sociologyand Political Anthropology.

The causes andconsequences of this profound change are largely unknown. The on-goingdebate (sometimes accompanied by violence) on the link between citizen-ship and autochthony first appears rather disadvantageous for a group asunstable as the Mbororo. But the state-sponsored policy of settlement, ini-tially viewed with suspicion, has affected the Mbororo favourably, especiallysince it was associated with better schooling, producing a critical mass of“elites”. There was a Mbororo “political awakening” in the context ofchanges in areas including but not limited to the following: the effects of anew legal-institutional framework (the 1996 Constitution), the consequencesof competition between political parties since 1990 (even in a system that isfar from being a democracy), and mobilisation outside of political parties bythe Mbororo Social and Cultural Development Association of Cameroon(MBOSCUDA), since 1992.This matter merits reflection when one considers that under the single-party system (1966–1990/91), the Mbororo, semi-settled Fulani herdsmen,had always maintained a distance vis-à-vis the Cameroonian state: Theircontact with the administration was for a long time limited to simply payingtax on livestock. Apart from this, the Cameroonian government did notneed the Mbororo. In turn, the Mbororo did not need the state (Davis 1995:1The term “marginal” refers to the people who are distinguished by their way of life,characterised mainly by the physical instability (nomadic, semi-nomadism or trans-humance) and the extreme precariousness of their material condition, which re-duces them to a situation of extreme dependence on their natural environment(forests, pastures, etc.). They generally live by hunting, fishing, gathering, or barter,and sometimes engage in subsistence farming using the most rudimentary tech-niques (Donfack Sokeng 2001: 113, see Barbier 1981: 239-260). The Mbororo andthe Pygmies have been identified by the United Nations and by themselves as “in-digenous peoples”, i.e., communities who have in common, in principle, historicalcontinuity with a specific region before colonisation and a close relationship withtheir land; they maintain at least in part, separate social, economic and political sys-tems. They have different languages, cultures, beliefs and knowledge systems andare determined to preserve and develop their identity and separate institutions.They also form a non-dominant, marginalised and discriminated sector within soci-ety (Shulte-Tenckhof 1997). But in Cameroon, as elsewhere in Africa, the situationis complicated by the fact that the United Nations and its Working Group on In-digenous Peoples adopted the concept of “autochtone” as the official translation of“indigenous” (indigène). However, it has a very different meaning than the word“autochtone” has in Francophone countries, where autochthones are rarely mar-ginal groups but rather dominant groups that control the state (see Geschiere2009).Democratisation and Political Participation of Mbororo73220). But since the return to multi-party politics in 1990, the masquerade ofelectoral competition and the pursuit of electoral votes made the Mbororoattractive to candidates, in contrast to the situation during to the single-partyperiod, when the Mbororo hardly ever voted.How deep does this political participation run? What are the key criteriafor success? These are the main framing questions of this analysis, whichoriginated from the work I have been carrying out for quite some time inthe West Region on the dominant groups, the Bamun and Bamileke. I real-ised recently that research on dominant groups is incomplete without look-ing at the dominated groups, the ethnic minorities, on a sub-national level.This shift of attention has required a degree of openness regarding the inter-action between Mbororo and “native” farmers, be they dominant or in aminority position. In this way, my approach was exploratory. To achievethese goals, I used three research techniques: I examined written sources andconducted both interviews and focus group discussions.First, I consulted written sources, which consisted of literature (books,newspapers, magazine articles, Internet sources, etc.) on the Mbororo andthe surrounding farming groups: the Bamun, the Bamileke, the Tikar, andothers. While consulting Internet sources, I found that the assumed margin-ality of the Mbororo clashed with the high public exposure of their prob-lems in these various media. Primary sources consisted of papers issued bythe Mbororo themselves, essentially MBOSCUDA documents, which Iaccessed through administrative and municipal archives. The research, car-ried out by way of semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions,led me to several other localities in the West, and more broadly in NounDivision, where the concentration of Mbororo is highest. I also conductedinterviews with Mbororo residents and many elites in Yaoundé, the capitalof Cameroon, and in the city of Jakiri in the Northwest Region, with the aimof obtaining data for comparison. The focus group discussions were con-ducted with Mbororo “elites” (administrative, political and traditional) andmany ordinary citizens among the farmer groups.In the following, I will first describe the socio-political context, thensuccessively analyse the degree of political participation of the Mbororo inthe West Region, the determinants of participation and, finally, their politicalawakening, from a comparative perspective.22As a fellow at the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and having been a guestscholar at the GIGA Institute of African Affairs in Hamburg, I took advantage ofthe infrastructure and logistics available to me to rewrite and complete this paper.

The Bamileke are grouped into seven divisions (Bamboutos,Upper Nkam, the Upper Plateau, Kung-Khi, Menoua, Mifi, and Nde) andone hundred chiefdoms. In those divisions, the density reaches more than200 inhabitants per square kilometre. The Bamun kingdom itself keeps thesame boundaries as Noun Division, covering an area of 7,687 square kilo-metres, or 55.35 per cent of the West Region (see Mouiche 2005: chap. 2).Apart from these two dominant groups, the region’s population is made upof eight sizeable ethnic minorities that can be grouped into two categories:The first is made up of ethnic groups previously established and residing inthe Bamileke-dominated area: the Mbo, the Banen, the Bakua, the Dibum(or Yabassi); in the Bamun land we find the Tikar. The second group isformed out of “late-comers”, groups that arrived even after the Europeans:the Poakam in the Bamun land,3 and the Mbororo, found in both theBamun and Bamileke highlands.The Hegemony of the “Native Farmers”In Cameroon, the relationship between the government and pastoralists isalmost always characterised by – mostly failing – settlement policies. Amongthe exceptions is the case of the Mbororo who inhabit the West Region. Thehigh plateaus and wet vegetation dominated by grasslands are quite suitablefor pastoral activities. Nomadism was abandoned when the population an-chored itself at its wintering site and adopted a transhumance practice, thecattle breeders delegating more and more of their flocks to third parties.How did the Mbororo become sedentary? Among the geographical featuresthat made the lifestyle transition at all possible, the altitude seems to play themost important role: The wintering sites are frequently above 1,500 meters,an altitudinal threshold that changes the cultural conditions. The settlementwas also the result of an authoritative policy of the administration associatedwith improved pastures.434their comments. This article, including the quotations from French-languagesources, was translated from French into English for Africa Spectrum.The Pouakam arrived in the late 1960s in the Bamun kingdom, well after theMbororo (and post-colonially), but they have acquired the status of native.On the process and impact of settlement on the Western Mbororo, see JohnBoutrais (1984: 225-256).Democratisation and Political Participation of Mbororo75Though the natural features of the West Region are very suitable forcattle breeding, the socio-political context is disadvantageous for theMbororo. Indeed, farmers exert an unchallenged supremacy over breeders.This is first of all due to a numerical supremacy but also a political suprem-acy in the broadest sense. Most of the West, particularly the Bamileke Plat-eau, is more or less reserved for farmers whose settlements have populationdensities of 200 to 300 inhabitants (or more) per square kilometre. Theresult is that land for cattle grazing comprises less than 10 per cent of thearea of the country. Land saturation and the increase of cultivated areas haveprevented the expansion of livestock. There are few areas left for breedingin Bana, the Bamboutos Mountains and the Galim area. Pastures in theBamboutos Mountains are considered the largest and richest in Bamilekecountry, one reason the colonial authorities reserved their exclusive use forEuropean cattle breeders (see Champaud 1983: 321; Fark-Grüninger 1995:111). The population density in rural Bamun is much lower, ranging be-tween 20 to 40 people per square kilometre. However, this occupancy rate ishardly suitable for extensive livestock farming. But as the cultivation areasare not equally distributed, some open lands remain available to pastoralists.It is due to the advantages of this region of Bamun that the Mbororo haveestablished many colonies there.The difficulties of the Mbororo are related not only to their minoritystatus but also to the recentness of their settling, to which the “native”farmers have reacted negatively. Here it may be useful to pose a few simplequestions: Are the Mbororo regarded in the West (by the Bamileke, Bamun,Mbo, Tikar, farmers, etc.) as autochthons? Do they enjoy full citizenshiprights? What about their official recognition as “indigenous people” in Cam-eroon? Let us start with a related reflection: The situation in the West Re-gion is broadly comparable to that of the neighbouring English-speakingNorthwest Region, which is better studied (see Duni et al. 2009; Pelican2008: 540-560; Boutrais 1984: 225-256). Indeed, there is no documented,historical, pre-colonial continuity of the Mbororo in any part of today’sWest and Northwest Regions of Cameroon. As pastoralists, they have neverconsidered buying and thus owning their grazing lands, so in the absence ofterritoriality they are considered “migrants” – and in a more negative sensethey are considered “strangers” by neighbouring farmers, who see them-selves as “landowners” and the Mbororo as their “guests” (see Pelican 2008:540-560). To put it simply, the contrasts between the two groups are strong:The farmers are subsumed under the broader Bantu culture, while theMbororo relate to the Fulani cultures that are scattered across the Sahellands of West Africa. The divergence of economic interests between the twopopulations always manifests itself in a latent (though at times open) con-76Ibrahim Mouicheflict. The most common causes of confrontations are the extension of set-tlements at the expense of pastureland, and the damage caused to land andproperty by herds.The Mbororo: A People on the Margins ofSocio-political DevelopmentBy observing the extent of the Mbororo ethno-cultural area, one quicklydetects a lack of social infrastructure, especially in health and education (seeSalé 1991; Burnham 1996; Duni et al. 2009). All children (girls and boys)have a Quranic education, and almost all acquire a good command of theQuran before the age of fourteen, a feat that is due to the inexpensive na-ture of this education and how well suited it is to the kind of life theMbororo lead. However, there is a problem in terms of “modern” basiceducation: According to a study conducted by Abouamé Salé on theMbororo in Noun Division, only 2 out of 100 Mbororo children attendschool today. Only 3 of every 1,000 students in the Noun are Mbororo, andgirls make up a mere 16 per cent of registered Mbororo schoolchildren; byhigh school, this percentage drops to just 12 (Salé 1991: 40). The Mbororogenerally have very little access to higher education, with few going beyondForm 4. Pastoralism requires a lot of constant work by a large number ofpeople; even school-age children are often needed.Administratively, the relations between the Mbororo and the Came-roonian state remain remote. This verbal attack made by the senior divi-sional officer of Bui, Northwest Region, in a meeting with the Mbororosums up their complex and ambiguous relationship:You Mbororo people are tearing yourselves apart instead of comingtogether like the rest of Cameroon. You call yourselves an abandonedpeople? Who abandoned you? You abandoned yourselves! Keepingaway from others, keeping away from me! How do you expect me tounderstand you when you keep away from me, keep away from otherswhen we are all here in the towns and you remain away from us, awayfrom everything, away from me – up in the hills out there in theBush!5Moreover, taking advantage of the low level of education of many Mbororo,some officials are harming Mbororo interests. In the interviews, theMbororo voiced a whole string of complaints against the administration. Afemale Mbororo informant enumerated some of the most frequently occur-ring issues they have to deal with: intimidation; harassment; extortion of5Davis 1995: 213; see also Burnham 1996: 129; Frantz 1993: 33-34.Democratisation and Political Participation of Mbororo77money; abusive corporal punishment by gendarmes; and unfair trials ofagro-pastoral conflicts (the farmer systematically winning against the dis-armed and helpless Mbororo), etc. “These greedy and heartless people con-sider the Mbororo their breastfeeders, or merely plantations from whichthey can draw their pensions!” said our female informant. “To satisfy theirpredatory instinct, they sometimes do not hesitate to ask for non-existingofficial documents, or to invoke unknown provisions in Cameroonian law.”6Politically, the Mbororo are generally characterised by their apathy,acknowledged as much within the communities as outside of them. As oneMbororo informant said, “It is not fair to say that a man from the Mbororois addicted to fighting [political rivals]. He talks about ‘plotique’ to mean brib-ery, lying, plots and so on.” This complements the view held by the non-Mbororo. A Mbo informant of Santchou describes the Mbororo stereo-types: “They are more interested in trade. [...] They do not take part inmeetings and do not complain. They are not ambitious because of their lackof education.” And finally, this Tikar of Magba said: “No Mbororo is in-cluded on our list [Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement (RDPC)Magba].7 They have little interest in politics but vote RDPC. [...] When put-ting together our lists of candidates, those who demand to be taken intoaccount are the Yamba, Musgum, Arabs and Kotoko.”8 In addition,Mbororo society is not centralised but rather built on the basis of small clanunits led by ardos (heads). These ardos appear nowhere in the organisationalcharts of the administration (which do, however, include other traditionalauthorities). In other words, they are not notable among the local chiefs, letalone “chiefs of the third degree”, like all the village leaders. Even worse forthe Mbororo, an ardo, no matter how important, remains under the authorityof the “native” village chief of the respective territorial administrative unit.Significant Progress Related to the SettlementThis analysis, however, should not obscure critical milestones in the processof national integration achieved through the Mbororo’s settlement and es-pecially the abandonment of some aspects of their previous lifestyle. Someof these milestones are in the field of education, in the establishment oftechnical services (see Salé 1991: 40 ff.), and in the quality of housing, thelatter of which many observers consider to be the barometer of the devel-opment of this community, which has experienced within just a few decades678Interview with Fadimatou Dairou, Yaoundé 15 May 2008.Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement (CPDM), better known in Cameroonunder the French abbreviation RDPC.Interviews in Magba, Santchou, Koutaba in April and May 2008.78Ibrahim Mouichesignificant changes in both its architecture and its architects. We should alsonot forget the not-too-distant past, when the construction of family housingwas done exclusively by women while the men went about their pastoraloccupations. In more concrete terms, one finds in today’s Didango, the“capital of the Mbororo in Noun Division” and the only settlement wherethe Mbororo have left the bush to settle completely, the existence of“mixed” marriages between the Mbororo and the Bamun. Here, Mbororoare landowners, and this is recognised by their neighbours (the Bamun). InDidango, the Mbororo engage in agriculture alongside their pastoral activi-ties. Furthermore, along with the presence of Mbororo intellectual elites,one also notes the emergence of a bourgeois capitalist elite that stands outfrom the group through its participation in the modern sectors of the econ-omy (hardware, food, transportation) in nearby city centres such as Kou-taba, Foumbot, Foumban and Bafoussam.What is striking about these social dynamics is the emergence and thegradual establishment of private property. The nouveau riche gradually inte-grate themselves into the field of the modern capitalist economy and arevectors of change in their community, a fact observable in the possession ofreal assets and access to food, water and electricity. The nouveau riche arealso factors of “social reproduction”, as they initiate their children into thisarea and send them to schools and specialised training centres; under thislies a sense of class consciousness, a logic of conservation, capable of sus-taining social relationships based on a vision of their integration into thecapitalist market society. Citizens with low or precarious social and eco-nomic positions have a relatively low propensity to participate (Mayer andPerrineau 1992: 23, 29). Following the progressive effects of schooling,members of the Mbororo community have increasingly acquired positions inthe administration of Cameroon (see Table 1). And in the context of theneopatrimonial Cameroon of today, to be a member of the administration isa good starting point for any strategy to occupy political space.Democratisation and Political Participation of Mbororo79Table 1: Mbororo Agents and Administrative Staff Native to Noun DivisionNamesSadouDaoudouFadimatouDairouHassanHamadouMohamadouAwolouIbrahim SaleIbrahimDjobairouSandaOumarouAminaDjamoLerahAmadouLevel of study andprofessionDegree in law; civiladministratorMaster’s degree inlaw; treasuryinspectorGCE/A level; vet-erinary surgeonGCE/A level; tele-communicationsengineerGCE/O level; state-trained nurseGCE/A levelDegree in econom-ics; teacher at tech-nical high schoolGCE/A levelGCE/A level; vet-erinary surgeonMe YoussoufLaw degree; bailiffSource: Author’s compilation.Post occupied nowSub-divisional officerMember of the financeadministrative staff inservice at YaoundéNsimalen InternationalAirportSub-divisional delegate forthe Ministry of Livestockof KoutabaMember of the Telecom-munication RegulatingBoard (ART) in YaoundéNurse at Tibati HospitalForeman at AES SONEL(electricity provider) inNkongsambaBailiff in NgaoundereHeadmaster of BankimTechnical SchoolExecutive at SGBC BankYaoundéPrivate veterinary surgeonin BafoussamVillage oforiginKoupaMenkeDidangoDidangoDidangoDidangoDidangoDidangoDidangoYoloDidango80Ibrahim MouicheCriteria for and Depth of Mbororo PoliticalParticipationWe have explored the Western Mbororo’s ethnographic and socio-politicalenvironment; we will now discuss their political participation in this newcontext of political liberalisation. We noted above how difficult it was forthem to vote under the one-party system; however, we must not forget thatdespite their political apathy in the implementation of the government’spolicy of national integration, the Mbororo had for a long time been associ-ated with the structures of the single party. This explains why, before 1990,two of their localities (Yolo and Didango) were provided with a local com-mittee of the UNC,9 then the RDPC, in the Bamun kingdom.10 However,there was no Mbororo representation at the upper level (sub-section andsection) despite the unsuccessful attempts, the first of their kind, of YerimaDairou and Lerah Amadou of Didango, to win the respective sub-sectionpresidencies of the RDPC (adult branch of the party) and the OJRDPC(youth organisation) in 1987. It is thus clear that this structural assimilationof the Mbororo by the UNC-RDPC was, after all, marginal since they werenot vested with power in the higher echelons of the party hierarchy.Lester W. Milbrath (1965: 18) has attempted to sketch out ranking indi-ces of political participation in which the holder of an electoral mandate issupposed to have covered all the other steps. But keeping in mind thisproblem of “political participation” – which, in describing the hierarchy offorms of political intervention, posits the existence of a continuum fromvoting to the exercise of state power – it is important to note fragmentationimposed by the division of political labour between the agents of the politi-cal sphere and other social agents. Thus, reading the political sections ofnewspapers, listening to political broadcasts on television and the radio, andengaging in political discussions does not involve any participation in thestruggle for leadership positions in the state apparatus. These are in factsigns of the attention paid to political events by people who can only beconsidered spectators. The same logic can be applied to the case of a personwhose vote expresses a desire for social conformity. In contrast, actuallybeing a candidate for election, exercising political responsibility, and taking910The UNC is the party of Cameroon’s first president, Ahmadou Ahidjo, a Fulanifrom Northern Cameroon; in 1985, under the leadership of President Biya, whohas been in power since 1982, the UNC became the RDPC.The RDPC is organised into four tiers at the local level: the cell (at the bottom), thelocal committee, the sub-section, and the section (at the top). Each organ has threebranches: the main branch for adults (RDPC), the female branch (OFRDPC), andthe youth branch (OJRDPC).Democratisation and Political Participation of Mbororo81part in activism within a party are different from the aforementioned activi-ties not only because they are believed to be time-consuming; these are ac-tivities that belong to other fields of social practice, usually performed byprofessionals or social agents whose lives revolve around politics (Gaxie1978: 42).Some questions emerge regarding the political participation of theMbororo: Unlike in the period of the single party, do multi-partyism andpolitical liberalisation now allow for the emergence of Mbororo candidatesin the national representative institutions? If so, what will the results be?From the perspective of leadership, do the Mbororo have leaders and politi-cal entrepreneurs likely to mobilise them? To what extent do they exerciseresponsibility within political parties, both ruling and oppositional? Since thefirst pluralist municipal elections, in 1996, more and more Mbororo havecompeted for council positions and some have even managed to get elected.Based on our field surveys, this political participation manifested itself, forexample, by the presence of 14 Mbororo candidates in the 2007 municipalelections in the West, related to three political parties. Seven of those 14were elected: one from the RDPC, the ruling party, two from the SocialDemocratic Front (SDF), and four from the Union Démocratique du Came-roun (UDC). Even more important, a Mbororo, Lerah Adamou of Didango,became town councillor in Bafoussam, the regional metropolis, under theaegis of the SDF. A closer inspection of the political participation of theMbororo in Noun Division is needed as they constitute here the largestcomponent of Mbororo in the West Region. Of particular importance is thepolitical career of Yerima Dairou, an elite Mbororo from Didango, who hassince died. In his day, he succeeded in mobilising his fellow Mbororo so thatthey could play their part in the new political context.Yerima Dairou and the Political Mobilisation of MbororoUpon the restoration of multi-partyism, the Mbororo of the Noun under theleadership of Yerima Dairou, then a member of the Central Committee ofthe UNDP (National Union for Democracy and Progress), were first in-volved in the ranks of this party – the party of their “brother”, Bouba BelloMaigari, a Fulani from the North and former prime minister of Cameroon.Having been able to unite and mobilise the electorate around him, YerimaDairou became the undisputed political leader of the Mbororo in the Nounand even in the West. In the legislative elections of 1992, he led the UNDPlist in the Noun, and the Mbororo voted overwhelmingly for this party.With this allegiance, which combines ethnicity (Fulani) and political coalitionwith the UNDP in a division controlled by the UDC party, the Mbororoface off with the Bamun, most of whom are part of the UDC and the ad-82Ibrahim Mouicheministration allied with the ruling party, the RDPC. One Mbororo informantclaimed that for the Bamun, the Mbororo are only “strangers and enemiesto kill” and thus that it is necessary for the Bamun “to burn down [theMbororo’s] settlements, to destroy their pastures and to expel them fromthe Noun”. As a result, the agro-pastoral conflicts are politicised and some-times result in the deaths of Mbororo men and the destruction of pastures.In some other places, they are simply prohibited access to waterways, theaim being to prevent their use by livestock. The administration, in turn, hasraised the price for pasture access and even threatened to expel the Mbororoto elicit their allegiance to the RDPC.In 1995, the administration was also making use of its cunning. In thehopes of getting Yerima Dairou to return to the ruling party, the admin-istration agreed to appoint him village chief of Didango, a position his fol-lowers believed for quite some time he should have already held. The timingwas not fortuitous. Because as village chief he would become an auxiliary ofthe territorial administration and could not continue to alienate the admin-istration by remaining in the opposition (the UNDP), he had to return to hisprevious benefactor and support the RDPC. Moreover, almost all traditionalleaders in this division are committed to the cause of the RDPC, startingwith the most prominent of them, the sultan of the Bamun. In fact, YerimaDairou henceforth called himself “lamido” (like the Fulani chiefs in North-ern Cameroon) and joined the ruling party. But as the Bamun majority arecommitted to the UDC and fiercely oppose the RDPC, the Mbororo are stillcaught between a rock and a hard place: the UDC and the RDPC.Anxious to protect their interests, of which the most important is ac-cess to pastureland, the Mbororo in Noun organised themselves strategicallybetween allegiance to the UDC and the RDPC. In the 1996 municipal elec-tions, there were Mbororo candidates in the ruling party and the oppositionparty. Seeing as how the UDC enjoy majority support in the Noun, theMbororo had believed that their support of the UDC would benefit them inthe fight against poverty, but that turned out to be an illusion.Confronted with this misfortune, the Mbororo – while keeping a smallreserve of opposition in order to keep on good terms with their farmingBamun neighbours – became a source of votes mainly for the RDPC, theparty they perceived as being more responsive to their needs and require-ments. “The Mbororo support the ruling party because its supporters deal inachievements and not promises,” says one Mbororo interviewee. Accordingto another interviewee, the UDC does not go deep enough in its diagnosisto address the problems of the Mbororo in the Noun; this party is not awareof the specific problems of this community. Yet, according to the sameinterviewee, “There is a Mbororo problem in this terroir.” As for the RDPC,Democratisation and Political Participation of Mbororo83it is popularly associated with the intervention of the state apparatus. “Theadministration opens schools, as they did in Yolo and Mbororo-Koutaba.We have three schools with teachers and at least one headmaster.”11 In thehealth field, the creation of health centres has facilitated access to healthcare. The opposition criticises, opposes and proposes but is powerless to puttheir policies into practice. The same interviewee from above says that “it isbetter to [join] the ruling party, which deals in achievements”. The adminis-trative authority recognises this marriage of convenience between the rulingparty and the Mbororo:The Mbororo vote for the RDPC because in their eyes the regime isseen as a liberator – with the [new] constitution [promoted by theruling party] that recognises their rights as a minority. In addition,they have to safeguard their interests well protected by the regime. [...]When one is carrying a tray of eggs, one doesn’t look for a fight! Theyplay an important part in the economy, which is in their interest tosafeguard.Before his death, it was common to see Yerima Dairou at meetings of theSouth-Central Noun Section of the RDPC in Koutaba at the invitation ofthe elite in the Bamun RDPC. Each time he attended one of these meetings,he took the floor to denounce the UDC and its supporters, using provoca-tive words such as: “In the past, the Bamun said Mbororo were bushmen;now under the banner of the RDPC, we have come out of the bush into thelight. It is the Bamun who today remain in the shadows with the UDC.” Butthe UDC supporters see the Mbororo who support the RDPC as “merce-naries”, whose support stems only out of the hopes of receiving state re-sources (money, food, loincloths, T-shirts, gadgets, etc.). But Yerima Dairoudied in 2004, leaving the Mbororo of Noun Division somewhat orphaned.Admittedly, the Mbororo have bureaucratic elites, but these are not politicalentrepreneurs in the West Region; the political field has been almost com-pletely saturated with their farming neighbours for decades.Routinisation of Voting and the Mbororo’s StrategicPolitical IdentificationFrom the perspective of party identification, Table 2 shows the distributionof votes between the RDPC and the UDC based on ethnic divisions be-tween the Bamun and the Mbororo in the Noun.11Didango benefits from electricity supply, hydraulics and fixed phones with 24 ruralsubscribers today; it will soon offer the Internet, thanks to the work of its manydynamic elites.84Table 2: Distribution of Ethnic Votes in Three Polling Stationsin the Noun, 2007 Municipal ElectionsRegisteredvotersNumber thatvotedRDPCUDCKoumbam II(Mbororosettlement)216947617Bangambi-Somtain(Mbororosettlement)72453510Ibrahim MouicheKoumbam I(Bamun)112591841Source: Commission communale de supervision, The provisional resultsof the municipal elections of 22 July 2007, Archives of the Sub-divisional Office of Bangourain.These polling stations are mono-ethnic; we deliberately chose these becausethis fact could well account for the current sympathy for the two main par-ties held by the Mbororo. Today, with the routinisation of the multi-partysystem, the logic of confrontation has given way to that of adaptation andeven mutual respect between the Mbororo and the Bamun. This extends toall their farming neighbours in the West, even though cultural stereotypes,the lack of leadership, and the educational deficit of the Mbororo continueto marginalise them. The strategic political alignment of previous years hasbeen succeeded by the vote of convenience. Under these circumstances, theruling party has ensured its supremacy in the West. This domination is illus-trated by the existence of specific RDPC cells and certain local committeesin some Mbororo encampments, at least in the Noun, where the low-levelparty structures are numerically important (Didango, Kourom, Yolo,Bagambi). Before 2007, the UDC had a few local committees in two orthree Mbororo encampments in the Noun; now there is only one left (inDidango), which shares structural features with the RDPC. Our Mbororoinformants from Didango have also commented on how multi-partyismcontributed to the splitting up families and clans within the community, withbad blood evolving between supporters of opposing parties.Where representation in the leadership of political parties is concerned,there is no Mbororo in the ruling authorities of the UDC or the SDF,whether at the sub-divisional, divisional or regional level. In the RDPC,(which has no regional representation), one single Mbororo, Mbounje Ada-mou, is a member of the sub-section board in Bagambi in Noun Division.This figure is astoundingly low considering that there are over one thousandparty members in the whole division. At a higher level, in 2002 anotherDemocratisation and Political Participation of Mbororo85Mbororo, Ahmet Abdallah, was elected president of the OJRDPC (theyouth branch of the ruling party) for the south-central section of the Noun,located in Koutaba, beating out a Bamun candidate. Abdallah was re-electedin 2007, this time by acclamation. He also remains the only Mbororo toappear on an executive board of an RDPC section in Noun Division, adivision that has six sections and a total of 18 executive boards at the divi-sion level divided among three branches: adults, women and youth. Onemust also consider that each of the 18 executive boards has at least 17members, so the Mbororo representation is insignificant compared to thatof other ethnic communities, native and non-native, especially the Tikar, theBamileke and the Northwestern nationals, even though the inclusion ofthese groups is based on the ethnic makeup of the districts. However, Ah-met Abdallah represents a qualitative step in the political representation ofthe Mbororo as compared to their representation in the single-party periodwhen they were represented only at the lower levels of inferior governingbodies, the cell and the local committee. Even though the RDPC structuresin the Mbororo encampments are mono-ethnic, this is not the case at thelevel of higher bodies such as the sub-section and the section. In addition tothis, Ahmet Abdallah theoretically runs a multi-ethnic structure, although inreality it is controlled by the Bamun.Determinants of Mbororo Political ParticipationWe will now explore the factors that ensured the socio-political mutation ofthe Western Mbororo. In this regard, three mutually inclusive factors seemto be essential: first, a favourable legal and institutional environment; se-cond, from the perspective of resource mobilisation, MBOSCUDA activism– a new Mbororo social movement established in 1992 that works towardthe socio-political integration of this community; and finally, the structuralassimilation of ethnic groups into political parties.Regarding the first factor, according to the legal-institutional frame-work, the socio-political integration of minorities goes through a number ofinstitutional arrangements. From this perspective, respect for minority rightsrequires special measures that would create prospects for these groups thatthe absolute law of the majority tends to impair; with the principle of “equaltreatment for all”, some minorities always end up in the unfavourable posi-tion of having to defend their interests. This may consist of institutionalengineering in the form of quotas, “affirmative action”, or even specialelectoral divisions (see Safran 1994: 61-80). For example, electoral bounda-ries in the US have often served racial minorities such as African-Americans,enabling them to constitute on their own an electoral majority in one or86Ibrahim Mouichemore constituencies. For this reason, after each US census, the courts mustadjust the layout of districts based on demographic trends that have oc-curred over the past decade. Pascal Noblet sees in this political practice atrue path to “substantive equality” (Noblet 1993: 133).In Cameroon, the political liberalisation of the 1990s culminated in aconstitutional reform on 18 January 1996, which establishes a decentralisedunitary state, recognises indigenous rights, and protects minorities. Thepreamble of the Constitution explicitly states that the state shall ensure theprotection of minorities and shall preserve the rights of indigenous popula-tions. Moreover, in Section X on regional and local authorities, Article 57 (2)provides that the Regional Council, the legislative body of the region, “shallreflect the various sociological components of the region”. Before this con-stitutional reform, legislation on the organisation of municipal and legislativeelections passed in the 1990s had already established the requirement ofrespect for “various sociological components” in the electoral districts: Arti-cle 5 (4) of Law 91/020 of 16 December 1991, which established the condi-tions for the election of MPs to the National Assembly, and Article 3 (2) ofLaw 92/002 of 14 August 1992, which set the conditions for the election ofmunicipal councillors. This notion of “sociological components” essentiallyboils down to “various ethnic components of the population”. This is alsothe meaning that litigants in Cameroon have given it as part of legal actionsrelating to municipal elections since 1996 (see Donfack Sokeng 2001: 30-31).“Democracy”, a term often confused with political liberalisation, “pro-tects minorities, [and tries] to integrate them. If there were no statutory andconstitutional provisions in their favour, no Mbororo at all would be repre-sented in City Hall,” a local authority told us in an interview.12 This senti-ment was confirmed by our informant, a member of the Mbororo politicalelite: “Democracy strengthens the position of minorities, providing a wayout of their disadvantaged positions. It at least offers them the opportunityto express themselves. With multi-partyism, we have some municipal coun-cillors.”13Regarding the second factor (the new Mbororo social movement,MBOSCUDA), we refer to resource mobilisation theory, which “shows theprocess by which a dissatisfied group assembles and invests resources inpursuit of its own goals” (Oberschall 1973: 28). Mobilisation is an instru-mental activity that is put into action once the goals are set – resources beingdefined as the object of this activity. From this perspective, society, as op-1213Interview with Lukonga Hamajouda, 2nd deputy mayor of Jakiri (RDPC), Jakiri 27April 2008.Interview with Hassan Hamadou, a Mbororo and the government district delegatefor cattle breeding, Koutaba District, Koutaba 3 May 2008.Democratisation and Political Participation of Mbororo87posed to the field of action, is defined as the environment providing politicalagents and social movements the necessary resources for action. “Societyprovides the infrastructure used by industries of social movements andother industries” (Zald and McCarthy 1977: 217).In the case we are concerned with, and according to the Mbororothemselves, the MBOSCUDA has done much through its awareness-raisingactivities to further the population’s appropriation of their civil and politicalrights (see Davis 1995: 225 ff.; Pelican 2008: 540-560). Reportedly, theMBOSCUDA was particularly helpful in assisting the Mbororo psychologi-cally. The name “Mbororo” is now accepted and internalised by theMbororo themselves whereas before, the term was a pejorative, a source offrustration, and therefore rejected. The Mbororo previously preferred to becalled Fulani or Fula. The MBOSCUDA also helped to advance educationamong the Mbororo. During the phase of awareness-raising, theMBOSCUDA went everywhere: the hamlets, villages, neighbourhoods, etc.All occasions were good opportunities to revamp Mbororo self-esteem: afestive occasion anywhere, or a meeting in a cattle market – in short, wher-ever the Mbororo could come together. The MBOSCUDA also relied onthe help and networks of the ardos. The MBOSCUDA urged the Mbororo toattend school, to be vaccinated, to apply for the national identity card, toobtain birth and marriage certificates – in short, they were taught their civiland political rights and all that is inherent in human rights. TheMBOSCUDA has also provided the Mbororo with legal assistance. Thisassistance is very salutary; previously when threatened with a lawsuit, aMbororo would be so alarmed that s/he would risk all her/his assets toavoid losing the trial and her/his honour, but now the way of thinking haschanged. The MBOSCUDA also asked them to settle, to modernise stockfarming and to acquire land deeds in order to avoid being at the mercy ofthe other farmers, who sometimes produce deeds issued after the settlementof the Mbororo. The MBOSCUDA provides teaching materials, desks andchairs in Mbororo schools, along with medical equipment and other neces-sary items. Finally, the MBOSCUDA promotes a better recognition of theMbororo, in order that they achieve greater visibility and are able to activelyparticipate in national politics (including by their representation in govern-ment).The MBOSCUDA thus remains confined to an awareness-raising roleand does not formally associate with political parties.14 But by involvingtraditional and administrative authorities (divisional officers and senior divi-14However, the MBOSCUDA is still dominated by bureaucratic elites established inYaoundé, the seat of the institutions. And these elites support the ruling party.88Ibrahim Mouichesional officers) as it does in its meetings, the MBOSCUDA’s presence guar-antees the political integration of the Mbororo. To cite one example, theMbororo are included on the lists of candidates for election – with the helpof the administrative authorities, who have the great responsibility of en-suring the compliance of political parties with the rights of minorities elabo-rated in the Constitution. The MBOSCUDA seems even more active inter-nationally. According to Michaela Pelican,[The] MBOSCUDA has also been instrumental in redefining Mbororonational citizenship. Alongside collaborating with international devel-opment agencies, it has created links with transnational human andminority rights organisations, including Amnesty International, Sur-vival International, Minority Rights Group International, and theWorld Intellectual Property Organization. This international backingproved vital in contesting human rights abuses committed by stateagents against Mbororo individuals.Furthermore, in line with the proclamation of the decade of ‘indige-nous peoples’ (1995–2004) by the United Nations, [the] MBOSCUDApromoted the Mbororo as an “indigenous minority” whose culturalsurvival had to be protected. [...] In 2005 [the] MBOSCUDA wasgranted special consultative status by the Economic and Social Councilof the United Nations (Pelican, 2008: 550-551).As we can see, the perspective of resource mobilisation not only affectspartisan and formal political activity, but also helps us analyse the socialmovements by giving central importance to their organisational structures,the strategic interactions between organisations, and the relationship be-tween organisations or social movements and their environment. It appealsto rationality and argues that participation in a movement must be consid-ered rational behaviour just like any other institutional behaviour. In thisregard, it adopts the opposite point of view to that of the classical model,which considers social movements the effects of failure or malfunction ofthe social system. The view adopted here is, on the contrary, based on thepremise that resource mobilisation with the aim of collective action is prob-lematic and, as such, involves a cost and a benefit for any group wishing toengage in political action (Arcand, 2003: 24).Finally, the third factor is structuralism, seen here in terms of demo-cratic culture within the parties based on Peter M. Leslie’s “structural assim-ilation” – that is, the proportional distribution of ethnic groups in thestructures of (the aforementioned) political parties (Leslie 1969: 422). It is infact the political parties that put into practice the legislative and constitu-tional requirements regarding minority rights and “sociological compo-nents” of electoral districts, giving a few places to Mbororo communityDemocratisation and Political Participation of Mbororo89members in their organisational structures and their lists of candidates dur-ing the nomination phase of elections. In most cases, it is less the integrationof minorities and more the political parties’ electoral interests that prevail,the latter being manifested in electoral votes that they either get or expect toget from the target population. The strategy of “proximity” (Stroh 2010) isobviously central here. On the one hand, the Mbororo are politically apa-thetic as we have outlined above. On the other hand, due to their demo-graphically scattered population, the Mbororo are minorities wherever theyare located in the West and cannot alone influence the outcome of an elec-tion in any locality. From what has been said, the political parties (here theRDPC, SDF, and UDC) seem to be at the vanguard of democratic devel-opment, as they have ensured the political representation of the Mbororodespite the latter’s political apathy and demographic weakness.However, the political parties in the opposition and the one in poweremploy different strategies to win Mbororo votes. We noted during somepolitical meetings in the Noun that on the discursive level, the Mbororo donot side with the criticism against the regime voiced by the opposition,knowing that only the ruling party can find solutions to their most immedi-ate and urgent problems. Taking the case of the Noun, a case that applies tomany other Mbororo localities as well, the Mbororo have over decades ofcohabitation learned the Bamun language, and some Bamun handle Fulaniwith the greatest of ease. In setting up lists of candidates, UDC leaders usu-ally confine themselves to co-opting some Mbororo in their lists throughtheir network of Bamun “beaters”, especially as there is no primary electionfor the nomination of candidates in this party. During the electoral cam-paigns, everything takes place in the village market (Bamun market), anddecisions are made in the Bamun language. Of course, care is taken to invitea Mbororo candidate, to whom of course little attention is paid. Neverthe-less, the UDC does campaign in Didango.Concerning the RDPC, the situation is somewhat variable taking intoaccount the demographic data. Thus, in localities with high Mbororo con-centrations (Bagambi, Didango, Kourom, Yolo, etc.), during electoral cam-paigns (legislative, presidential and municipal), officials from the ruling partygenerally do well by going to the encampments and communicating with theMbororo and their ardos. On such occasions, they no longer speak Bamun,but rather Fulfulde, even if all the Bamun present do not understand thislanguage. Latitude is given to the Mbororo to express themselves, to presenttheir grievances – including their complaints – in the language of theirchoice. In turn, RDPC officials take the opportunity to emphasise the gov-ernment’s protection of minorities, to which the Mbororo belong, as being a90Ibrahim Mouichecornerstone. In areas with low concentrations of Mbororo, it is the samestory as with the UDC: It all takes place in the village market square.The Political Participation of Western Mbororo:A Political Awakening?Unlike in the single-party period, when it was difficult for them even tovote, it is in terms of “political awakening” that the quantum leap made bythe Mbororo in the West must be described in this new context of politicalliberalisation. Nevertheless, this awakening is not unique. Following theexample of the West, the neighbouring Anglophone Northwest is also fullof many Mbororo encampments, and one is struck by some parallels interms of their political participation. Like the West, the Northwest is a re-gion of high plateaus with wet grassland vegetation: ideal pastureland. Thefarmers here also hold an unchallenged demographic and political suprem-acy over the Mbororo. The West and the Northwest combined constitutethe third-largest area for cattle breeding in Cameroon (see Boutrais 1984:225). Upon the restoration of multi-partyism, Northwestern Mbororo sup-ported the UNDP party of Bello Bouba Maigari, though the area was con-trolled by the opposition SDF. The crisis and development that followedwere not unlike those experienced in the same period by the Mbororo inNoun. Only the amplitude of the conflict is different here: The Mbororowere called upon to defend themselves and they also resorted to violenceagainst indigenous farmers, supporters of the SDF, as reported by LucyDavis:During the recent changes in the direction of multi-party politics inCameroon, many of the Northwest Province Mbororo switched alle-giance from their traditional support of Biya’s ruling CPDM party tosupport of the Northern, Muslim politician Bouba Bello, then head ofthe UNDP, the third-largest party. […]During the state of emergency in October 1992, a number ofMbororo compounds were attacked and burnt, large numbers of cat-tle are claimed to have been attacked with machetes. The Mborororetaliated on horseback, attacking local villagers with their herdingstaffs. Mbororo were not permitted to enter certain market towns andhad to buy their provisions through Hausa middlemen. These eventsmay indeed have helped lead the Mbororo into a more genuine,growing movement towards Muslim unity in Northwest Province, al-beit as yet independent from the North (Davis 1995: 221).Democratisation and Political Participation of Mbororo91This tension highlights the ethnic dimension, especially the close relation-ship between a feeling of identity, territorial control and political competi-tion. It raises the fundamental questions of right to the soil, not of a partic-ular individual, but of a group (Pourtier 1998: 139). But, as has been rightlyseen by Jean-François Bayart, Peter Geschiere and Francis Nyamnjoh, thepolitical moment when the assertion of autochthony occurs “undoubtedlyremains that of the democratisation of authoritarian regimes and of author-itarian restoration strategies”, “two quasi-concomitant processes in the1990s, which, however, should not be confused” (Bayart, Geschiere andNyamnjoh 2001: 182-186). But what is remarkable here is that the opposi-tion (the SDF in the Northwest and the UDC in Noun) participates in thesame authoritarian prism, by compelling the Mbororo to enrol in thoseparties. With the routinisation of the electoral process, the Mbororo of theNorthwest became a source of votes for the RDPC as did the Mbororo ofthe West. It is this RDPC–Mbororo alliance that the sub-divisional officerof Jakiri (division of Bui, Northwest) who we interviewed during the fieldsurveys called “republican tradition”.In addition, we have shown above that Mbororo society is not weldedor organised by a centralised political structure but rather built on the basisof small clan units. This in addition to their individualism weakens theirposition as a group capable of mobilising. Against this segmental trend,Yerima Dairou, who was appointed chief of the village of Didango in 1995,attempted to politically unify the Noun Mbororo and even the WesternMbororo – a unification modelled on the Fulani lamidates of NorthernCameroon – and he called himself lamido, thereby the paramount chief ofthe ardos. Even though the undertaking was received favourably in Didango,clan individualism still had too thick a skin among the ardos and theMbororo of other camps for all to acknowledge him. Besides, for such aproject to be truly successful, it would need the concomitant endorsementof the administration and the sultan of Bamum. However, Dairou, as alamido – whose purpose is to rule over all the Mbororo in the Noun – com-petes with that of the sultan of Bamum, which in the socio-political contextof the Bamun kingdom is unacceptable. Yerima Dairou’s father initiallyattempted to get acknowledged by the colonial administration as lamido(1915–1962), but he gave that pursuit up following independence. Amongother reasons, his decision was borne out of consideration, as no-one in thekingdom of Bamun should have a power similar to that of the sultan (seeSalé 1991). In fact, the so-called “lamidate” of Didango confers only thestatus of village chief (third degree), and its sphere of influence is confinedto Didango. Nevertheless, it represents an important reference point in thetraditional local power structure and especially for the inclusion of the92Ibrahim MouicheMbororo. In the Northwest, a similar structure was created in 2001 withvarying degrees of success at Sabga near Bamenda.15Like in Cameroon’s West, multi-partyism and democratisation haveopened new opportunities for the Mbororo of the Northwest. They are,more and more, running for positions as municipal councillors and evenmanaging to win, drawing on the support of the new legal and institutionalarchitecture in favour of minorities that the MBOSCUDA has long workedtoward. It is not unimportant to note that the national president of theMBOSCUDA, El Hadj Jaji Manu Gidado, prince of Sagba, is a native of theNorthwest and a high-ranking official (chargé de mission) at the presidency ofthe republic. It was in this region in 2007 (and nowhere else in Cameroon todate) that the Mbororo began to take decisive steps with regard to theirpolitical integration, by registering one of their own in the municipal execu-tive, the position of third assistant of the mayor in the town of Jakiri, underthe banner of the RDPC. Some Mbororo are also members of the CPDMsections in the region, youth and adult branches; and in Jakiri, the vice-president of the OJRDPC is a Mbororo.From the perspective of “indigenous peoples”, one notes some homol-ogies between the Mbororo and the Pygmies of the forest areas of central,eastern and southern Cameroon. But it is above all the contrasts that prevail.Like the Mbororo, a few Pygmies are now councillors in the municipalitiesof the East and the South even though this was not the case before 2007(see Tchoumba, Guechou Bouopda and Messe 2006; Nke Ndih 2010). Ob-viously, the Pygmies should enjoy the same new legal-institutional frame-work as the Mbororo. But this is unfortunately not the case: Without anyeducational and intellectual background, Pygmies have no social movementfollowing the example of the MBOSCUDA, not to mention leaders or bu-reaucratic elites. Unlike the Mbororo, who have some economic powerthrough cattle breeding, the Pygmies rather remain poor “savages” con-stantly undermined and exploited by their Bantu neighbours. This exploita-tion even borders on slavery and fortunately is constantly denounced byNGOs. It is these NGOs and the state that are now trying to support thePygmies’ participation in several programmes.15See Issa Niania in The Frontier Telegraph – A Bi-Monthly News Publication, Bamenda,September 2007, online: <www.thefrontiertelegraph.com/content/saga_of_the_sabga_lamidad.html> (10 June 2011).Democratisation and Political Participation of Mbororo93ConclusionWe have just seen that, as long as elections within the one-party systemremained a simple ritual to legitimate rulers, those rulers did not need theMbororo; with multi-partyism and democratisation, where balloting changedfrom a ritual vote to the process of actually electing rulers, the Mbororo ofthe West have become political subjects and actors. And from the viciouscircle under the single party, this community is beginning its transition intothe virtuous circle by exercising its political rights, which were in formertimes ignored or denied, and by assuming its citizenship completely as can-didates in the municipal institutions, members of local hierarchies in politicalparties, etc. These are the milestones considered from the qualitative – notthe quantitative – perspective that have led us to the conclusion about theMbororo political awakening. This transformation, comparable to that ofthe Mbororo of the Northwest, is a result of three main factors: first, thenew legal-institutional architecture, which confirms the rights of minoritiesand compels the different protagonists of the electoral process to respectthe “various sociological components” of the electoral constituencies; se-cond, the role of the MBOSCUDA, a new social movement of the Mbororothat works by raising awareness about how the Mbororo can appropriatetheir civil and political rights; and third, the structural assimilation of ethnicgroups by the RDPC, UDC and SDF, which grant certain roles to themembers of this community in the structures of their organisations and theirlists of candidatures during nominations for the municipal elections. Thisstudy highlights the central role of political parties in the social and politicalintegration of ethnic minorities as well as the role of social movements asstrategic activities for the purpose of entry into the political system and asactivities instrumental to the mobilisation of social groups or individuals(Lapeyronnie 1988: 593).It remains a fact, however, that the Mbororo in the West – as in therest of Cameroon – have not yet succeeded in transforming their politicalawakening into real political victory; they have not taken over control oflocal rule by becoming municipal executives in the region. There is only oneMbororo deputy mayor in a country comprised of 360 municipalities andtherefore almost one thousand executive posts – this in addition to a “fewrepresentatives in municipal councils that are there to decorate the galleryand give the impression that they are taken into account” to use FadimatouDahirou’s words. No Mbororo has ever been mayor and as of this momentthe doors of parliament are still closed to the Mbororo, despite the lateYerima Dahirou of Didango having obtained in 1992 for the first time theendorsement as parliamentary candidate of the Noun constituency for theUNDP in the general elections. This experience is slow to repeat itself, and94Ibrahim Mouichetherefore constitutional democracy is still struggling to truly penetrate thepolitical field in Cameroon. That is why among their grievances, theMbororo voice repeatedly that they want to have a member of their com-munity appointed either a minister, or a representative in the National As-sembly. The same would hold true for the senate and regional assemblies –both institutions are stipulated in the constitution but have yet to be created.The Mbororo are also advancing their demands to have local councillorsand mayors, arguing that they have the necessary “qualifications”. Finally,there is no space to discuss the role of the arena (regional or national) forthe strategies and constraints of political participation by groups with acommon sense of belonging. We must also consider the contentious ques-tion of whether all described acts of participation and contestation are in theinterests of the group, or simply boil down to an individual’s ambitions. Thiscontribution has chosen to look at political participation from the perspec-tive of groups with a sense of common origin to provide a counterweight tothe (dominant) contributions that analyse the strategies of political partiesand “big men”; but these perspectives are not necessarily incompatible.References<ref>Arcand, Sébastien (2003), Les minorités ethniques et l’État québécois: participation et</ref>représentations sociales des associations de groupes ethniques minoritaires lors decommissions parlementaires, 1974-2000, thèse de doctorat en sociologie,Département de sociologie Université de Montréal.Barbier, Claude (1981), Les groupes ethniques et les langues, in:<ref>L’Encyclopédie de la République unie du Cameroun, Douala, NEA, 239-260.</ref>Bayart, Jean-François, Peter Geschiere and Francis.

Folgende politische Ver-änderungen hatten positive Auswirkungen für die Mbororo: die neuen ge-setzlichen und institutionellen Rahmenbedingungen aufgrund der Verfas-sungsänderung von 1996, die Folgen des politischen Wettbewerbs innerhalbdes Mehrparteiensystems seit 1990 und die Mobilisierung der Mbororodurch eine nicht parteigebundene Vereinigung zur Förderung ihrer Interes-sen als Ethnie, der 1992 gegründeten MBOSCUDA. Die Kombination die-ser Faktoren führte zu einem politischen Erwachen der Mbororo. Der vor-liegende Beitrag möchte zu einem besseren Verständnis der Bestimmungs-faktoren und der wesentlichen Beteiligten an dieser Entwicklung beitragen.Schlagwörter: Kamerun, Demokratisierung, Politische Partizipation, Min-derheit, Mbororo
