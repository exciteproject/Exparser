No Time to ThinkAcademics’ life in the globally wireduniversityHeather Menzies and Janice NewsonABSTRACT. This article reports on a study of how Canadianacademics use on-line technologies to deal with increasing demandsand time pressures. The results suggest that, in struggling to manageconflicting organizational and temporal priorities, academics areadopting practices to manage these conflicts which adversely affectthe quality and content of their teaching and research. Moreover,these changes in practice are integral to reconstituting the temporaland organizational order of universities so they can function as nodesin the wired global economy. Academics are urged to vigorouslychampion temporal practices which allow time for reflection andthe ‘deep presence’ required for creative intellectual work.

The university is no longer a refuge fromthe hustle-bustle, a slow zone for reading and reflection, critical dialogue andknowledge creation – to the extent that it ever was. Some research we havecarried out not only confirms what others have documented about academics’increasingly stressed state, as Canadian universities have been restructured andhave become nodes in the wired knowledge economy (Kinman and Jones,1998/2004). It also develops the proposition posed by Ylijoki and MantylaTime & Society copyright © 2007 SAGE (London, Los Angeles, New Delhi and Singapore)VOL. 16 No. 1 (2007), pp. 83–98 0961-463X DOI: 10.1177/0961463X07074103www.sagepublications.com84TIME & SOCIETY 16(1)(2003) that the ‘conflicts in temporal perspectives’ (e.g. between ‘scheduledtime’ and ‘time-less’ creative time) ‘are closely linked’ to profound organiza-tional shifts in universities. These shifts have been associated with conceptssuch as ‘value for money’ (Cassin and Morgan, 1992), ‘managerialism’(Newson, 1992), ‘the knowledge industry’ (Polster, 1998), ‘academic capital-ism’ (Slaughter and Leslie, 1997), ‘the new public management,’ and thetransformation of relatively autonomous, self-governing academics into ‘man-aged professionals’ and ‘state-subsidized entrepreneurs’ conforming to the‘fast-zone’ tempo of business and politics (Pels, 2003).Our research not only sheds a light on these linkages and how the changedtemporal and structural order of the university campus is accompanied bysignificant changes in academics’ practices. It shows the impact this is having onthe quality of teaching and research. The research also reveals how academics arethemselves participating in these changes, thus helping to co-produce, throughchanged temporal and organizational practices, a new ‘social in motion’ (Thrift,2004) and a different ‘metaphysics of being’ (Adam, 2005). Yet, having identi-fied their participation and agency, the research also explores the struggle manyacademics seem to be engaged in over the conflicting temporal and organization-al priorities within the wired university environment, and some of the personalinitiatives they are taking in response. We end with some thoughts on negotiatingpersonal, organizational and public policies to support, and even renew, theacademic vocation and the university as an institution of public culture.The research involved a detailed survey of academics’ time and the quality oftheir work life mapped against their use of new information technologies in acontext of significant shifts in universities’ funding arrangements. Follow-upinterviews probed some of the paradoxes and contradictions the survey resultsuncovered – for example, that while most respondents felt better connected,especially nationally and globally, many also felt more isolated; and while con-sidering themselves more productive, many also felt that they were becomingless creative. The research has completed its pilot-project phase, with around 80questionnaires completed and 20 follow-up interviews done. The results are richand compelling enough that we want to give them broad exposure here.The Social-organizational Context: Retrenching, Retro-fitting andRepositioning1Over the past two and a half decades, in response to successive shifts in govern-ment funding policies, Canadian universities have significantly shifted frombeing the public serving, collegially governed, nation-building institutions thatemerged during the post-Second World War period of expansion.2 They havereinvented themselves as institutions more integrated with the global knowledgeMENZIES & NEWSON: NO TIME TO THINK85economy. This reinvention has not happened all at once. It has not only beencumulative. Each layer of adaptation and each new initiative has rested upon andinterwoven with others, with mutually reinforcing effects.The retrenchment layer began around the mid-1970s, as federal and provin-cial levels of government gradually reduced their funding for education, healthand social programmes. At first, universities responded to funding shortfalls asshort-term fiscal crises which had to be handled until things returned to‘normal’. Over time, it became evident that ‘under-funding’ had become thenew reality.As fiscal pressures increased, so too internal tensions were exacerbated. Thetask of controlling and overseeing the budget became a determining feature ofuniversity decision making. Correspondingly, the role and tasks of ‘manage-ment’ began to occupy the institutional centre while the role of collegial govern-ance through academic bodies such as faculty councils and senates becameincreasingly marginalized.3In the early 1980s, a powerful idea began to infuse higher education policythat for universities to survive fiscal retrenchment, they needed to repositionthemselves to secure new sources of funding. Organizations such as the newlyfounded Corporate-Higher Education Forum, the Canadian ManufacturersAssociation and the (now defunct) Science Council of Canada argued thatmutually beneficial partnerships between universities and private sector corpo-rations would rescue universities from their funding woes while enablingCanadian corporations greater access to cutting-edge science to advance theircompetitive position in the globalizing economy. In response, Canadian univer-sities began to orient their programmatic objectives toward the economic andpolitical priorities of external agents who could provide additional, albeitmarginal, sources of funding.Over the course of the 1980s and early 1990s, a range of changes in universi-ties’ institutional practices ‘retro-fitted’ them for their new and expanding rolein promoting economic innovation and competitiveness. On the one hand, theexpanding managerially oriented apparatus of decision making and university–corporate linking arrangements reinforced each other and wove together. Asgovernment funding became less reliable, universities needed to exist withinnew and constantly fluctuating budgetary configurations. For this, universitiesdeveloped an extensive tool-kit of performance-based measures and systemsfor monitoring and supervising the activities of academics individually andcollectively. Cost-efficiency, productivity and accountability to real or putativeexternal paymasters in terms of quantifiable, business-like ‘deliverables’became the predominant criteria for assessing and making decisions about‘worthwhile’ expenditures of money, time and energy. On the other hand,universities needed to develop tools for attracting and managing contractualpartnerships with corporate clients. For this, mission statements, strategic plans,86TIME & SOCIETY 16(1)and advertising campaigns became the institutional instruments for shaping andrepresenting their research and teaching priorities as attuned to the needs andobjectives of these potential funders. By the mid-1990s, universities had madethe necessary cultural shifts and developed the institutional capacity to functionas more permeable, multi-purpose, and networked knowledge businesses.4Since 1996, the federal government has infused a massive jolt of research fund-ing through the Canada Foundation for Innovation and the Canada ResearchChairs programmes – $4.5 billion – into these newly emerging ‘knowledgebusinesses’ in ways that push them further down a market-focused path.5 Three-quarters of this funding must secure 60 per cent matched funding from researchpartners who, more often than not, are private sector corporations. Added to this,in 2002 the presidents of Canada’s universities signed an agreement with govern-ment committing their universities and researchers to doubling their researchproductivity and tripling their commercialization performance by 2010.Finally, the substantial restructuring that has occurred in Canadian universi-ties since the 1980s has been significantly enabled by information and commu-nications technologies (ICTs). These have been a key element in ‘retro-fitting’universities to function as externally guided, strategically minded, production-driven knowledge businesses. As our research confirms, these technologiesrange from specific tools, such as instructional software, listservs and chat-discussion groups for students, to an Internet-connected networked environmentallowing global collaboration among academics and new non-academic part-ners, web-based teaching and administration and comprehensive data collectionto serve both on-campus and off-campus reporting requirements. It is not sur-prising that the increasingly networked, boundary-crossing university would sorapidly embrace these technologies as essential ‘tools of the trade’ for doingacademic work. It also makes sense that, in keeping with prevailing policyrhetoric, many advocates of technology-mediated teaching, global connectivityand ‘the wired campus’ have promoted the turn to technology, not only as the‘cutting edge’ of higher education in a fast-paced globalizing world but alsoas an efficient way of responding to the many opportunities and demands thatconfront universities and their faculty.The FindingsOur research not only confirmed academics’ widespread use of the ICTs ineverything from research, preparing and teaching classes, to administration(largely self-serve now since the cutbacks in support staff) and communicatingwith students, friends and colleagues locally and internationally.6 Academicsseem to have adapted to the medium to the point that it is fast becoming a com-fort zone, though fraught with anxiety and contradictions.MENZIES & NEWSON: NO TIME TO THINK87Clearly, they like many things about the new university environment. It’sincreasing the exposure of their work, especially to national and internationalcolleagues (nearly 60% reported this, the women more so than men). It’sincreased their collaborative projects not just a little but a lot.7 They also feel thatit’s made them more productive (55% of women and 42% of men reported this).And it’s increased their connections with students, colleagues and friends, seem-ingly without jeopardizing their sense of being in touch with them; althoughthere’s ambivalence here and even a hint of contradiction. It’s also increasedtheir sense of being part of university decision making, though just as many indi-cated that this had decreased. On the other hand, 51 per cent said that it had notallowed them to have more control over their work schedule. Sixty per cent(71% of the women, 50% of men) feel that it’s increased expectations of whatthey can accomplish. Nearly 40 per cent (45% of the women, 31% of men)reported feeling overwhelmed by the plethora of opportunities to which the newenvironment exposed them. And 43 per cent (40% of women, 47% of men)reported that it uses up their time solving technological problems.It is clear, then, that there are many things academics do not like about thenew environment. In the most decisive response in the questionnaire, 69 per centsaid that they do not thrive on the time pressures and fast pace of it (56% ofwomen indicated this, compared to 81% of the men). Not surprisingly, therespondents reported many of the most common symptoms of stress, from sleepdeprivation (53% of women, compared to 42% of men) to new allergies or foodsensitivities (26% of women, compared to 6% of men), short-term memory loss(45% of women compared to 25% of men) and problems concentrating (37% ofwomen compared to 19% of men). Interestingly, while the women also reportedmore stress in personal relationships, from strained relations with family (26%compared to 11% of men) to strained relations with colleagues (34% of womencompared to 19% of men), the men reported far more incidents of road rage andits variants (22% of men, versus 5% of women).Stress is an important personal and public-health issue in itself, and deservesurgent attention. However, echoing others’ speculations, we see it here as asymptom of some fundamental contradictions involved in the pursuit of effi-ciency through time compression (Sabelis, 2002). In particular, we explore thisthrough two related themes: first, academics’ ability to be present with them-selves and others and, second, their ability to be socially and intellectuallyengaged in a way that will yield original knowledge, rather than a higher publi-cation rate.Presence and engagementA number of contradictory findings led us to focus on this aspect of academics’existence. For example, despite reporting enhanced connectivity and collabora-88TIME & SOCIETY 16(1)tion with others, 34 per cent of our respondents reported feeling isolated (40%of women compared to 22% of men). We specifically asked whether they ‘areable to stay centred in yourself, to know what matters to you’ in a wiredenvironment where they are increasingly accountable to multiple outside andcorporate-linked actors and subject to their demands and pressures. The resultswere equivocal. Thirty-four per cent said that this ability had decreased, 29 percent felt it had increased and 37 per cent said it hadn’t changed. On the otherhand, a startling 65 per cent reported that their ability to follow through on infor-mal, personal/professional commitments (possibly off line and off campus in thecommunity) had decreased. As well, 57 per cent said that they felt like they were‘reacting, not acting on my own initiative’ on occasion, and another 19 per centsaid they felt this way frequently. Forty-five per cent reported feeling anxiousabout keeping up with work demands and expectations frequently, and another12 per cent reported feeling this way chronically. In a similar vein, 47 per centfeel as though they’re fighting to keep control on occasion and another 20 percent feel that way frequently. Moreover, 58 per cent reported that their abilityto stay focused on their work had decreased, and 42 per cent reported that theirsusceptibility to being distracted by all the information and communicationcoming at them had increased.These findings suggest a significant degree of ‘temporal alienation,’ whichRonald Purser (2002) defines as a ‘loss of situated presence in time’ (p. 163),and which we interpret here to mean presence with others and to one’s self.A professor of organizational behaviour at one university reported having‘fewer and fewer coffees with colleagues who are right in the building and . . .[now] more short conversations with people I would never have contactedbefore. So I’m trading one for the other.’ ‘Quantity for quality?’ she was asked.‘Yes’, she said. ‘It is very superficial and there is no real depth of communica-tion, but if it weren’t for that there would be none.’ She went on to say thatshe’s losing her political consciousness because ‘there’s no one to push me anddevelop me . . . and say, that’s good as far as it goes, and have you thought about. . .?’ As a result, she said, ‘I have less confidence in my own analysis . . . It’salmost back to those pre-consciousness days. We are living in that isolation andnot having any validation.’A professor of English at another university misses the long, late-night phonecalls she used to have with close colleagues and friends now that everyone hasanswering machines and communicates through email: ‘there’s the absence ofvoice and all of the lateral thinking that goes on when you actually have a realconversation, instead of just a focused interchange . . . the actual isolation frompeople in a local community has increased enormously’.A professor of occupational therapy at yet another university echoed thistheme: ‘I feel very connected to people I don’t expect to see. But what I do findis that people I expect to see, like my colleagues who are in the same building, IMENZIES & NEWSON: NO TIME TO THINK89may not see.’ When she does see them is at meetings. But then, ‘I find I’m often,now, lately quiet in meetings, when I’m not by nature quiet. And I think part ofit is because I’m now with people who I only see at meetings! And so, it’s likemeeting quasi-strangers . . .’A professor of social work at the same university worried that as she andothers become habituated to email communication, a more superficial level ofsocial engagement can become the cultural norm: ‘It is a stilted dialogue.’ Shewas asked, ‘does it move you away from spontaneity?’. ‘Yes, and that’s not all.Sometimes we think with our mouths. But on the other hand, we’re so pressuredto give a response that we type up something and send it out because of thepressure for a response, so that doesn’t improve it.’Elsewhere, a professor of film studies lamented that this pressure serves asan alibi for non-presence: ‘It is easier if everyone is anonymous. It makes iteasier to refuse social interaction. It makes it easier to turn people into thingsand to just not be creating a humanistic environment.’ This has particularlyacute implications for women, she thinks. ‘We women have always beenthe embodied subject and technology seems to be erasing our presence in theworld . . . That’s how we exist – as an embodied subject. And I feel technologyis just damaging our sense of authenticity that way – authentic subjects whointeract.’A professor of engineering at yet another university likes how the ‘log-onclassroom’ allows shy students to at least start opening up. However, he alsoquickly invites students to his office once they’ve broached something substan-tial: ‘With email, you can’t read the person’s mode of thinking. So I say, let’shave an appointment.’ Face to face, he continued, ‘I can see if they are com-municating with me, if they understand what I am saying, if the point is gettingacross, if the problem or issue is worth elaborating more. I can’t see that throughemail.’ Finally, he added, his racial and ethnic-minority status makes him sensi-tive to being misunderstood. He feels free to be more fully himself when he’sface to face, likes the freedom of being more spontaneous, he said.A professor of political science who tele-conferenced into committee meet-ings for the years he was on a satellite campus ended up feeling that his partici-pation was largely a sham. He was staying ‘briefed’ he said, but not engagedmeaningfully in decision making. As colleagues told him when he returned tothe main campus, ‘you weren’t here; you weren’t around’.The themes of elided presence and of perceived loss of spontaneous, sus-tained dialogue with people to whom you can be real warrant further study anddiscussion in themselves. They also bear watching for what they predict about apossible shift in academics’ sense of themselves and their work, a theme wehave framed as a possible shift from knowledge creation to knowledge pro-duction, more narrowly focused on gathering data, processing information andpackaging it as knowledge, with more business-like, instrumental action crowd-90TIME & SOCIETY 16(1)ing out the time and pace that the mental and social habits of reflection andcritical dialogue require.Knowledge creation, or production?Academics’ ability to stay focused and their susceptibility to being distracted,discussed earlier, clearly affect the ability to think critically and create originalknowledge. The survey also included questions probing intellectual engage-ment. For example, an overwhelming majority (65% of both men and women)reported that they are not reading as deeply and reflectively as they used to or asthey want to. Nor are they reading as broadly and inter-disciplinarily as theyused to or as they’d like to. Instead, they are scanning, mining sources for selec-tive bits of information. (‘I am reading for specific information . . .’). In responseto suggestive statements such as ‘I don’t have enough free chunks of time inwhich to think’, 51 per cent indicated that they did not, reinforcing one of thesignificant findings of an Icelandic study of academics, which documented aloss of what they called ‘timeless time’ for research and reflection (Ylijoke andMantyla, 2003). As well, a significant minority (28%) identified with the phrase,‘I can’t slow down enough to be in touch with myself and my innermostthoughts’ and, in the same proportion, the statement ‘Everybody I know is toobusy to just talk’. As a kind of summing up, they were asked to consider MarcelProust’s lament for a quality of being in time that allowed for deep memoryassociation. Forty-one per cent said that their capacity for this level of origi-nal/creative thinking had decreased, and fifteen per cent, that it had increased.Overall, we think that the findings on this theme reinforce Ida Sabelis’s(2002) concerns about time compression: not just what gets left out, includingthe time for reflection and dialogue, but also how difficult it is to decompress,thus decreasing what she considers to be the most important aspect of commu-nication: ‘the expression and exchange of meaning’ (p. 93). The interview com-ments flesh out these concerns, and their implications for the future of learningand knowledge creation.A professor of English described sitting at her computer with several win-dows open at once and simultaneously having new emails signalling on herscreen: ‘So you have all these things going on, and in my mind it is almost theperfect match for attention deficit disorder . . . By the time you are a couple ofhours into your email you have lost it. You’re skimming, fragmenting . . .Yourlife is so fragmented. All these emails are coming – “get back to me before mymeeting”.’The professor of occupational therapy quoted earlier described having beeninvolved in an international book project that was three years behind schedule:‘We tried to do a lot of it by email, and sending our chapters to each other andtalking about it, but we didn’t put real fire into this book until I went over toMENZIES & NEWSON: NO TIME TO THINK91Australia for six weeks. So it’s a really interesting illustration, because emailmade it possible for us to work together, but somehow it didn’t help us to get thework done.’A professor of mathematics and statistics at yet another university com-mented on how the fast-paced productivity push toward getting the next grant;publishing the next paper drives out the time for creating a social space-time ofshared learning and knowing:We are becoming loners . . . We are creating in our offices . . . because we havemore access to information and we have tools to do things faster, but we are notsharing with other people to become more sociable. That is the contradiction . . .For example, it used to be they had a weekly seminar and every professor wouldcome and show what they were doing. Everyone commented. This has stopped.There are no weekly seminars anymore because people have said that they don’thave time . . . [But now, she finds] The big questions aren’t being asked anymore.I feel that we are giving students the wrong idea about what learning is. I thinkthe students are now coming to believe it’s just reading a lot, being familiar with alot of information, trying to get information somehow. We are not teaching themto use that information, to process it and then to create something. I think that inthis sense, that is what they call passivity. If they are passive, they don’t create.A biology professor at another university echoed this concern, worrying at howmuch both how teachers teach and how students do their work has devolved into‘modules’ that students alternately ingest or cut and paste into assignments. ‘Butlearning isn’t about the details of what you are learning, I think. It is morefundamental . . . The important point ultimately is just to get the students tothink. It doesn’t matter, it could be biology. Thinking about how biology worksas opposed to knowing little bits about biology.’The professor of engineering quoted earlier talked about how important face-to-face dialogue is to convey to students that one is always creating knowledgeafresh, not just replicating it prescriptively. For example, he said, ‘how to dealwith a design problem on line. In many ways it is trial and error. Even definingthe problem, it isn’t really an absolute. We say the structure could be very rigidor very flexible. We can solve the problem this way, or this way. You know whatI mean? . . . The problem is open-ended. If it is closed, innovation is meaning-less.’Interpreting the findings through the lens of temporalityClearly, the changes affecting universities through the combined effects ofretrenching, repositioning plus retro-fitting have included a radical change intemporality. From the evidence of the survey and the follow-up interviews, thischange, while linked to the organizational structures and related routines ofuniversities, has resonated through the routines and rhythms of academics’ daily92TIME & SOCIETY 16(1)life. To grasp its importance, particularly with a view to developing an agendafor research and policy action, it’s useful to identify some of the particular waysin which this cultural transformation is manifest, for instance through temporalframeworks, through temporal-social practices and through the shaping powerof temporal rhythms.Dick Pels (2003) provides a useful overview of the shifting temporal coordi-nates on which universities now run. In what he calls the ‘social triangle’ ofdiscourse in the public sphere, he locates the university in the ‘culture/science’node (p. 21). He argues that its reputedly tempered pace traditionally had amitigating influence on the otherwise faster time frames and pace associatedwith business and the market economy, occupying the second apex of histriangle, and on politics/the state, occupying the third. Now, however, the macroinfluences of globalization and the ‘fast’ subject positions of the new economy(Thrift, 2000b: 674) combined with ‘the imperatives of academic entrepreneur-ship and self-generated funding’ – features of a repositioned and retro-fittedacademia – are breaking universities out of their own largely autonomoustemporal framework, and integrating them with the faster and more present-minded ones associated with business and politics. As our research documented,this is clearly happening, with ICT networks and their users playing a decisivelyenabling role. Moreover, academics are adapting to the shorter time lines andnew ‘infrastructural routines’ associated with the wired campus, often willinglyand for their own self-interest.Our research also sheds light on the changing temporal practices associatedwith the networked, on-line campus. Not only is time compressed. It is frag-mented and then recombined as many-layered moments through multi-tasking.As discussed, this has consequences, ranging from the suppression of time-consuming activities like reflection and memory (Sabelis, 2002) to temporalalienation. While Purser (2002) links this explicitly to a shifting temporality,arguing that the loss of presence happens as people ‘embody’ and ‘obey’ themechanical or digital rhythms of clock time, Nigel Thrift (2004) perceptivelyadds a layer of useful complexity by discussing how temporal practices arediffused more broadly through organizational innovations like productivitymeasures and the application of logistical reasoning to expediting the flow ofgoods and information.Instrumental rationality, of which logistical reasoning is a variation, essen-tially ‘takes the world largely as given and attempts to find means of living evermore productively and efficiently in it’ (Hassan, 2003: 229). It’s thinkingfocused on the how of things rather than the why. It trades in data (givens) overthe more experience-based stuff of interpretation. While historical critiques ofinstrumentalism, associated with the Frankfurt School for example, didn’tspeculate about the role of time (Hassan, 2003), we would argue that it runs onclock time: not only an externally determined and regulated time, and a time ofMENZIES & NEWSON: NO TIME TO THINK93isolated moments, of instrumental observation, of data analysis and so on, but atime that can be optimized by standardized processes and speed-up, driven byothers. Its service to business and industry has been one of the hallmarks ofcapitalism, epitomized in the phrase ‘time is money’. As it was then, in the daysof factory-like rational bureaucracies, so it likely will be now as global digitalnetworks embody instrumental reason in their systems and software, and extendthe efficiencies of particular managerially oriented innovations throughoutpublic life. ‘Results’ and ‘expected outcomes’ are achieved more quickly.Performance and delivery are made faster, no matter what the ‘deliverables’might be, be they student job placements or time-sensitive research reports.Our research yielded shifts in thinking, from interpretation toward instru-mental productivity. Our academic respondents have shifted a lot of their focusto self-serve administration, fund raising, report writing and technology problemsolving, and their social interactions have shifted from spontaneous conversa-tions with local well-known colleagues to brief, focused, task-specific exchangeswith many near-strangers.If instrumental reasoning is the grammar of a new temporal systems order, thebits and bytes of digital communication are its language. The relevant point hereis that it is a language of standardized abstractions delinked from the particularsof place and people, their embodied experience, stories and memories. Andwhile it still takes time for people to key this language onto the screen, or clickand drag it from one file to another, the abstract immateriality of the mediummeans that its scope for embodied presence is minimal and its capacity to invokethe rhythms of dialogue, nil. Partly, this is due to another temporal aspect of thewired university environment, namely that communication is instant.This is the novelty of ‘real time’, making digital networks hyper-efficientfrom an instrumental point of view but potentially dangerous from a human andcultural point of view. As Ronald Purser (2002) argues, in its deft collapse ofaction and reaction through simultaneity, the real time on which digital networksoperate models a reality characterized by Hannah Arendt as the ‘means-endsparadigm’ (p. 156). This view of what’s real is focused entirely on bringingabout the desired result. Purser argues that time of any duration longer than aninstant is immaterial, an obstacle to be removed. Yet the effect of this – what oneinterview subject referred to simply as ‘the pressure to respond’ – is for peopleto ‘fall back on learned routines and unconscious cognitive biases’, in short to‘perform’. In Thrift’s (2000b) characterization of life in the globalized neweconomy, where everything is a ‘blur of change’, a permanent state of ‘emer-gency bordering on chaos’ and every advantage ‘temporary’, the watchword is‘performability’. This means, as the word suggests, performance to script andspecifications, delivering on prescribed deliverables and maximizing whateveradvantage is available now, now, now. For academics, this implies gettinggrants, producing knowledge, and accumulating publications, patents and other94TIME & SOCIETY 16(1)results – not necessarily authentic original knowledge, oriented to the publicgood.Moreover, this performabilty dynamic can be habit forming, and can funda-mentally shape the consciousness, or habitus,8 of all participants, including aca-demics. For example, nearly 30 per cent of our respondents affirmed, ‘I can’tslow down enough to be in touch with my innermost thoughts’, displayingSabelis’s concerns about the inability of chronically time-compressed people todecompress and, as Pels (2003) recommends, to generally ‘decelerate’ or‘unhasten’. Academics, like others ‘repositioned’ as actors in a globally net-worked world, can ‘become entrained to the rhythms of the dominant economicorder’ (Purser, 2002: 157) and its quick-click, real-time beat.It’s true to the point of being a truism that we are all rooted in the ‘rhythmic-ity of the cosmos, the seasons and the times of the body’ (Sabelis, 2002: 11).Nonetheless, rhythms based on social convention have so eclipsed naturalrhythms, particularly in the ‘socially integrative role’ which rhythms play, thatmany primal rhythms are residual to the point of being vestigial. Moreover, asthe staccato, now-this, now-this beat of real time augments the metronomic,externally regulated beat of regulated and scheduled time and permeates thesocial environment, there is a danger that the sense of rootedness in anythingembodied and physical will become that much weaker. Accordingly, the socialhabits, the temporal practices and social rhythms associated with embodiedreflection, memory and dialogue may wither as well.The academics we interviewed are wise, therefore, to ask what kind of tem-poral and cultural practices they’re modelling to their students as they practisethe processing of information rather than its interpretation through dialogue, andperformance-to-specifications ways of thinking rather than open-ended innova-tion. As Helga Nowotny (1994) notes, ‘new knowledge arises under changedconditions of creation and in changed structures of organization’ (p. 87).The English professor quoted earlier commented on the cost-efficient shiftfrom face-to-face seminar discussions to electronic chat groups at her centre-of-excellence university:I worry about the computer and the screen and the absence of embodiment, [and]that the people who are going to make it through the system and arrive at decision-making places are people who have an absolute disdain for the human condition –for the human body! Does one want people in policy making, making decisionsabout one’s health . . . who are so immune to, or who need so little inter-humanaction?A professor of biology makes a point of keeping his office and lab doors open,and frequenting the public spaces across the campus: ‘I think the students needto see you as a real person, someone who is in a lab or coffee room or in the halls. . . Students need to realize that academia is a part of society. It is part of whatour lives are about,’ he said. In short, it seems that he’s modelling what BarbaraMENZIES & NEWSON: NO TIME TO THINK95Adam (1995) calls being ‘an implicated participant’ in the world (p. 141). Inturn, by getting students talking, and having some continuity with them fromone course to another, he says, they get ‘a sense that they matter . . . By [my]being interested in what they have to say, being interested in their ideas, they askquestions, even if they are afraid they are what they call “stupid questions”.’The professor of engineering at the same university quoted earlier also takestime to meet and talk with students. He does this to model being open-ended inone’s thinking as an engineer. ‘Doubt,’ he said, ‘you can’t make that electronic.’A professor of film studies at the University of Regina talked about the impor-tance of modelling speaking with one’s own particular voice as a way of encour-aging students to find their own. ‘The way the new generation goes about doingresearch, with absolutely no depth,’ she said. ‘The kind of things they willsearch out on the internet – switching from this to that. But there’s just no depthto their sense of what you do with all this material. How do you focus?’ Andso she tells students to come see her, where she helps them find that focus bygetting them talking and, by listening to them stumbling to express themselves,helping them realize that ‘what you have to say is important’.Conclusion: Implications for Research and PolicyPerhaps the biggest lesson to be drawn from our analysis of the changed tempo-rality of academics and their work is the importance of time to understanding/analysing organizational and social change. Not only is the body a ‘bio-politicalterrain’ (Thrift 2000a: 46), but so also are organizations like universities, and thesocial environment in general, including the one in which research and policydebates take place. They are landscapes and timescapes rooted in bodies thatremember and experience life through all their senses.A second lesson is that the medium is the message. If the goal of the univer-sity in a democratic society is to affirm the importance of critical thinking, dia-logue and original knowledge creation in academics and their students, thenthe debate about the changes in universities and academic work which wehave described, and decision making on appropriate policy responses, must bebroadly, democratically participatory, with all that this implies in temporalterms. As the interview comments suggest, academics who had chosen or gonealong with on-line communication for practically everything are now choosingto set limits and, in returning to sustained face-to-face communication in, forexample, brainstorming with students, are rediscovering the benefits of thatattuned in-depth engagement. We might anticipate, therefore, that in an inclu-sive debate about the changing university environment, as academics andadministrators take the time for face-to-face dialogue, they might more vigor-ously champion measures to uphold these temporal practices in organizational96TIME & SOCIETY 16(1)policy. Equally, as academics, personally and collectively, take the necessarysteps to restore presence deep enough for reflective dialogue, they might dis-cover a refreshed originality in their own work, which would inspire morepeople to read and talk about it.Notes1. An expanded discussion of this material can be found in Newson (2005, 1998).2. In the 1950s and 1960s, federal and provincial governments in Canada committedincreasing levels of funding to expanding existing and new universities to serve twoprimary objectives: developing a highly skilled labour force to aid Canada’s economicdevelopment and educating citizens to fulfil their democratic role in society.3. George Keller’s book, Academic Strategy (1984), was an influential interventionduring this period, advocating a shift in universities from ‘administration’ to ‘man-agement’. Keller described the advantages of ‘management’ as being more assertive,fast acting, strategically oriented and externally focused than traditional universityadministration which took direction from the internal considerations and priorities ofcollegial bodies.4. Claire Polster (University of Regina) coined this term.5. Claire Polster (2002) has written the definitive analysis of the CFI and CRC pro-grammes and their implications for Canadian higher education.6. And again, using individual tools such as email and listservs, web-based searches andcourse postings, but habitual use of the Internet-connected wired university environ-ment for daily administrative routines to collaborative research and other projects withacademic and non-academic partners around the country and around the world.7. Here as elsewhere, there was a significant gender difference, with 37 per cent ofwomen reporting ‘a lot’ compared to 22 per cent of the men. Generally, women’sresponses showed some of the most dramatic extremes, both embracing new benefitsthrough ICTs and sensing the contradictions more acutely. See Menzies and Newson(2005) for a more extensive gender analysis.8. Drawing on both Bourdieu’s original coining of the concept and ChristopherGosden’s (1979) modification of it, we consider habitus to be a fluid habitat forthe mind and consciousness, a sort of ‘sedimentation of past practice in the humanorganism so that it unconsciously guides future practice’ (Gosden, 1979: 117).References<ref>Adam, B.
