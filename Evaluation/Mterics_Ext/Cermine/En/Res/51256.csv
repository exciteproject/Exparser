P. 22—34.DemographyThe relevance of the study lies in the acu-te need to modernise the tools for a moreaccurate and comparable reflection of the de-mographic reality of spatial objects of diffe-rent scales. This article aims to test the me-thods of “demographic rankings” developedby Yermakov and Shmakov. The method isbased on the principles of indirect standardi-sation of the major demographic coefficientsrelative to the age structure.The article describes the first attempt toapply the method to the analysis of birth andmortality rates in 1995 and 2010 for 140countries against the global average, and forthe Baltic Sea states against the Europeanaverage. The grouping of countries and theanalysis of changes over the given periodconfirmed a number of demographic develop-ment trends and the persistence of wide terri-torial disparities in major indicators. Theauthors identify opposite trends in rankingbased on the standardised birth (country con-solidation at the level of averaged values)and mortality (polarisation) rates. The featuresof demographic process development in theBaltic regions states are described against theglobal and European background.The study confirmed the validity of thedemographic ranking method, which can beinstrumental in solving not only scientific butalso practical tasks, including those in thefield of demographic and social policy.Key words: demographic ranking, stan-dardised coefficients, countries of the world,Baltic regionIntroductionDemographic development of count-ries and regions of contemporary world ishugely inconsistent. This can be explai-ned by the increasing globalisation anddemocratisation of international exchan-ge of human and intellectual resources,on the one hand, and by the aspiration topreserve the independence of elites andensure the reproduction of the “nation”,D. Ivanov, N. Slukaon the other hand. The inconsistencies are further aggravated by such globaltrends as population ageing, declining birth rate, transformation of familytraditions, and a general decline in the natural increase rate. These circum-stances emphasise the need for an accurate, timely, and comprehensive as-sessment of the demographic situation in certain countries and regions of theworld and possible trends in its short-term development and long-term fore-casting. At the same time, traditional demographic indicators do not alwaysmeet the objective of reflecting global, regional, and country-specific demo-graphic processes. Traditional demographic rates (for instance, birth and mor-tality rates) — although not influenced by the absolute population size — areaffected by numerous structural factors, including the sex structure, ur-ban/rural population structure, marriage structure, etc. However, one of thekey factors affecting the development trends and the level of other demogra-phic rates is the age structure of population [1; 5—7].Age Structure in Demographic AssessmentThe significance of age structure for the demographic situation can bedemonstrated through a comparison of countries that differ considerably inthe level of socioeconomic development, for instance, Poland and Sweden.In 2010, according to the UN, the former had a mortality rate of 9.8 ‰, thelatter of 10.2 ‰. These rates seem to be comparable. However, the paradoxis that the age specific mortality rates are greater in Poland then in Swedenalmost in all age groups (see table 1). The reason behind it is the methodo-logy of calculating the mortality rate that uses total population as its deno-minator. However, it is not homogenous, in particular, in terms of the agestructure; and different age groups show different mortality rates. Populationaged 0—14 accounted for 14.8 % in Poland and 15 % in Sweden, that aged15—64—71.7 and 65.5 % respectively, that above 65—13.5 and 19.5 % res-pectively [12]. In other words, the age structure of population has a major ef-fect on the mortality rate, which does not give a comprehensive picture ofthe qualitative estimation of mortality.Age-specific Mortality Rates in Poland and Sweden, 2010Age group0—45—910—1415—1920—2425—2930—3435—3940—4445—4950—54Poland0.0070.0010.0010.0020.0030.0040.0050.0080.0150.0270.037Sweden0.0030.0000.0010.0010.0020.0020.0030.0030.0050.0080.015Table 123Age group55—5960—6465—6970—7475—79Poland0.0480.0620.1150.1660.253DemographyEnd of table 1Sweden0.0250.0350.0550.0980.182Source: calculated using the data from [11].Standardisation of Demographic Rates and Demographic ForecastingMethods that make it possible to mitigate the distortion caused by stru-ctural factors, first of all, the age structure, have already been developed.One of the ways to navigate around the problem is to use specific rates thatare slightly or not at all affected by structural factors. The other way is tostandardize demographic coefficients. Such standardization is usually basedon factoring overall rates. These factors reflect, on the one hand, the in-tensity (level) of the demographic process and, on the other hand, the size orpercentage of the given subpopulation in total population [1]. The essence ofstandardisation is that the actual overall rates are compared against the in-dicators describing a certain conditional population (real or artificially crea-ted), whose demographic process intensity or structure is used as a bench-mark. The efficiency of chosen methods — direct, indirect or reverse stan-dardisation — depends on what is taken as a benchmark.For the purpose of this study, we will turn to indirect standardisation,which has been widely used for analysing the mortality and — more recently —birth rate. Statistically, it is based on the age structures of real population asthe benchmark, as well as the age-specific indicators of the demographicprocess intensity in standard population. In other words, the age-specific ra-tes are re-weighted against the age structure of the real population. As a re-sult, it was possible to project a number of events that would take place instandard population if its age structure were identical to that of realpopulation. The correlation between the number of demographic events inreal population with and the expected number is expressed by the indirectstandardisation index. The product of the overall standard rate and the indexis the standardised overall rate, which expresses the probable level of theoverall rate in real population given the age-specific intensity of demogra-phic processes is similar to those in standard population. It is expressed bythe following formula: Р1х  m1xIind  х Рх1  mx0 ,х(1)24D. Ivanov, N. Slukawhere Iind is the indirect standardisation index; Р1х the age structure of rela-tion population expressed in absolute terms; m1x is the age specific indicatorsof the demographic process in standard population; mx0 the age-specific indi-cators of the demographic process in the given population.When using standardised rates, one should not forget that they do nothave an independent value, because they depend on the chosen benchmark.Therefore, application of standardised coefficients and corresponding ratesand rankings is limited to comparing different populations under the con-dition that the standardisation was conducted using the same method andbenchmark. At the same time, the benchmark should be a population “samp-le”, whose demographic (first of all, age) structure is close, although not si-milar, to the age structures of the compared populations.This work presents the first attempt to develop a ranking [2—4; 8; 9] ba-sed on the standardised correlation of the birth and mortality rate for almost140 countries against the global average and for the Baltic region against theEuropean average. The study uses the official UN data and the resources ofthe World Bank as of 1995 and 2010 [10—12]. The general formula for cal-culating the average birth rate (standardised birth rate correlation — SBRC)is as follows [2; 8]:SBRCk = SUMk/Σi (AIBi · POPki),(2)where k is the number of a country, i the number of an age group, SBRCk thevalue of standardised birth rate correlation for the kth territory; SUMk is thetotal annual number of births on the kth territory; AIBi the age-specific inci-dence (age-specific birth rate in women of the ith age group), POPki the ave-rage annual size of the ith age group of female population for the kth country.The numerator in formula (2) is the actual annual number of births in thekth country, whereas the denominator is the hypothetical number of births inthe kth country if the age-specific birth rates in women of different ages onthis territory equal the corresponding indicator for a population of a higherlevel.Similarly, one can calculate the standard mortality rate correlation(SMRCk) — a ratio of the number of deaths in the kth country to the hypo-thetical number of deaths under the conditions that the age specific mortalityrates in the country coincide with the global age-specific mortality rates [9].The formula is as follows:SMRCk = DEk/Σi (AIDi · PPki).In other words, it is a comparison of the same process that is taking placewithin two populations — the real and hypothetical ones. The hypotheticalpopulation is the real population of a country characterised by the globalaverage mortality rate. The ratio of the actual (DEk) to the hypothetical num-ber of deaths in the kth country is such as if the mortality rate in each agegroup i were at the global average: Σi (AIDi × × PPki). In the denominator offormula (3), AIDi is the age-specific global incidence (per 1,000 population)in the ith age group; PPki is the average annual size of the ith age group in thekth country. Therefore the denominator totals the results for each age group(3)25Demography(5 year age groups correspond to the UN classification), which imparts theSMRC additional depth and, therefore, reduces the effect of internal structu-ral characteristics on the final result.The 1995 and 2010 SBRC and SMRC-based Ranking of Countriesand the Position of the Baltic RegionThe global SBRC and SMRC-based ranking is presented in tables 2 and 3.Our calculations allow to identify seven distinct groups in both cases. As tothe SBRC, in all countries of group one (a SBRC of 0.5 and lower), the birthrate would be twice or more as high if the age-specific incidence of the pro-cess were at the global average. However, the sixth (SBRC of 1.5—2.0) andseventh (SBRC of above 2.0) groups, whose core is predictably formed byAfrican countries at the early stage of demographic transitions, are characte-rised by values that significantly exceed the standard. In case of the SMRC,the first group (SMRC of 0.5 and lower) brings together countries that showa mortality rate significantly below the global average, whereas the sixth andthe sevenths groups are comprised by countries (SMRC of 1.5—2.0 and abo-ve 2.0), whose rates considerably exceed the global average.The development of BRC and SMRC-based rankings using an originalmethodology [2—4; 8; 9] for two selected years, and their comparison, makeit possible to identify the key trends, work with different scales, and conductanalysis at different territorial levels — those of individual countries, re-gions, and the entire world. The first attempt of a study from the global pers-pective resulted in a number of interesting observations and preliminaryconclusions, in particular, those based on the data of a final table of rankingchanges (table 4).There are a number of general conclusions that we can make fromstudying the data presented above. One, the world of demography remainshighly differentiated, and the range of indicator values is very wide. Two,spatial distribution of indicators corresponds to the global centre-peripherymodel, whose conditional core is the African region with the extraordinaryhigh both birth and mortality rates and the periphery the more developedcountries characterised, as a rule, by rather low rates. Three, global trends ofdecline in the birth and mortality rates exhibit different intensity on differentterritories. Moreover, there are numerous examples of reverse and ratherstable trends not only at the national, but also regional levels. Four, themedian group of countries is poorly represented in all SMRC and SBRC-based rankings (10—17 %), which is indicative of certain illusoriness ofglobal average values and requires adjustment in each individual case. Five,the 1995—2010 SBRC ranking structure is characterised by a process ofsmoothing the peak, extreme values, whereas an increasing number ofcountries consolidated within the range of the global average. If, in 1995, thethird — fifth groups accounted for less than 37 % of all countries, in 2010,the accounted for 50 %. Sixthly, the development of the SMRC rankingstructure over the same period is characterised by a process of polarisation,the core of the ranking loses its representatives in favour of the first (+ 2.03)and the seventh (+ 3,27) groups.26akulS.N,vonavI.D2elbaT0102dna5991neewtebgnikna, ,a yn niv ao meg rez Gre ,H eard o010 evn ,U2 lo enS ia, ra kita U,ic th ,k , -

Over the following years, a pronounced divergencebetween them emerged. Without going into detail (it is a subject for a sepa-rate study), one can state that, against the global demographic background,only Poland demonstrates a stable downward trends as to the birth rate andonly Germany is characterised by “negative stability”. The other countriesimproved their situation as compared to the global average by 2010.As to the SMRC, the overall trends in the regional development are po-sitive. The position of only two countries deteriorated of the period — Rus-sia moved down one position to group five and Lithuania to group four. Lat-via remained in the fourth group, whereas the other six Baltic region statesexperience a “demographic transition” that accompanied the positive trend.Today, with the exception of Poland and Estonia, they are in the group ofcountries with the lowest mortality rate in the world.The Baltic Region States in European RankingsFor a number of reasons, European countries have traditionally shown alow birth rate (SBRC < 1) at the global level, however, the situation is nothomogenous. Against this background, in 1995, the Baltic region statescomprised a rather coherent group with relatively favourable characteristics(tables 5, 6).31The SBRC of the Baltic Region States Vs. the Globaland European Average Standard of Age-specific Birthand Mortality rates in 1995 and 2010SBRC againstglobal average standard European average standard1995 2010 1995 20100.61 0.69 1.28 1.230.62 0.66 1.31 1.190.6 0.63 1.34 1.160.5 0.56 1.28 1.030.49 0.55 1.27 10.49 0.51 1.25 0.940.48 0.51 1.3 0.940.49 0.49 1.27 0.910.55 0.46 1.31 0.85DemographyTable 5Table 6Source: calculated using the data from [10; 11].The SMRC of the Baltic Region States Vs. the Globaland European Average Standard of Age-specific Birth and Mortality ratesin 1995 and 2010CountryDenmarkSwedenFinlandEstoniaLatviaLithuaniaRussiaGermanyPolandCountryDenmarkFinlandSwedenGermanyPolandEstoniaLatviaLithuaniaRussiaSMRC againstglobal average standard European average standard1995 2010 1995 20100.68 0.58 0.93 0.750.61 0.6 0.83 0.770.56 0.62 0.76 0.80.64 0.69 0.87 0.890.81 0.77 1.1 10.96 0.79 1.31 1.020.99 0.96 1.35 1.240.85 0.99 1.16 1.280.99 1.18 1.35 1.53In almost all countries, the SBRC was around 1.3, which means anincreased age-specific incidence of births against the European averagestandard. However, the following period saw a steep decline in the SBRC,although it did not occur at the same pace. As of 2010, Denmark retained itsposition in the ranking followed by Sweden and Finland. This situation is aresult of a number of factors, which include high standard of living and aconsistent policy aimed at increasing the birth rate pursued since the 1970s.Probably, a certain contribution is made by a large influx of migrants (in32D. Ivanov, N. SlukaSweden, they account for 15—19 % of population according to differentestimates) that exhibit increased fertility (often, of more than three childrenper woman of reproductive age). Four countries of the region — Estonia,Latvia, Lithuania, and Russia — are approximately at the European average,whereas Germany (despite the high standards of living and a large influx ofmigrates) and Poland are characterised by a gradual decrease in the birth ratesince the mid-1990s.The analysis shows that, in and around 1995, the mortality rate was theleading differentiating factor of the demographic situation in the Baltic re-gion states. While in the SBRC the countries show similar results, in theSMRC they are divided into two equal groups. The rates of the first groupare below the European average standard (Sweden, Finland, Germany, andDenmark), those of the second group are above that (Poland, the Baltics, andRussia). Over the next 15 years, the situation remained stable. The compo-sition of the first group and the values of the SMRC did not significantlychange, however, Denmark improved its position and topped the ranking.The trends characteristic of the second group of countries are more ambi-guous. For instance, Poland and, notably, Estonia reached the European ave-rage in terms of SMRC and occupied a central position in the Baltic regionranking against the background of a decrease in the age-specific incidence.An opposite trend is observed in Lithuania and Russia. The latter’s rate(1.53, sic!) emphasises the acuteness and depth of the demographic crisiscaused, according to experts, by a combination of numerous factors of demo-economic, socioeconomic, sociomedical, and socio-ethical nature.ConclusionThe search for new tools of a more accurate and effective assessment ofthe demographic situation in individual countries and regions made itpossible to discover a unified approach to developing demographic rankings(designed for and tested on Russian regions using the data of official Russianstatistics) in the works of S. P. Ermakov and N. A. Shmakov [2—4; 8; 9].Standardised birth and mortality rates minimise the significance of structuraldifferences in the population of different territories. Therefore, it becomespossible to make comparisons at any level — from the global to municipalone. The first attempt to apply the method to long-term internationalstatistical data proved its validity and applicability to the studies in the field.Notable conclusions regarding the nature of certain development trends inthe birth and mortality rates in both the global and macroregional contextwere achieved. New experimental data were obtained and the features ofdevelopment of demographic processes in the Baltic region were identified.At the same time, the results obtained require further investigation, detailedinterpretation, and an in-depth analysis, also that at the level of individualcountries and regions. Moreover, the “pure” data on the condition of popula-tion and demographic processes seems to be important for all relevant autho-rities. This information can be used in the formulation and targeted imple-mentation of both demographic and social policies.33DemographyReferences<ref><ref><ref>1. Medkov, V.
