Participatory Rural Appraisal:Lessons for Countries in the North?Julia PreeceThis paper describes and analyses various perspectives on participatoryrural appraisal and the relationship between its rhetoric and practice,particularly regarding its claims to give voice to the marginalised andcontribution to development needs. Drawing on relevant literature thatboth critiques and provides examples of practice, the paper analyses twocase studies to explore what lessons we can learn about the approachand its applicability as a methodology for marginalised social groups inEuropean contexts.Key words: Participatory, appraisal, research, methodology, ethics1. IntroductionParticipatory rural appraisal (PRA) … is a holistic, all encompassing datacollection exercise about a whole community. The research process is putas far as possible into the hands of ordinary people. Although ‘experts’(the community educators) are involved, their role is to facilitate, not takeover, the investigation. It has very practical goals. The aim of the inquiryis to obtain a detailed understanding and analysis of a specific local con-text; then for local people to prioritise their needs based on this enhancedunderstanding. The outcome of this process is a community action plan,devised with a view to helping local communities solve their own prob-lems through different local initiatives. The PRA embraces diversity. Itcan be applied in a range of adult education contexts, such as health, agri-culture, biodiversity and urban planning. It is used to address specific Af-International Journal of Action Research 2(2), 198-221ISSN 1861-1303 (print), ISSN 1861-9916 (internet), © Rainer Hampp Verlag, www.Hampp-Verlag.deParticipatory Rural Appraisal 199rican problems such as desertification, low food production, decliningproductivity and fuelwood shortage. PRA, then, is: ‘built on the premisethat participation by the beneficiaries in any project is fundamental’ andthat ‘locally developed technologies are more likely to succeed’ in build-ing community confidence and capacity (Egerton University 2000, 4). Itsstrategy is to encourage the use of local cultural values, organisations andknowledge systems for solving problems. The community is involved inevery stage of the PRA process (Chilisa/Preece 2005: 198).PRA emanated from countries in the global South1 as a strategy to involvepoor rural communities in their own development. Drawing on relevant lit-erature this paper will explore to what extent PRA lives up to its rhetoric, andhow effectively it contributes to sustainable outcomes. The paper will alsoexplore what lessons we can learn about PRA and its applicability as a meth-odology for marginalised social groups in European contexts. We begin witha brief introduction to the evolution of PRA as a participatory methodology.2. Evolution of participatory methodologiesTraditional research approaches are often criticised for failing to address is-sues of ownership and control or power relations between the ‘expert aca-demic’ and practitioner or layperson involved in the study (Green et al.1995). Countries from the so called developing world have particularlyvoiced their concerns about the way powerful outsiders investigate localcommunities with only partial knowledge of local contexts (Mulenga 1999).The concept of participatory research, as an antidote to these criticisms, hasevolved from a number of directions. On the one hand development agenciesand policymakers who sought quick access to socio economic data were re-sponding to critiques of trickle down economic development theory and con-cerns about top-down development without consultation with local communi-ties (Boyde 2000; Campbell 2002; Hayward et al. 2004); on the other hand1The global South is one of many terms given to countries such as Africa and Asiawhich are seen as in need of development aid. All terms have derogatory and someti-mes inaccurate connotations. It was felt that this particular term is less offensive thanother ones currently in use, whilst recognising that no term accurately describes such arange of countries or their circumstances.200 Julia Preececommunities themselves have increased their demands to be included in deci-sions that affected their daily lives (Hayward et al. 2004). Furthermore, in thepast decade there has been increasing emphasis on the need to respect multi-ple voices and a reluctance among researchers to speak for the ‘other’ in con-texts where there were significant power differentials between the researcherand the researched (Cottrell and Parpart 2006). Collaboration and participa-tion have now become an ethical issue in their own right, particularly for thepoor and marginalised:In order for pro-poor development to become a reality, poor people them-selves must be not only involved as respondents, but also have access tothe information generated, a role in its analysis and in identifying the prac-tical implications for change (Chambers/Mayoux 2005: 7).Gray et al. (2000: 244) argue that the philosophical commitment to participa-tory research has been influenced by these two traditions – third world devel-opment and action research – now ‘subsumed under the unifying umbrella ofparticipatory research’. Participatory methods claimed to produce knowledgethat was more valid and reliable in representing context specific ways ofknowing the social world (Campbell 2002).The range of terminologies that come under this unifying umbrella areconsiderable. They include: participatory research, participatory action re-search, action research, collaborative enquiry, emancipatory research and par-ticipatory rural appraisal amongst others (Green et al. 1995). They are seen asbeing positioned within a range of radical theories such as neo-Marxism,critical theory and feminist frameworks (Mulenga 1999). Fox (2006) suggeststhat many of these research terms are complementary but different in theirapproach and purpose. They seem to lie along a continuum of radical to lib-eral goals. At the more radical end he includes amongst them such terms as‘power-structure research’- as pioneered in Latin America. Here the goal is toreveal injustices and pressure points in the system that causes these injusticesso people’s anger will provoke them into targeted action (Fox 2006: 27). Onthe other hand he sees the ‘testimonial research’ of many feminist scholars asa means of enabling marginalised voices and histories to be heard, so that the‘other’ is better understood in context. Other participatory research may befocused on making invisible problems visible, so as to redefine what countsParticipatory Rural Appraisal 201as a problem and enable us to see, for example, that environmental threats areintertwined with issues of race or class. But there is a common goal of allthese terms to shift the focus away from the researcher, who simply raisesawareness amongst the researched, to a goal of mutual learning and agendasharing amongst researchers and participants.So what are the distinctive features of participatory rural appraisal? Anddoes it achieve what it claims to do?3. Participatory rural appraisalTo answer these questions we must briefly explore the origins of the term andlook at some of its characteristics. Southern contexts such as Latin America(Percy 1999) and Africa (De Vos 1998 and Mulenga 1999) are often cited asthe source of participatory research as a response to development methodsthat were being overshadowed by neo-colonial interference:Critics of African development such as Julius Nyerere of Tanzania arguedthat any meaningful development could only be achieved if the people’sculture and popular knowledges were integrated into the process (Mulenga1999: 3).There were problems with the term participatory research in African devel-opment contexts, however. Development agencies were using the word to-kenistically without transferring any real ownership of the research process orits outcomes. Centralised, top down approaches to development had left therural poor increasingly dependent on public provision with no sense of own-ership over their own destiny (Chilisa/Preece 2005: 197). Since 2002 decen-tralised governance systems in many countries have provided the impetus tocascade decision making responsibilities down to local communities. This re-quired in most cases a re-training of institutional officers to build confidencein community leadership structures.To facilitate this transition, participatory rural appraisal was offered as aresponse to policy maker and aid agency needs for quick access to socio eco-nomic data at local levels (Campbell 2002). Drawing on Chambers’ work,Campbell (2002: 21) states that it embodies five principles: to function as atrade-off between the traditional preference for quantifiable data and the real-202 Julia Preeceity need to collect relevant information; to counteract the biases of develop-ment tourism; to serve as a triangulation method; to provide a flexible way oflearning directly from and with rural people; and to be an interactive processthat embraces diversity and multiple realities. The goal of PRA is to maxi-mise the skills, knowledge, expertise and analytical skills of village commu-nities through a process of data collection, discussion of issues and possiblesolutions and the creation of an agreed community action plan that will notonly include action by community members themselves, but also engage offi-cials over an agreed timescale. Sometimes the community may raise a par-ticular problem, but more often than not a change agent initiates the process.The people engaged in PRA are not necessarily trained researchers, as thecase studies cited in the latter part of this paper demonstrate. Often, therefore,there is a requirement that officials, such as extension workers in rural com-munities, have to review their whole approach to their development responsi-bilities. Instead of seeing farmers or other client groups as mere recipients ofnew techniques or information provided by the extension workers, for in-stance, the participatory appraisal approach requires a new form of engage-ment, whereby extension workers listen and farmers articulate their localknowledge in a shared process of learning and working together to look forsolutions to identified problems (Percy 1999). It is sometimes argued that themain gain from this process is what the researcher-facilitators learn abouttheir clients’ own skills and understanding, rather than new technical knowl-edge that can guide the goal for change or development (Doyle/Krasny2003).PRA has now evolved into a methodology for use in a variety of situationsincluding urban communities, and it is often now simply known as participa-tory appraisal (PEANuT 2005). While its primary goal is to transfer owner-ship of knowledge creation to communities, it does more than simply gatherdata, however, since action is the intended outcome. There is an explicit aimto reduce the distance between the researcher and the researched (Gray et al.2000) and the research process has come to be defined as:Systematic inquiry, with the collaboration of those affected by the issuebeing studied, for the purposes of education and taking action or effectingsocial change (Green et al. 1995: 54).Participatory Rural Appraisal 203The processThe goal of the participatory appraisal (PA) process is to be as inclusive aspossible in collecting views from across the community population. This usu-ally involves several people acting as facilitators, rather than interaction withone researcher. Data collection techniques are designed to be useableamongst communities where literacy levels are low. PA has been describedas embracing a family of methods and approaches that involve group basedlearning and planning, using different techniques to investigate an issue fromseveral different angles (Kapoor 2002). The aim is to gradually build up aknowledge base of whole communities through visual activities, walks, dis-cussions, role play, interviews, photos, seasonal calendars, diagrams – ex-ploring what people think, how they live their lives and specific cultural do-mains of those lives. By recording information from such a diverse range oftechniques, and feeding back to community members they are challenged toconsider perspectives other than their own in the effort to find common solu-tions. Many of the techniques are borrowed from qualitative social research,though the emphasis is on visual and group data, rather than individualisedinformation.Handbooks for conducting the PA process are documented from a varietyof sources (for example Egerton University 2000;<ref> Trust for Community Out-reach and Education 2001; Chambers 2002). Although diver</ref>sity and flexibil-ity is encouraged there is a recommended approach that maximises commu-nity involvement. The Egerton University PRA Field Handbook (2000, 4)proposed eight steps for an external facilitator in the African village context,in the following order: site selection; preliminary site visits to establish con-tact and build relationships; public announcement of activities through tradi-tional information dissemination meetings; data gathering; data collation andanalysis; preparation of the community action plan; adoption of the plan andstrategies for its implementation; and then ongoing participatory monitoringand evaluation. Community members are usually recruited as co-research fa-cilitators, and also to bridge communication gaps with various populationsectors. Whilst the notion of ‘community’, for these purposes, originated as a‘village community’ it may in different contexts be translated more broadly204 Julia Preeceas, for example, business community (Michaels et al 2001) or special interestgroup community (Taylor 1999).Data is collected over an extended period. Since this is done in a varietyof ways it is often fragmented and needs to be organised by the facilitators,whilst allowing the community members themselves to make sense of thewhole. It is often the style of data collection which gives participatory ap-praisal its distinctive feel. Maps are often constructed out of local materialson the ground and only copied onto paper once they are completed. The mapevolves through discussion and identification of particular issues. A ‘transectmap’ is effectively a walking map, where community members walk througha particular area and talk about various landmarks or activities. In similarfashion, people can discuss interagency links by physically grouping them-selves into large Venn diagrams drawn on the ground, using coloured ribbonor other resources to signify connections or communication links, dependingon the community context (Michaels et al. 2001). Other examples of data col-lection include timelines that list key events in the life of a community, sea-sonal and daily calendars that record activities for men and women, liveli-hood maps that list the resources a household needs on a daily basis andwhere they collect them from. Issues for men and women are often discussedseparately, revealing the problematics of gendered decision making in oneAfrican context, as the following extract shows:It was no surprise that the problems which the women raised were differ-ent from those of the men. Shortage of wood for fuel is a major problemfor the women, for example, as they often have to spend many hourssearching for it, and they were therefore very interested in economicalstoves. Traditional harmful practices such as circumcision were also men-tioned by the women.The men were more interested in training in non-agricultural fields. Inboth villages in Oromia, almost half the population no longer have enoughland to be able to live off what it produces. These men, most of whom areyoung, have to hire themselves out as wage labourers on other farms, as-suming that they find work at all (Burkhardt 2000: 310-311).Participatory Rural Appraisal 205During all these activities problems issues and solutions are discussed and re-corded. Occasionally technical data (such as soil testing) is included at therequest of the community.If the discussions have been facilitated effectively the causes and potentialsolutions to problems will be emerging throughout the process in readinessfor action planning. At this stage community members often divide into the-matic groups to address particular issues in more detail. The PA team facili-tate decision making by drawing attention to the recorded discussions, includ-ing references to solutions that may have worked in the past. Community ac-tion planning is undertaken through the same participative process, includingany identification of training needs that would facilitate action and monitor-ing. An example of such a discussion process is taken from the Trust forCommunity Outreach and Education (TCOE) Training Manual (2001). Thisparticular scenario represents the final stages of a community empowermentprocess, facilitated by Nondwe, and designed to address poverty issues in aSouth African township:Together they analysed the summaries … After a while clear patterns be-gan to emerge …. After a short while, as people calmed down, Nondweput up a big drawing …. Then she asked … ‘why is there a higher rate ofgastroenteritis among children living on the south side of Umzekelo alongthe banks of the river?’ ‘Because they play in the river most often’, saidsomeone. ‘Yes but who lives there?’ …’the poorest of the poor live in thatarea’ … Then Eunice got up again and said: ‘That’s another thing our in-vestigation revealed. Gastroenteritis is more prevalent in the areas ofgreatest poverty in Umzekelo. And infants who get gastroenteritis aremore likely to die from dehydration’ ….With Nondwe’s careful facilita-tion, people first began to use their growing understanding of local condi-tions (TCOE 2001: 185) …All that was left to do now was to plan ….Several women … said they would like to present a play based on whatthey had learnt …Eunice said that she would like to borrow her churchminister’s camera and document the health and sanitation problems(TCOE 2001: 191).This example demonstrates that the facilitator needs to be highly skilled atgroup dynamics, organisation data management and critical awareness rais-ing. Participatory data collection evolves into participatory education in order206 Julia Preeceto arrive at collective action for empowerment and change. Freirian notionsof conscientisation or Brookfield’s (1987) description of critical thinkingwould be appropriate pedagogical skills for the facilitator-as-researcher here.The effectiveness of the process is heavily dependent on how it is managedby the research leaders.4. Critiques of the processThe rhetoric of participation, empowerment and development and the poten-tial of the process to produce sustainable outcomes have come under increas-ing scrutiny, however. The criticisms relate to methodological, outcome andethical concerns.4.1Participation techniquesHayward and Simpson (2004) point out that the experience of participation isnot always a positive experience for the participants in developing countriesin terms of inclusiveness and ownership. Often this reflects poor training onthe part of facilitators who are either trained by or are Westerners. The choiceof technique may reflect the importing of implicit western cultural bias intodifferent cultural contexts (Campbell 2002). Some data gathering tools canfail to address issues of gender, age or lifestyle (Boyde 2000) meaning thatthe participants themselves often have to learn new skills in order to partici-pate at all and the nature of the data collected still reflects the goals of the re-searchers. Boyde points out that PRA techniques, in their effort to counteractcriticisms of bias in quantitative methods, fail to acknowledge that no datagathering tool is entirely value free. For example visualisation strategies de-signed to enable local people to conduct their own analysis and action plansmay fail to take into account the controlling role that facilitators play in steer-ing the group deliberations. Similarly group interviews themselves may ‘notaddress the problem of selecting members to groups, the composition of thegroup, or the role of the moderator’ (Campbell 2002: 24). In close associationwith this concern Green et al (1995) highlight the concern of representative-ness. If only a few self selected individuals take part in the appraisal processthey may purport to represent the views of many when this is not the case.Participatory Rural Appraisal 207Chambers and Mayoux (2005: 26) acknowledge that there may be problemsin who participates or people’s willingness to contribute. Campbell sumsthese issues up as a lack of transparency in reporting the techniques and pro-cedures used and lack of flexibility in adjusting to context.Boyde (2000) adds to these concerns by pointing out that PRAs are oftenconducted by non governmental organisations (NGOs) which are rarely lo-cally owned so this results in a ‘subtle top-down intervention, controlled andmanaged by external forces’ so that participation actually becomes ‘covertmanipulation’ (pages unnumbered). He also reminds us that many of theproblems which communities unearth can be attributed to wider structuralconcerns, over which the facilitators of PRA projects have little control.Sometimes these issues become so large that the process pays insufficient at-tention to highlighting local strengths that could solve more focused prob-lems. At other times there are attempts by researchers to claim more gener-alisable outcomes than localised context specific situations can reflect.The issue of power relations in PRA methodologies, can therefore be hid-den in the discourse of ‘participatory’, thus re-creating all the problems thatparticipatory research claims to overcome. For instance Kapoor (2002) statesthat there is no quality assurance over the PRA process to ensure that discus-sions are coercion free or the facilitator is not abusing his or her power andauthority (p.108). Kapoor also points out that it is unclear how PRA providesopportunities to critique which community claims are erroneous. Further-more, Boyde (2000), Mulenga (1999) and others’ concerns that there is an in-evitable tension between the development practitioner’s values and personalagendas and those of the more career oriented and institutionally pressurisedacademic require a constant trade-off between the ideology of participationand the reality of the research process. Cottrell and Parpart (2006) suggestthat frank and open discussions from the beginning may help to resolve someof these issues.Finally Kapoor (2002) articulates the concern that participatory appraisalliterature is under-theorised. Although issues of empowerment and participa-tion are central to its work, there is almost no reference to theoretical notionsof power or democracy. He cites Foucault’s concept of power as a relation-ship and the role that power plays in legitimising knowledge. He also refers208 Julia Preeceto Habermasian literature that discusses deliberative democracy as a strategyfor challenging the state. The absence of such a critical theoretical overview,he argues, means that ‘difference’ is denied in the pursuit of consensus andpolitical activism is suppressed in favour of liberalism (Kapoor 2002: 114f.).Many of the above criticisms could apply to the mis-use of any methodol-ogy, of course. Chambers and Mayoux (2005) suggest we should look at theproblem slightly differently. For instance we should ask how reliable is thealternative – quantitative, top down collected data - in addressing the aboveconcerns, especially those of power relations and the inter-linkages betweenmulti-dimensional aspects of poverty (Chambers/Mayoux 2005: 4). Fromhere we can look for ways to enhance the quality of participatory methodolo-gies, to minimise their deficiencies. Chambers and Mayoux point out that lo-cal people’s knowledge is more useful for community analysis than ‘official’information. But, as the TCOE extract indicated, there is a need for appropri-ate training of facilitators, cultural sensitising and pilot testing of methods.Also analysis should be ongoing, rather than short, one-off exercises. The tri-angulation process is necessary to offset concerns of bias or representative-ness, but the range of tools used need not include diagrams or methods thatare inappropriate for any particular circumstance. Chambers and Mayoux ar-gue that although empowerment cannot be assumed, the methods, when usedsensitively and correctly have greater potential to increase accountability inthe development process:The main challenge is not rigour, but how to enable the poorest to have avoice in definitions and policies for pro-poor growth and civil society de-velopment in the face of institutional prejudice against a process whichchallenges conventional norms of expertise and power relations (Cham-bers/Mayoux 2005: 18).4.2Ethical questionsSo, they and others argue, it is down to questions of ethics as to whose voicesare taken seriously and to whom the data belongs. Such concerns include en-suring sensitive community data is not put into the wrong hands – at commu-nity or local government level. Questions that must be asked of the PA pro-ject include: Whose interests are being served? Whose indicators are mostParticipatory Rural Appraisal 209relevant for assessing the development process? Whose numbers count?Whose analysis is most relevant and reliable? Who needs the information?Who is most likely to be empowered in the process? (Chambers/Mayoux2005: 18). Boyde (2000) adds a further question: ‘Is this a search to discoversomething from which all parties can learn?’ (pages unnumbered) and invitesus to consider whether the documented outcomes will really help to improvethe situation of the least powerful. In other words, whose voices are beingheard? Chambers and Mayoux (2005) also raise the issue of how much com-munity time it is ethical to demand of people who are using all their energy tosustain themselves and how much of the data should be removed for analysisfrom outside of the community itself. Kapoor, however, points out the dangerof placing so much emphasis on accepting the validity of community data atthe expense of injecting a critical stance into the process:To privilege what is is often to unquestioningly accept the status quo …can mean simplifying or ignoring broader relationships between say localcommunities and socio economic power structures (Kapoor 2002: 102).We can see, therefore, that the participatory appraisal approach requires sen-sitivity, cultural awareness, and a commitment to giving voice to the disad-vantaged. At the same time it requires an ethical commitment to respect di-versity and difference whilst also facilitating awareness raising and ultimatelyempowerment through highlighting contradictions in people’s stories, situa-tions and perspectives. The action plan must tread a fine line between toomuch or too little control and the creation of realistic agendas for change. Inparticular participants must be facilitated in such a way that they learn to cri-tique themselves and their findings. In adult education terms this cuts across aFrierian conscientisation process or Habermasian concept of deliberative de-mocracy, within feminist or similar critical frameworks that are sensitive toissues of power. An analysis of two case studies taken from very differentsituations shows the degree of reflexivity required by researchers if they areto maintain an ethical balance. They show the trade-offs or compromises aswell as potential for flexibility that participatory appraisal generates and theyalso demonstrate the applicability of this approach in widely different con-texts.210 Julia Preece5. Case studiesThe author of this paper has used certain aspects of PRA methods as a re-searcher (see Preece/Ntseane 2003 for example)2 and has also been privy todiscussions amongst rural development government officers in Botswanaabout community action plan implementation concerns, and the degree towhich PRA can overcome ethnicity exclusions (Mompati and Prinsen 2000).However, recent funding failures have delayed the opportunity for a plannedcomparative study in PRA. This paper therefore draws on existing literatureto critique two case studies in an attempt to reflect on the learning that tookplace between the researchers and their target participants and the extent towhich action for change took place.5.1Example oneThe first example is taken from a World Bank funded project in April 1995(Massiah 1997). Its significance lies in the fact that this was, at the time, aninnovation for World Bank engagement in non quantitative studies. Its sig-nificance also lies in the extent to which the report could be assessed as fol-lowing a community agenda that would result in community owned out-comes. The report describes the first phase of a project to prevent sexuallytransmitted diseases and HIV infection in three communities in Nigeria’s Pla-teau State. The research team consisted of personnel from the State Ministryof Health, AIDS Action Managers in the participating local authorities, a uni-versity academic and representative from the World Bank. University stu-dents who spoke the local languages served as interviewers during the fieldwork.2The author was a member of a small team which conducted several open ended focusgroup discussions with employees in Botswana based companies where employeesdiscussed culturally contextual issues, concerns and possible solutions to the country’sHIV/AIDS pandemic. These responses were then organised into a three-person dialo-gue drama that was played back to the focus groups who responded in terms of actionthey were prepared to agree with, or not. The author has also participated with Africanand British students and academics in a participatory appraisal training workshop whe-re participants undertook a variety of appraisal activities including thematicallyorganising and prioritising issues raised by the group, pair ranking and action plan-ning, visual construction of concepts and producing historical time lines.Participatory Rural Appraisal 211The problem situation identified by the researchers was that HIV andsyphilis prevalence rates in Nigeria were increasing and the Plateau State hadthe highest levels in the country. The goal was to collect information aboutSTD/AIDS that could inform subsequent monitoring activities in the areas.The criteria for site selection was that each district contained at least one pri-vate or public health facility and was accessible by road. The three sites arebriefly described as follows. Jos North local government authority includesthe capital city and is a prime trading centre for long distance truck drivers. Italso includes two smaller and more traditional communities that have threedifferent ethnic populations. Mangu local authority has both an urban and ru-ral settlement with four different ethnic groups and the third local govern-ment authority, Langtang, is primarily rural with limited transport facilities.The process of involvement was conducted by the local authority AIDSAction Managers through village elders who introduced the team to theircommunities. The precise means of selecting the target group is not describedin the report (merely saying that ‘participants were selected by their owncommunities’ (Massiah 1997: 42), but they consisted of professional healthworkers, traditional healers and pharmacists, male and female communitymembers, long distant truck drivers and STD patients. Interviews with com-mercial sex workers and village elders were conducted by the AIDS ActionManagers. Questions related to identifying and prioritising development con-cerns and health concerns. A total of 16 data collection methods were used,including social and institutional mapping, interviews, and matrix ranking.Data was collected over a period of two weeks.Findings were reported bilingually by the team to community meetings, inthe form of participatory workshops consisting of participants in the field-work. The research coordinator summarised the research findings and com-munity members commented on issues, prioritised and added to them. A keyrecommendation in relation to the focus of the study was that health educa-tion should be provided in local languages and be distributed through moretraditional communication routes rather than as posters written in English. Anumber of recommendations for decreasing confusions about picture contentin the HIV/AIDS prevention posters were also made. In addition problems ofliteracy, education, roads and water supply were highlighted by the commu-212 Julia Preecenity, along with general health concerns such as malaria. Cultural and reli-gious norms impacted on health and sexual behaviour generally. An impor-tant recommendation included the need to foster collaboration between tradi-tional and medical care providers, since community members relied on tradi-tional healers far more than the professionals had realised.CommentaryA significant feature of the findings was that the communities themselves didnot rank STDs and HIV/AIDS as their main health concerns:In general, women perceive childhood diseases as priorities, and they rankthem higher than men do. Among women, the main health concerns aremeasles, dysentery / diarrhea, and hypertension; men’s main health con-cerns are meningitis, typhoid, and hernia. Malaria is mentioned more bymen than women ….. Doctors and nurses identify similar health priorities(Massiah 1997: 16).Indeed lack of health care facilities generally were secondary to wider devel-opment concerns related to poverty, such as existence of potable water, ac-cess to credit and agriculture markets (Massiah 1997: 14). Yet the project’spriorities were STDs and AIDS. This remains the title of the project and theseitems are the only ones identified in the report summary. This would suggestthat although the consultation process was adhered to as a strategy, the re-search team still filtered out the issues that they intended to spend their ener-gies on.Another concern is the nature of who participated. Whilst key people wereidentified through traditional community structures, it has already been high-lighted that minority ethnic groups are often marginalised in this processsince traditional expectations of entitlement and participation can intercede.Mompati and Prinsen (2000), for instance, describe how the participatory ap-praisal process in Botswana resulted in minority ethnic groups and womenbeing systematically excluded from consultation opportunities, or beingwithdrawn from meetings if they spoke out against dominant values. TheWorld Bank report makes no observation about problems that may havearisen during consultation processes, other than recognising that the lack ofParticipatory Rural Appraisal 213sustained support at community action planning stages is a reason for failureto implement changes. Furthermore, whilst the field work of two weeks wasidentified as time consuming, reference is not made to the length of time theworkers took to gain access to these communities. Although some of theteams would have been relatively well known to the communities, some maynot have been, suggesting that barriers of trust may not have fully dissipatedduring such a short time-frame.Nevertheless reflection amongst the researchers suggested that the activityitself had built cross-sectoral partnerships and raised the professionals’ con-sciousness of their own biases towards community members, a clearer under-standing of the dynamics of community behaviours and interpretation ofhealth messages, and the potential of communities to identify solutions totheir own problems (Massiah 1997: 2). These latter features were a signifi-cant finding of Youngman and Maruatona (1998) during their assessment of apilot PRA project in Botswana. A key learning curve for appraisal teams is torealise that their communities have relevant skills and knowledge and can ac-tively engage in programme research.For the community members it was felt that the PRA process had facili-tated new partnerships and lines of accountability though they expressedscepticism about the likelihood that action would be taken without sufficientfollow-up and input from relevant professionals (Massiah 1997: 2). The issueof sustainability is highlighted particularly when there is a perceived distancebetween the appraisal team and community members themselves. In spite ofits innovatory nature for the World Bank, this project still reflected a topdown structure whose limitations filtered through to the participants them-selves. A theoretical understanding in terms of power relations or group dy-namics was not discussed.5.2Example twoThe second case study transports us into a Western context, but still with mi-nority ethnic groups. Doyle and Krasny (2003) describe a project which en-gaged American youth in learning about ethnic gardening practices using re-search methods adapted from participatory rural appraisal. The context for214 Julia Preecethis project focuses on issues of intergenerational and ethnic marginalisationin poor American urban neighbourhoods. The youth and community garden-ers were low income Puerto Ricans, Hispanic immigrants and African Ame-ricans with roots in the American south:Community gardeners in the US tend to be low-income minorities and re-cent immigrants living in apartment buildings in neighbourhoods with lit-tle open space and few grocery stores that carry fresh fruit and vegetables.They voluntarily work in the gardens, which provide a place to socialize,relax and appreciate nature, and a means of accessing fresh produce(Doyle/Krasny 2003: 94).The project was stimulated by cooperative extension educators who wantedto use PRA as an educational/community action tool for local youth from thesame minority backgrounds as the adult community gardeners. The youthwould be trained as PRA researchers to document gardening practices andthen conduct community action based on their results. The idea was to stimu-late interest in ‘urban agro-ecology and food systems’ to compensate for thelack of grocery stores. The youth in this case were therefore both researcher-facilitators but also community members who would be expected to subse-quently undertake their own action with their elders. The educators bothtrained the youth and maintained a presence throughout the PRA exercise,sometimes sharing responsibility for the data collection when the youth en-countered difficulties. The self reflection process therefore took place at threelevels – the gardeners, the youth researchers, the educators. Six PRA methodswere used – a visual time-line and interviews to document garden history,mapping of plots and gardens and seasonal calendar to identify planting prac-tices, soil tests, Venn diagrams to locate resource flows within the widercommunity, followed by a shared action plan between gardeners and youth toidentify problems and solutions. The project took place over several weeksduring the long summer vacation.A total of 31 educators involved 85 youth to work with 26 gardenersacross seven neighbourhoods. Youth participants were drawn from commu-nity centres and school gardening programmes serving low-income children.The project author (Doyle) conducted her own assessment of the total processthrough observations, interactions and interviews at the beginning, middleParticipatory Rural Appraisal 215and end of the programme, supplemented by end of project focus groups andyouth diaries. Ultimately only four sites followed the full PRA process.A significant action outcome for the project was that youth at two sitesstarted their own garden and at a third site youth developed long term men-toring relationships with their neighbourhood gardeners. They also gavepresentations about their findings to gardeners and community members at agarden event and county fairs.Doyle and Krasny (2003) report that the youth experienced some chal-lenges in facilitating the more hands-on activities such as mapping and dia-grams and sometimes the educators helped to adapt the processes, for exam-ple by encouraging the youth to interpret the Venn diagram activity as a‘puzzle about how the people fit together within the garden’ (p.96). Therewere also some language and cultural differences between the youth re-searchers and minority ethnic community members. More practical issues todo with time management, transport and attention spans were also cited(Doyle/Krasny 2003: 103). The youth found interviewing a more familiartechnique, stimulated by the fact that the gardeners loved telling stories, butthe gardeners felt more awkward when asked to draw a map or diagram.Nevertheless, they eventually became deeply engaged in mapping their plots,when the youth started drawing a map and asking gardeners for help in fillingthe details. The message here, of course, is to fit methods to context.The expertise of the older, minority ethnic research ‘subjects’ and the agedifferentials for the youth researchers suggest that perhaps power differentialsand the subsequent learning processes were unusually complementary in thisproject. So, for instance, the youth acquired substantial historical knowledgeabout the evolution of the gardens, the influence of surrounding environmentsuch as pollution on the gardens and connections between the garden andbroader city. They increased their knowledge about soils and soil testing.Through the necessary listening process of interviewing they were able tobuild a relationship with the gardeners. By the same token the educatorslearned to respect the young adults’ own ability to take initiative:I would say [to the youth], ‘Do you want me to go over to the gardenerwith you? Do you want me to do anything or just be here?’ They’d say,216 Julia Preece‘No, just be here,’ and they’d come back and I’d let them tell me how itwent. …(Educator, Philadelphia) (Doyle/Krasny 2003: 97)The activities also generated insights about people and emotions associatedwith gardening, as well as sustainability issues and the contribution the prod-ucts made to the community. From the gardeners’ perspectives the interac-tions enhanced their own self respect and feeling of belonging (Doyle/Krasny2003: 104).CommentaryReflections on the total action research process highlighted the difficulties inbalancing a complex set of research, education and community action objec-tives. It was felt that the educational outcomes were achieved more success-fully than research outcomes, with consequences for sustainable action.Equally the ‘total participation’ of youth and gardeners in determining objec-tives and devising research questions was subliminated by the educators’overall control of the whole process, although youth were encouraged to addresearch questions of their own. The gardeners themselves were confusedabout their role in the exercise, sometimes believing they were teachers ratherthan participants in a shared objective. The youths’ own communication andacademic skills varied, with consequent outcomes for their engagement in allthe activities. A general observation was that all participants needed longerpreparation time to fully understand the PRA process.This was a complex and ambitious arrangement that made genuine at-tempts to involve people who would not normally have a voice in their owncommunity. It perhaps lacked direction in that the objectives for change werenot clear, and the mutual roles of each layer of participant were not alwaysunderstood. Perhaps the greatest gain – as for the World Bank study – was inthe breaking down of misconceptions and inter-generational stereotype ex-pectations of each other.6. Lessons to be learned?A number of observations can be made concerning the relevance of literaturearguments about Participatory appraisal in analysing these two case studies.Participatory Rural Appraisal 217On the plus side the above cases demonstrate the versatility of the partici-patory approach to a variety of situations around the world. The distinctive-ness of participatory rural appraisal – or participatory appraisal (PA) as it isnow coming to be known – originated as a methodology that was applied torural communities where literacy levels were low and were people felt re-moved from public decision making processes. These issues can be appliedglobally to marginalised groups and people whose levels of literacy, orknowledge of technical language, is less than that of people making decisionsthat affect their lives. PA not only broadens the range of strategies availableto low literacy groups. It can also be effective in community mobilisation.The studies demonstrated the opportunity for data collection partnerships thatwould not otherwise have existed and created new dynamics between the re-searchers and participants. As a result of these opportunities and dynamics,knowledge was secured that would otherwise have been hidden (for example,the extent to which community members in the African context use tradi-tional healers in relation to conventional medical resources). New knowledgeoften then emerges as a re-working of solutions that are context sensitive.The outcomes should not be overstated, but methods can be used to provideinnovative ways of engaging with marginalised social groups, and adapted tosuit particular circumstances. In addition to the above examples it has beenused in situations that can range from health care situations (Gray et al 2000),to team building (Michaels et al 2001).However, there are some pervading issues. For instance, another continu-ing distinctiveness of participatory appraisal from other forms of participa-tory research perhaps lies in the criticism that it is under-theorised. Thereinlies the rub. A more theoretical approach (perhaps using Third World Femi-nisms or post colonial analysis as a framework) might give the methodologyacademic credibility within institutions. Consequently, its strength as a user-friendly signifier of research that de-mystifies its language and accessibilityto marginalised research participants might be compromised and challengethe overall purpose of retaining knowledge within the community. Anotherweakness of many participatory appraisals is not so much the collection or re-liability of data, but the effectiveness of subsequent action plans. Perhaps away forward would be to persuade funding sources to support research pro-218 Julia Preecegrammes that allowed for more deliberative community engagement overlonger periods of time to enable communities themselves to critique, ratherthan simply participate in, participatory research.Both cases also highlight that the situation to be changed is rarely identi-fied by the target participants. It is the external agent who stimulates the ex-ploration of the issue and the participants contribute to identifying the com-plexity or detail of the issue or problem situation. Therefore, the extent towhich participatory appraisal is a truly grass roots led process is entirely de-pendent on how flexible the researchers are prepared to be regarding researchoutcomes. In the World Bank study for instance, the target issue ofHIV/AIDS was not a priority for the participant communities. It is question-able, therefore, what sustainable outcomes would have been achieved fromthe community perspectives, since funding would have been linked to anagenda for HIV/AIDS change strategies alone. In the urban garden projectfollow up action did ensue, but it was not necessarily action for change and itwas not clear whether any such action had been prioritised.An overall criticism of the quality of, and suitability of, data gatheringtechniques lies, arguably, not just in the newness of those techniques but alsoin the quality of facilitation training. The case studies cited above seem toshare the need for facilitation skills that derive from good adult educationpractice. So participatory appraisal methodologies require a combination ofpedagogical and cultural sensitivity skills that stretch beyond those normallyrequired of a lone researcher who may be more practised at moving into a re-search environment, collecting data and then moving back out to analyse itindependently. Whilst methods are adaptable, there is sometimes an apparentmismatch between the researcher-facilitator’s skills and the participants’skills and understanding. Again time and flexibility need to accommodatethese concerns.Other criticisms of PA’s credibility as a research approach must also takeinto account that no research is value free. Participatory research is not de-signed to produce a universal truth but it does aim to produce somethingvaluable for the participants. Action research is centred around engagingpeople in a critique of their present situation to improve practice for the fu-ture. Both case studies were attempting to contribute to the quality of life ofParticipatory Rural Appraisal 219poor communities. The impact on sustainable development and poverty re-duction will depend to what extent the outcomes can move us towards thatgoal. In view of the fact that poverty is multi dimensional and multi-directional (Eversole/Routh 2005) it would seem important to operationlisethe findings at several levels. As researchers we also have a responsibility toreach as large an audience as possible. So whilst we may be furthering ourown careers in the dissemination process we can do so ethically – by usingdata that draws on community voices but also presents that data in a form thatwill be accepted by those wider structures in society that continue to providemarginalising infrastructures, legislation and attitudinal barriers. At the sametime the process needs to give local people the skills, understanding andknowledge to raise their own voices. Our ethical responsibility is in respect-ing difference, being open about power differentials but trying to avoid ex-ploitation of these differences in a way that will undermine the very peoplewe are trying to help. It is the purpose (participation at all stages with a viewto local empowerment) that should be the focus, and attention to ethical re-sponsibilities (a commitment to methods that are appropriate for purpose, awillingness to listen and recognise local indigenous strengths and abilities)that will achieve new knowledge production and political will (letting go con-trol) that can, in turn, enable grass roots led action for change, but perhaps asa longer term strategy than PA alone can allow.We must be realistic, however. It is highly unlikely that participatory orany other engagement with human beings will produce consensus within anycommunity of different voices. Perhaps the best we can hope for is to start aprocess of deepening understanding and allow the natural course of events toslowly drip feed into an improvement in sensitivities and recognition of thepositive elements of this kind of research. The process, however, has to belinked to wider development initiatives that can build on what PA has started.This, then, is the final justification for participatory appraisal. If participa-tory methodologies provide access to data that is otherwise unavailable, thenit has a part to play in filling the gap in knowledge about disempowermentand poverty production from the perspectives of the least empowered in soci-ety. This holds true for all countries in the world.220 Julia PreeceReferences<ref>Boyde, G. (2000): Village appraisal: is this a case of elegant power?.
