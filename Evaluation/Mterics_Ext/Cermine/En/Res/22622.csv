US$22.95Contemporary power relations implicate animals in complex ways, whichhave yet to be fully appreciated by sociocultural theorists. Like the popularBritish candy after which the book is named, Franklin approaches Dollythe cloned sheep as a novel mixture: at once a living creature, a rich culturalsymbol, a viable example of recombinant biotechnology, a commodity, acyborg, and the outcome of intersecting lineages. With Dolly Mixtures, anethnographic monograph instantiating the “animal turn” in social studiesof health science, Franklin makes a watershed contribution.Dolly Mixtures is a public ethnography, for several key informants havepublished inﬂuential scientiﬁc papers, some of these scientists have becomepublic ﬁgures, and cloning is hotly debated in academic ﬁelds such asbioethics as well in the mass media. Against this backdrop, Franklin musthave faced some daunting challenges in carrying out this project, fromnegotiating access through to writing up. The very public status of Dolly andof the topic of cloning certainly forces Franklin to specify her contribution.She addresses, head-on in the introduction and discreetly throughout inher referencing practices, the role of science writing by socioculturalscholars. Ultimately, Dolly Mixtures exempliﬁes a sort of science writingthat sociocultural scholars can and arguably should aim to do. Perhaps oneof the Franklin’s most important contributions is the deceptively simpleconversational style in which she has written Dolly Mixtures. Deeperdialogue, versus dogmatic debate, is sorely needed to come to grips withshifts in the range of roles played by animals in human lives.Franklin (pp. 9–10) ardently defends society and culture as objects tobe analyzed through material refractions, Dolly being a case in point.Thus, she explicitly rejects several inﬂuential scholars’ directives on howto approach nonhuman entities. She is chieﬂy concerned with elucidatingand demonstrating how, in the course of exerting control over the livesof sheep, people impose or otherwise bring about order in their own livesand in the lives of other people. That is why she adopts “the in some waysvery conservative idiom of genealogy” (p.10).Drawing from cultural studies, anthropology, gender and kinshiptheory, science studies, postcolonial criticism, the history of agriculture,and the history of biology, Franklin foregrounds Dolly so as to investigate133health: 12(1)the intersection between the materiality and representation. Althoughscholarly attention to such entwinings of ‘nature / culture’ has a long history,Franklin’s analysis offers a novel perspective in that she deftly illuminateshow Dolly stems from but also disrupts lineages of capital, nation, empire,and science. In accounting for Dolly’s life and times, Franklin considers thejust-past alongside the longue durée and the emerging present. For whileDolly herself was cloned into existence, domesticated sheep attained theirvarious bodily forms in relation to people’s desires for something warmto wear and for something good to eat, and in relation to imperial desirestoo. Nowadays, the frontiers straddled by animals akin to Dolly includescience and aspirations for longevity. Ultimately, Franklin’s attention togenealogy in context is what makes her analysis so textured, dynamic, andinteresting.Franklin does not offer a problem-and-solution analysis, whether onmoral, political, or economic grounds; rather, similar to Donna Haraway’scontributions to critical theory, she aims to create new critical sensibilitiesthat allow us to make sense of Dolly’s coming into being, and of her passing.Although somatic cell nuclear transfer, the technology central to the Dollytechnique, is both inefﬁcient and expensive, Dolly nonetheless representedan innovation. Franklin shows that animals animate health politics not onlyas disease models, but also as sources of food and therapeutics. The use ofanimals and animal parts to produce therapeutics intended to enter humanbodies is sometimes called pharming, and indeed the products derivedfrom animals include pharmaceuticals. For example, most insulin productsused to treat human diabetics still derive from porcine insulin. As Franklin(p. 195) points out, Dolly was used not as livestock but as lifestock; in otherwords, Dolly was not necessarily a viable agricultural commodity but wasa principle or base biotechnology that helped inaugurate a postgenomicfuture/present rooted in stem cell science and tissue engineering. Thesetechnologies carry transformative implications for agriculture, medicalresearch, and embodiment. These implications are why, Franklin argues,we desperately need new critical language to make sense of Dolly, not tocelebrate ‘Dollymania’ nor to condemn emergent biotechnologies but tounderstand what such ovine-machines imply for future human/nonhumanassociations and collectivities.Dolly Mixtures comprises an introduction followed by ﬁve chaptersand conclusion bearing titles made up of a single word: “Origins,” “Sex,”“Capital,” “Nation,” “Colony,” “Death,” and “Breeds.” One way to readDolly Mixtures is as an analytic reﬂection on how meanings and practiceshave shifted since Raymond Williams’s (1983 [1976]) Keywords was lastrevised. Franklin expressly pays homage to Williams: “The ability of therural farm animal to evoke what Raymond Williams calls ‘whole waysof life and whole ways of struggle’ captures one of the most importantsources of emotional attachment to sheep as embodiments of human labor,industry, and accomplishment” (p. 193). Later, Franklin turns to Williamsfor an epigraph on “production and reproduction” in the concluding134Book Reviewchapter entitled, “Breeds” (p. 195) Keywords contains entries on “Sex,”“Capitalism,” “Nationalist,” and “Imperialism,” but not on origins or ondeath. The absence of entries on “origins” or on “death” or, for that matter,on “life” in Keywords may imply that, over the past 25 years or so, culturalpolitics has come to be more about efforts bent on exerting control overcells, organisms, and entire populations. But if so, Franklin’s focus onDolly gives pause, for Dolly’s body was a nonhuman one, even if createdand shaped in relation to human desires.Not one monograph can ever be said to wholly complete, and as we havealready noted, one of the main contributions that Franklin makes is toinvite rather than foreclose further research, theorizing, and commentary.Franklin (p.. 9–10, 15–16) “sheepishly” owns up to a number of limitations,including this telling comment: “As an astute reader of noted of itsmeandering path and stupefying accumulation of ovine detail, the problemwith following sheep around is that they get everywhere” (p. 8–9).Yet one place Franklin does not tread is scrapie, a disease caused by aninfectious protein (or prion) that afﬂicts sheep. Her inattention to this ovineprion disease is somewhat unfortunate as connections have been drawnbetween scrapie, BSE, and cases of Creuzfeldt Jacob disease in people.(Not long ago, brain and spinal tissue from sheep routinely entered cattlefeed. This practice is now banned in the United Kingdom and in manyother jurisdictions, on the grounds of preventing BSE.) Foot-and-mouthdisease, however, is nicely covered in Dolly Mixtures, Indeed, the “Death”chapter could be read alongside research documenting the recent impactof foot-and-mouth disease (e.g., Mort et al., 2005). As Franklin helps toshow, just because a disease cannot spread from animals to people doesnot mean it cannot affect people.Franklin’s approachable language makes this text suitable for upper-levelundergraduate and graduate-level analysis. She provides much ‘fodder’ forthought, opening avenues for empirically grounded and theoretically astutediscourses to help make sense of contemporary human-animal relations.Following on from some of the pathways that Franklin has highlighted oropened up, we look forward to reading new work on the importance ofanimals for human bodies and for people’s lives.References<ref>Mort, M., Convery, I., Baxter, J. & Bailey, C.
