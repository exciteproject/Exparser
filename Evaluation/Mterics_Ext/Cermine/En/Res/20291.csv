The diagnoses of autism spectrum disorders (ASD)thus seemed to be assigned much later than the time whenparents notice developmental deviances in their child. Inorder to help to identify ASDs, a number of screeninginstruments have been developed, many of them for moreseverely handicapped children with autism [e.g. 4, 5, 13] orfor children with ASD at all intelligence levels [e.g. 7, 8,21]. Additionally, some screening instruments have beendeveloped and validated precisely for higher-functioningphenotypes [e.g. 9, 10, 22, 27].The Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ)[10] was the ﬁrst screening instrument developed preciselyfor AS. Initially it was known as the Asperger SyndromeScreening Questionnaire. The rationale for evaluation of theASSQ in AS and other ASDs in higher-functioning childrenwas the fact that there is a clear overlap of symptoms atbehavioural level, reﬂected in the International Classiﬁca-tion of Mental and Behavioural Disorders (ICD-10, WHO)[28] and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-orders (DSM-IV, APA) [2] criteria for ASDs. Originallydesigned in Sweden in Swedish, the questionnaire wasdeveloped speciﬁcally for teacher screening in childrenaged 7–16 years with normal intelligence or mild mentalretardation. However, the Swedish cut-off scores weredetermined later for both parents’ and teachers’ ratings[9, 10]. The ASSQ has been used in clinical settings inFinland since the 1990s and it has also been translated intoother languages (English [10], Lithuanian [15], Norwegian[19]). No other validated screening instrument especiallyfor AS was available when the ASSQ was imported fromSweden to Finland.In reports on child psychiatric symptoms, agreementbetween parents’ and teachers’ ratings is generally low tomoderate [1, 14]. Agreement between informants has beenstudied not only in general child psychiatric symptoms, butalso in autistic features [19, 24]. Szatmari et al. [24]reported slight agreement between parents’ and teachers’ratings (r = 0.17) in the Autism Behavior Checklist(ABC; [13]) when assessing children with pervasivedevelopmental disorders (PDD). The results were sug-gested to be partly explained by real differences inbehaviour at school and at home. In turn, Posserud et al.[19] reported low-to-moderate agreement between parentsand teachers when assessing autistic features in a totalpopulation of 7–9-year-old children by using the ASSQ. As123Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry (2009) 18:499–509a consequence of low-to-moderate agreement, it is wellgrounded to assume that the number of informants—amulti-informant versus a single-informant approach—mayinﬂuence diagnostics [9, 15, 18, 23]. Because of largedifferences across informants, the need to gather informa-tion from both families and schools when screening forASDs was also suggested by Posserud et al. [19].The purpose of our study was threefold: ﬁrst, to studythe association between parents’ and teachers’ ratings onthe Finnish version of the ASSQ, second, to ﬁnd outwhether the original cut-off scores recommended by Ehlerset al. [10] are able to identify Finnish higher-functioning[full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) C 50] primaryschool-aged children with AS or autism and whether usingmulti-informant ratings could increase the value of theASSQ as a screening instrument, and third, to evaluate thesensitivity, speciﬁcity, positive predictive value (PPV),negative predictive value (NPV), likelihood ratio (LR),per cent agreement (% agreement) and kappa on theFinnish ASSQ.MethodsParticipantsThe participants of this study were drawn from two ongoingstudies concerning higher-functioning (FSIQ C 50) chil-dren with AS or autism: (1) the ‘‘total population study’’[18], consisting of 4,408 children (FSIQ C 50) and (2) the‘‘outpatient study’’ of high-functioning (FSIQ C 80) out-patient children with AS/autism, consisting of 34 children.The participants were then divided into three partly over-lapping groups: (1) ‘‘total population group’’: 4,408 eight-year-old children (mean age 8.3, range 7.8–8.8) from the‘‘total population study’’ including 13 outpatients with ASD(FSIQ C 50), (2) ‘‘validation sample’’: 104 eight-year-oldchildren (mean age 8.3, range 7.8–8.8) from the ‘‘totalpopulation study’’ including the 13 outpatients mentionedabove with ASD (FSIQ C 50) and (3) ‘‘outpatient group’’:47 outpatient children aged 7–12 (mean age 9.7, range7.7–12.2) with ASD (FSIQ C 50) from Oulu UniversityHospital (n = 43) or at Tahkokangas Service Centre inOulu (i.e. a rehabilitation centre for mentally handicapped,n = 4) including the above-mentioned 13 outpatients withASD from the ‘‘total population study’’.In Finland, compulsory education offers equal educa-tional possibilities for every child aged 7–16 years. Fromthe age of 7 to the age of 12, children attend primaryschool, and from 13 to 16 years they attend secondaryschool. All children undergo developmental examinationsin children’s health care centres several times before schoolage. If any developmental deviances are found or mentalEur Child Adolesc Psychiatry (2009) 18:499–509retardation is suspected, the child is referred to moredetailed investigations and school readiness examinationsalso including the determination of IQ. Parents thus get toknow the cognitive level of their child. If mental retarda-tion is assigned, the child is referred to prolonged com-pulsory education and further service (at TahkokangasService Centre in the Oulu University Hospital area).Registered ASD diagnosesOf the 47 ASD outpatients in this study, 32 had the reg-istered diagnosis of AS, 3 had infantile autism with mildmental retardation, whereas 11 had ‘‘AS traits’’ and 1 had‘‘autistic traits’’ with mild mental retardation in the recordsof the Oulu University Hospital and/or Tahkokangas Ser-vice Centre. AS and AS traits diagnoses had been assignedbased on the ICD-10 criteria regarding current behaviour.Thus, a differential diagnosis between AS and high-func-tioning autism (HFA) had not been made. The diagnosis‘‘AS traits’’ refers to the features of AS, and ‘‘autistictraits’’ to the features of autism.ProcedureThe studies were approved by the ethical committee ofOulu University Hospital. The school inspector, thesuperintendents of all 43 municipalities and all 329 school501principals were informed and permission was asked tocarry out the screening phase of the ‘‘total populationstudy’’. Written informed consent was obtained from par-ents and from children aged 12–13 years.Total population studyScreening phase of the studyThe ‘‘total population study’’ started in September 2000 inthe Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital District area [18](Fig. 1). All 8-year-old children born in 1992 attendingprimary or special school and living in this area in autumn2000 were chosen for the target population, n = 5,484(Statistics Finland, 31st of December, 2000). The teachersof these children were given an information package con-cerning the study, including lectures on AS and the ASSQ,after which the questionnaires were distributed to parentsby teachers. The parents were required to provide a writteninformed consent to participate in the study and were askedto complete the ASSQ and a developmental questionnaire,in which possible AS and autism diagnosis and possiblemental retardation were asked about. In the case of mentalretardation, the level (mild, moderate, severe or profound)was also inquired in the developmental questionnaire.Parent questionnaires were returned to teachers in closedenvelopes with written permission to participate on theFig. 1 Study design and subject ﬂow.

Parents of 4,424 children (80.7%) gave permission.After permission from parents the teachers of these chil-dren completed the ASSQ. The teachers were also askedabout the child’s curriculum: general or special needseducation (i.e. partly or completely adjusted education oreducation for children with mild, moderate, severe orprofound mental retardation, or any other special educa-tion). Finally, the teachers returned all questionnaires to theresearchers. Based on parents’ reports on the level ofmental retardation with complementary curriculum infor-mation from teachers, eight children were excluded ashaving moderate or severe mental retardation. A total of4,416 children remained in the study.Missing dataOf these 4,416 children, 660 did not have parents’, 26teachers’ and two did not have either parents’ or teachers’ratings, and 183 parents’ ASSQs were discarded due tomissing information (i.e. 1–25 items were missing). Miss-ing items in teachers’ ASSQs were asked either by regularmail or by telephone, and all teachers’ ASSQs werethus successfully completed. Eventually, 4,414 childrenremained, with 3,571 parents’ and 4,388 teachers’ ASSQs.‘‘Validation sample’’ for ASSQ validity evaluationsOf the 4,414 children, 125 were included in the ‘‘validationsample’’ in which the ASSQ validity was evaluated. Thesample of 125 children consisted of all 73 screening-posi-tive (parent ASSQ C 19 and/or teacher ASSQ C 22; [10])children and a sample of 52 screening-negative children. Ofthe 73 screening-positive children, 24 were screening-positive only in parents’, 36 only in teachers’ and 13 in bothratings. The inclusion criteria of screening-negative chil-dren were based on two Swedish articles [10, 12]: teacherASSQ 17-21 (n = 28) [12]; parent ASSQ 7-18 and teacherASSQ 9-16 (n = 24) [10]; these minimum scores, parentASSQ score of 7 and teacher ASSQ score of 9, wereselected from the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)curves in the study of Ehlers et al. [10] with sensitivity of95%. Of the 125 children, 110 (88.0%) agreed to proceed,65 of whom were screening-positive (89.0%) and 45screening-negative (86.5%). Thus, 15 children declined,two of whom with AS/AS traits diagnosis according to theparents’ developmental questionnaire.To ﬁnd out the outpatients with registered ASD diagnosisin the ‘‘validation sample’’, developmental history ques-tionnaires completed by parents and patient records at theUniversity Hospital of Oulu and Tahkokangas ServiceCentre were studied. Permission to check the patient recordswas asked from the parents. Of these 110 children, 18 wereoutpatients with ASD diagnosis (4 AS, 6 AS traits, 1 AS123Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry (2009) 18:499–509suspected, 1 HFA, 3 autism with mild mental retardation, 1autismus infantilis, 1 PDD with mild mental retardation, and1 autistic traits with mild mental retardation).Diagnostic re-assignmentsThese 18 outpatients with registered ASD diagnosis under-went diagnostic examinations. The Autism DiagnosticInterview-Revised (ADI-R; [16]), as a structured develop-mental and symptom history from parent(s), and the AutismDiagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS; [17]), module 3,as a semi-structured child observation, were administeredand videotaped by a paediatrician (M.-L.M.), clinicallyexperienced in ASDs, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scalefor Children-Third Revision (WISC-III) [25] was adminis-tered by two psychologists. Parents were also asked tosupplement incompletely completed ASSQs (n = 1; fouritems missing) or fulﬁl non-completed ASSQs (n = 3).Three screening-positive outpatients with ASD werenow tested as having an FSIQ below 50, and they wereexcluded, leaving 15 outpatients with ASD for further re-evaluations. In the ‘‘validation sample’’, the WISC-III wasadministered to three children without any registered ASDdiagnosis to ﬁnd out the accurate FSIQ level. Onescreening-positive child had earlier been diagnosed to havemild/moderate mental retardation; the FSIQ of that childwas now determined as below 50. Two screening-negativehad severe neurological disability and the previous IQ levelwas unsure; these two still could not be tested reliably. Allthree children were excluded from the study.After diagnostic examinations, school day observationsof ﬁve children were undertaken to obtain more informa-tion. The observations were performed by an autismresearcher of our team, a Master of Education (M.K.) blindto the primary examinations. The observation of each childlasted an entire school day, including direct observationduring lessons and breaks, ‘‘structured interview’’ (ASSQ)and non-structured discussion with the teacher. After that,re-evaluations of 15 outpatients with ASD were performedby experienced clinicians (S.-L.L. and M.-L.M.) byreviewing all available data (ADI-R, ADOS tapes, ASSQs,patient records and school day observations). M.K. par-ticipated in the re-evaluation meetings for the ﬁve childrenwhose school day was observed. The ICD-10 researchcriteria were then fulﬁlled, item by item, based on theconsensus between S.-L.L. and M.-L.M. Two outpatientswith ASD (one AS traits and one AS suspected) did notmeet the ICD-10 research criteria for AS or autism. Finally,13 were re-assigned as ASD, 5 of them as AS, 6 as HFA,and 2 as autism with mild mental retardation. Six of the 13outpatients with re-assigned ASD were registered as ASDin hospital patient records after parent and teacher ASSQratings (i.e. after the screening phase of our study).Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry (2009) 18:499–509Final groups in the ‘‘total population study’’Assessment instruments503Eventually, 4,408 (80.4%) children with ASSQ made upthe ‘‘total population group’’, including 3,565 (80.9%)parents’ ASSQs, and 4,382 (99.4%) teachers’ ASSQs,3,539 of which (80.3%) rated by both, all of the childrenhaving an FSIQ C 50 and no items missing on the ASSQs.In addition, of the 4,408 children, 61 screening-positiveand 43 screening-negative made up a ‘‘validation sample’’(n = 104), all rated by parents and 103 by teachers,including 13 outpatients with registered and veriﬁed ASD.The ASSQ validation was to be evaluated in the ‘‘valida-tion sample’’.Outpatient studyThe ‘‘outpatient study’’ started in January 2003 and is partof a larger research project concerning high-functioning(FSIQ C 80) outpatient children with AS or autism of OuluUniversity Hospital (Fig. 1). All 7–12-year-old primaryschool-aged outpatients with AS or AS traits, excludingoutpatients born in 1992 (i.e. the outpatients already in the‘‘total population study’’), were invited (n = 38), and 34(89.5%) participated. All parents completed the ASSQ.The ASD diagnoses of 34 outpatients were re-assigned byusing the ADI-R [16] to acquire developmental and symp-tom history from parent(s), and by using the ADOS, module3 [17] to observe the child’s behaviour and communicationskills. The examinations were administered and videotapedby a research psychologist (K.J.). The patient records of allparticipants were studied. The diagnoses were then rede-ﬁned according to the ICD-10 research criteria, based oninformation obtained with the ADI-R, ADOS and frompatient records, by a psychologist (K.J.) consulting anexperienced clinician (M.-L.M.) when a second opinion wasneeded. Development in the ﬁrst 3 years of life was nowtaken into account. In these evaluations 21 children met theICD-10 research criteria for AS and 13 for autism.The teachers of all 34 children were asked to completethe ASSQ 1 year later. Questionnaires were sent by regularmail to the parents, who were asked to complete the con-sent and then give the questionnaire to their child’s teacher.The questionnaire was resent twice if the ASSQ was notreturned by the teacher. One 12-year-old child did not givepermission to the teacher to complete the ASSQ. Finally,33 teachers completed the ASSQ with parents’ (andchild’s) permission.Eventually, the ‘‘outpatient group’’ consisted of 47children (13 from the ‘‘total population study’’ and 34 fromthe ‘‘outpatient study’’), 26 of whom met the re-assigneddiagnosis for AS, 19 for HFA and 2 for autism with mildmental retardation. The ASSQ was completed by all par-ents and by 46 teachers.Autism Spectrum Screening QuestionnaireThe ASSQ [10] comprises 27 items rated on a 3-pointscale, 0 indicating normal, 1 some abnormality and 2deﬁnite abnormality. The range of score is 0–54. Elevenitems tap topics regarding social interaction, six covercommunication problems and ﬁve refer to restricted andrepetitive behaviour. The remaining ﬁve items embracemotor clumsiness and other associated symptoms includingmotor and vocal tics. Completing the ASSQ takes 10 min.Cut-off scores of 19 or more for parents’ and 22 or morefor teachers’ ratings have been recommended in Swedenfor screening to identify ASDs in children with normalintelligence or mild mental retardation in a clinical setting[9, 10]. The content and concurrent and discriminatingvalidity of the questionnaire have been studied, and it hasbeen published by Ehlers et al. [10].The ASSQ was ﬁrst translated into Finnish by twoclinically experienced psychologists and then back-trans-lated into Swedish by an ofﬁcial Swedish translator. Theﬁnal version was completed based on comparison betweenthe original and the back-translated Swedish forms by theauthors and on comments by child neurologists at OuluUniversity Hospital. On the 3-point scale, we decided toexclude the word ‘‘deﬁnite’’ from the alternative ‘‘deﬁniteabnormality’’ in the Finnish version because of clinicalexperience of Finnish parents’ reluctance to assess theirchildren’s features as ‘‘deﬁnite’’.Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and AutismDiagnostic Observation ScheduleThe ADI-R [16] is a standardized investigator-based parentinterview developed to elicit a full range of informationacross all three main symptom areas needed to produce adiagnosis of autism and to assist in the assessment ofrelated PDDs. The ADI-R was translated into Finnish bytwo clinical psychologists in the 1990s and then back-translated into English by an ofﬁcial English translator.After comparison the ﬁnal Finnish version was completedby a group of professionals in the ﬁeld of ASDs, all trainedin the use of the ADI-R.The ADOS [17] is a semi-structured assessment ofsocial interaction, communication and play or imaginativeuse of materials for individuals who may have autism orother PDDs. The ADOS comprises four modules based onthe verbal level of the subject. Module 3 was used in thisstudy and was translated into Finnish by an ofﬁcial Englishtranslator.The physicians (M.-L.M. and S.-L.L.), psychologist(K.J.) and Master of Education (M.K.) who participated in123504the diagnostic process have been trained in the use of theADI-R and ADOS for research purposes. The cut-offscores of the algorithms are standardized for autism andASDs, but there are no algorithms precisely for AS. TheADI-R and ADOS algorithms were not used in this study.Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third RevisionIQ was measured by the WISC-III [25]. Throughout thisstudy, the diagnosis of ‘‘HFA’’ is used in subjects withautism who had an FSIQ C 70, and the FSIQ of ‘‘higher-functioning’’ subjects is deﬁned to be C50.Patient recordsThe University Hospital of Oulu and/or TahkokangasService Centre records of the subjects in the ‘‘validationsample’’ and in the ‘‘outpatient group’’ were studied. Earlydevelopment was veriﬁed.Statistical analysesThe distributions of total ASSQ scores were skewed in the‘‘total population group’’, while total ASSQ scores werenormally distributed in the ‘‘validation sample’’ and in the‘‘outpatient group’’. In skewed distributed data and in smallsamples, non-parametric Mann–Whitney’s U-test (Z) andWilcoxon’s test were used. In normally distributed data,analyses were performed by parametric t-test for twoindependent samples and paired t-test. Correlationsbetween parents’ and teachers’ ratings were estimatedusing Spearman’s rho in skewed distributed data and insmall samples, and Pearson correlation in normally dis-tributed data. Correlations’ P-values are reported as one-sided and others’ as two-sided. P-values \ 0.05 wereinterpreted as signiﬁcant. ROC analyses were performed toassess the discriminating validity of the ASSQ. Analyseswere produced with the Statistical Package for SocialSciences version 16.0 for Windows.ResultsMedians and means in ratings and differencesbetween ratingsThe median in parents’ ratings was 24.0 (n = 47) and inteachers’ ratings was 27.5 (n = 46) in the ‘‘outpatientgroup’’; the corresponding ﬁgures were 1.0 (n = 3,565)and 0.0 (n = 4,382) in the ‘‘total population group’’. Meandifferences between ‘‘outpatient group’’ and ‘‘total popu-lation group’’ in parents’ (M = 24.3 vs. 2.0; P \ 0.001)and teachers’ ratings (M = 27.2 vs. 1.5; P \ 0.001) were123Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry (2009) 18:499–509signiﬁcant. In the ‘‘total population group’’, mean interraterdifference between parent and teacher scorings was 0.4(M = 2.0 vs. 1.6; Z = -11.209; n = 3.539; P \ 0.001),and in the ‘‘validation sample’’, -5.8 (M = 12.2 vs. 18.0;95% conﬁdence interval [CI] -8.7 to -3.0; n = 103;P \ 0.001). The mean difference for parents’ scores inthe ‘‘outpatient group’’ between the subjects (n = 6)rated before and the ones (n = 41) rated after gettingoutpatient ASD diagnosis was signiﬁcant (M = 18.0 vs.25.2; Z = -1.963; P = 0.049) (Table 1).In the ‘‘outpatient group’’, means between males andfemales did not differ signiﬁcantly in parents’ (M = 23.7vs. 26.2) and teachers’ (M = 26.6 vs. 29.2) ratings,whereas in the ‘‘total population group’’, males were ratedsigniﬁcantly higher than females by parents (M = 2.3 vs.1.7; Z = -4.219; P \ 0.001) and by teachers (M = 2.2 vs.0.9; Z = -8.568; P \ 0.001) (Table 1).

In turn, corre-lation coefﬁcient between parents’ and teachers’ ratingswas negative in the ‘‘validation sample’’ (r = -0.368,P \ 0.001) (Fig. 3), and it was also negative in high-scoring children (n = 42; parent ASSQ C 7 or teacherASSQ C 9) from the 14 schools where teachers wereknown not to participate in the lectures on AS and theASSQ (r = -0.421, P = 0.003).Participants scoring at or above the original cut-offscores in the ‘‘outpatient group’’Of the ‘‘outpatient group’’, mainly rated at the interval of1 year, 81.1% of parents’ (n = 37), 72.2% of teachers’(n = 36) and 97.3% of either parents’ or teachers’ ratings(n = 37) were at or above the original cut-offs of theASSQ (parents C 19, teachers C 22) [10], and only onesubject fell below both cut-offs (18 from mother and 13from teacher). Ratings were also analysed separately in thegroup of ten children with AS/autism from the ‘‘outpatientgroup’’, rated at the same time by both informants: 60.0%of parents’, 80.0% of teachers’ and 90.0% of either parents’or teachers’ ratings were at or above the original cut-offsEur Child Adolesc Psychiatry (2009) 18:499–509Table 1 Means of total ASSQ scores and differences between totalASSQ scoresnM (SD)RangeTotal population groupAllParents1Teachers2MalesParents3Teachers4FemalesParents3Teachers4Outpatient groupAllParents1Teachers2MalesParents5Teachers6FemalesParents5Teachers6ParentsBefore outpatient ASD diagnosis7After outpatient ASD diagnosis73,5654,3821,7442,1611,8212,2214746373610106412.0 (3.5)1.5 (3.9)2.3 (3.9)2.2 (4.7)1.7 (3.0)0.9 (2.8)24.3 (8.5)27.2 (9.5)23.7 (7.9)26.6 (8.8)26.2 (10.8)29.2 (12.0)18.0 (7.0)25.2 (8.4)0–300–490–300–490–280–438–404–438–384–4310–4013–438–268–40ASSQ Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire1 P \ 0.001 for parents’ ratings between ‘‘total population group’’and ‘‘outpatient group’’2 P \ 0.001 for teachers’ ratings between ‘‘total population group’’and ‘‘outpatient group’’3 P \ 0.001 for parents’ ratings between males and females in ‘‘totalpopulation group’’4 P \ 0.001 for teachers’ ratings between males and females in‘‘total population group’’5 P = ns. for parents’ ratings between males and females in ‘‘out-patient group’’6 P = ns. for teachers’ ratings between males and females in‘‘outpatient group’’7 P = 0.049 for parents’ ratings between children rated beforeoutpatient ASD diagnosis and after outpatient ASD diagnosis in‘‘outpatient group’’and only one subject fell below the cut-off scores (11 frommother and 19 from teacher).ASSQ validation in the ‘‘validation sample’’Discriminant validity was studied using the ROC analysesfor ASSQ scores of parents, teachers and summed scores ofparents and teacher in the ‘‘validation sample’’.

However, the cut-off of 30 with sensitivity of 1.00and speciﬁcity of 0.73 was the best estimation for summedscores of parents and teacher. For the teacher cut-off of 22,PPV was 0.28, NPV 0.97, LR 2.72, % agreement 70.9 andkappa 0.29 (95% CI: 0.05–0.52).

The medians andmeans of the ASSQ scores in parents’ and teachers’ ratingswere signiﬁcantly higher in children with AS/autism(‘‘outpatient group’’) than in the total population (‘‘totalpopulation group’’). In addition, parents scored childrenwho were rated on the ASSQ in our study after receivingASD diagnosis at the outpatient clinic signiﬁcantly higherthan children who were rated on the ASSQ in our studybefore receiving ASD diagnosis at the outpatient clinic.This might indicate that parents of the children who were123Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry (2009) 18:499–509already diagnosed as ASD at the outpatient clinic probablyknew better what kind of features they had to assess,leading them to rate their children higher, or that theyalready knew what was causing their children’s symptomsand they were more educated to perceive certain symptomstypical of ASD. Based on this discovery, it may beassumed that parents might score lower on the ASSQ atdiagnostic examinations in clinical settings, because theyusually do not know very much about ASDs when theirchild is referred to the outpatient clinic. After the child hasbeen diagnosed with ASD parents obtain knowledge aboutASDs, and they might score higher on the ASSQ. How-ever, the number of subjects (n = 6) who were not diag-nosed as ASD before ASSQ ratings was low. Therefore, theeffect of parents’ awareness of diagnosis on their scoringshould be analysed in larger samples. The teachers’ scoreswere at the same level irrespective of whether the outpa-tient ASD diagnoses were already given or not. However,we did not know who of the teachers were aware of theoutpatient ASD diagnosis.No crucial score difference between genders was foundin the ‘‘outpatient group’’. However, reliable conclusionabout the gender non-differences in higher-functioningsubjects with ASD has to be treated with prudence becauseof the wide score ranges and the small number of femalesin the ‘‘outpatient group’’ (n = 10). Baron-Cohen et al. [6]also reported that male and female scores (on the AutismSpectrum Quotient; AQ) did not differ signiﬁcantly amongthe AS/HFA group; however, the number of females(n = 13) was also small in their study. In turn, in the ‘‘totalpopulation group’’ males were rated signiﬁcantly higherthan females by both parents and teachers, which lendssupport to the assumption that females are more competentin their social skills than males [6, 26]. There is a clearoverlap of symptoms at the behavioural level betweenchildren with AS and other high-functioning children withASD based on the ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria for ASDs.No signiﬁcant ASSQ score difference was found betweenthe children with AS and HFA (Fig. 2), showing that dif-ferential diagnosis between AS and HFA cannot be madeby using the ASSQ.In Finland, primary school teachers get to know theirpupils and their behaviour well, because there is one mainteacher for each class group who teaches the same pupils formany hours every day from one to several years. Thus, it canbe assumed that both parents and teachers know thebehaviour of the children quite well, which might haveyielded high concordance in the ratings. However, agree-ment between informants was slight (r = 0.207), and evennegative correlation (r = -0.368) was found between par-ents’ and teachers’ ratings in the higher scoring ‘‘validationsample’’. This might indicate that the differences in behav-iour between home and school are real.

As described, the teacherswere given an information package concerning the study,including lectures on AS and the ASSQ. By receivinginformation, the teachers may have been better aware thanparents as to what kind of features they were supposed toassess. This might skew the correlation between informantsin the ‘‘total population group’’. In Oulu, the biggestmunicipality of this study and the capital of NorthernOstrobothnia, we were able to obtain the information thatteachers from 14 schools did not took in the lectures on ASand the ASSQ. However, in spite of the fact that theseteachers were not trained, agreement between informantswas slight (0.097), and in high-scoring ASSQs (parent C 7,or teacher C 9), correlation was negative (r = -0.421)between parents’ and teachers’ ratings, being in concor-dance with the results of the high-scoring ‘‘validation sam-ple’’. In contrast, Swedish and Norwegian researchers havereported a stronger association between parents’ andteachers’ ratings on the ASSQ. Ehlers et al. [10] reportedmarked interrater reliability (Pearson r = 0.66) of the ASSQmean total score for parents’ and teachers’ ratings in chil-dren (n = 105) who were consecutively referred to the childneuropsychiatric clinic, and the correlation across infor-mants for children with ASD (n = 20) was also marked(r = 0.77) in their study. In turn, Posserud et al. [19]reported a moderate correlation of 0.48 between teacher andparent score for boys and a low correlation of 0.34 betweeninformants for girls on the ASSQ in a population sample of9,430 children. For the whole, scale agreement betweenparents and teachers was 0.40 (weighted kappa) in the studyof Posserud et al. [19].The ﬁrst stage of the ASSQ validation was to ﬁnd outwhether the original cut-offs are workable in the ‘‘outpa-tient group’’. Our results showed that only two subjectswith ASD fell below the original parent and teacher cut-offs (parent ASSQ \ 19, teacher ASSQ \ 22). In addition,none of the outpatient children with ASD were rated belowboth minimum scores with 95% sensitivity based on theROC curves in the study of Ehlers et al. [10] (parentASSQ \ 7, teacher ASSQ \ 9).After the ﬁrst stage of the ASSQ validation, we pro-ceeded to the second phase to evaluate the statistics ofthe ASSQ. For this reason, all potential children with ASD[10, 12] were selected from the ‘‘total population study’’to make up a ‘‘validation sample’’ in which the ASSQvalidation was evaluated. Generalizations of the validityﬁndings might be limited to the clinical settings whendiagnosing higher-functioning patients who are suspectedto have AS or autism. Generalization to whole populationscreening has to be treated with caution because the‘‘validation sample’’ was not selected randomly. We gaveup random selection because of the low number of ASDdiagnoses in total population [e.g. 3, 23].Based on our results, the use of the original Swedish cut-off of 22 [10] with 85% sensitivity and 69% speciﬁcity forteacher ASSQ score is indicated in Finland as well.In contrast, Ehlers et al. [10] reported poorer sensitivity123508(65–70%) and better speciﬁcity (91%) for the teachercut-off score of 22. However, according to our results theASSQ seems to work best by using a summed parents’ andteacher’s score. In clinical settings, it is important to screenall potential ASD subjects. Thus, the cut-off score of 30 forthe summed parents’ and teacher’s score is recommendedto be used in clinical settings with 100% sensitivity and73% speciﬁcity. Ehlers et al. [10] estimated the cut-offscore of 19 for parents’ ratings with the sensitivity of62–82% and the speciﬁcity of 90%. Importantly, in Finlandthe ASSQ seemed to be invalid in identifying subjects withAS/autism, if single rating by parents was used: if sensi-tivity was high, speciﬁcity was low, and vice versa. Thus,there is a strong caution against the use of single ASSQrating by parents when screening higher-functioning chil-dren with suspected AS/autism.This study showed that the Finnish ASSQ works as ascreening instrument with some limitations. The ASSQidentiﬁes the majority of higher-functioning children withAS/autism by using the summed parents’ and teacher’s scoreor by using single rating by teacher. NPVs (1.00; 0.97) wereexcellent, showing that no children with AS/autism fellbelow the cut-offs in summed parents’ and teacher’s ratingsand only few children in single ratings by teacher; i.e. it isunlikely that a child has AS/autism if rated below the cut-offscores in summed parents’ and teacher’s or in single tea-cher’s rating. However, PPVs (0.35; 0.28) were very low,indicating that many subjects without a registered AS orautism diagnosis were rated above the cut-offs in summedparents’ and teacher’s ratings and in single teacher’s ratings.In turn, Ehlers et al. [10] did not report any PPV or NPVvalues in their study. Our validation ﬁndings are preliminary;research is ongoing and more results are expected later.ConclusionsFirst, because of the low PPV it is emphasized that theASSQ is a screening instrument, not a diagnostic instru-ment; all screening-positive children have to undergodiagnostic examinations.Second, this article points out the importance of usingmultiple informants, as also suggested by previous studiesconcerning ASDs [e.g. 3, 18–20, 24]. Although the cut-offscore could not be estimated for single parent ratings, thecut-off score for summed parents’ and teacher’s ratingsturned out to be the best.Acknowledgments We want to thank the children and their parents,the teachers and the entire staff of the schools for participating in thisstudy.
