Whilst these can provide useful feedback, theirfocus is likely to reﬂect the values and norms of those commissioningand undertaking the evaluation. For real improvements in quality tooccur both lecturers’ and students’ perspectives of factors that areimportant need to be made explicit and understood. Drawing uponliterature relating to service quality and in particular the ServiceTemplate, this article outlines and evaluates an alternative approach forestablishing students’ and lecturers’ perspectives, obtaining feedbackand developing an agenda for improvement. Using the example ofdissertation supervision, it is argued that a revised Template Processoperating within a process consultation framework can meet theseconcerns. The article concludes with a discussion of the applicabilityof the Template Process to evaluating teaching and learning.K E Y WO R D S : e va l u a t i o n , p r o c e s s c o n s u l t a t i o n , q u a l i t y, s t u d e n t sa n d l e c t u r e r s, Te m p l a t e P r o c e s sIntroductionStudent involvement in evaluation of modules is well recognized as acornerstone of quality improvement in higher education (Hendry et al.,2001). However, despite the attention devoted to evaluation and review, formany students and lecturers the process of feedback is conﬁned to someform of survey designed to assess a range of pre-determined constructs and6006 ALH 049944 (to/d) 3/2/05 2:06 pm Page 61S AU N D E R S & W I L L I A M S : A N A G E N D A F O R Q U A L I T Y I M P R OV E M E N Tadministered at the end of a module. Whilst such surveys can provide usefulfeedback to lecturers, this raises a number of issues. These relate to the focusof data collection, and in particular the extent to which questions askedreﬂect the norms and values of both students and lecturers (Harvey, 1998),the low response rate to such surveys and the commitment of lecturers touse the ﬁndings to improve quality and the learning experience for students(Bingham and Ottewill, 2001).Research exploring the quality review process has included workdrawing upon the service quality literature, arguing that provision of highereducation programmes can be equated to the provision of a service(Cuthbert, 1996). Whilst acknowledging that equating students tocustomers is open to debate, it can be argued that, by engaging in highereducation, students are participating in and paying for a service. Conse-quently, evaluation and review of quality should reﬂect the dyadic natureof such service-type relationships (Rosen and Suprenant, 1998) incorpo-rating the views of both students as users and lecturers as deliverers. Ittherefore follows that, if meaningful improvements are to occur, bothstudents’ and lecturers’ perspectives on those factors that are important andtheir views on the quality of each need to be made explicit. These poten-tially differing perspectives need to be understood by lecturers if they areto go beyond addressing surface concerns relating to quality of learning.In this article, we draw upon developments in service quality to proposean alternative approach to evaluation of the student experience. Followingan overview of traditional measures of service quality and their short-comings in relation to evaluation and review, Staughton and Williams’(1994) Service Template is evaluated as an alternative. Drawing upon this,developments to the process are described, which allow the views ofstudents and lecturers to be captured separately and enable them to beexplored and understood, prior to developing an agenda for action. Theapplication of this process is illustrated, using a case study of the super-vision of undergraduate dissertations at a new university business school.We conclude with a discussion of merits and shortcomings of the process.Measuring qualityWithin service quality literature, the most widely used and debated tool isSERVQUAL, a generic instrument developed to measure service quality(Parasuraman et al., 1991). This instrument and its derivatives have focusedon measurement of the gap between service users’ perceptions and expec-tations across a series of constructs that characterize a service. Notwith-standing shortcomings of conceptualizing service quality in this manner,recognized in the SERVQUAL debates (for example Carmen, 1990; Cronin6106 ALH 049944 (to/d) 3/2/05 2:06 pm Page 62A C T I V E L E A R N I N G I N H I G H E R E D U C A T I O N 6(1)and Taylor, 1992), the use of a disconﬁrmation approach to highlight ‘gaps’between perceptions and expectations and indicate possible areas forimprovement is reported widely in the literature (for example: Parasuraman,1995; Cuthbert, 1996; Narasimhan, 1997). Constructs where service users’perceptions do not meet expectations suggest areas for improvement.Constructs where users’ perceptions equal or exceed expectations imply thatthere is no requirement for improvement, or that more may be being donethan necessary. However, implicit within this is an assumption that datacollected against generic dimensions can capture what is important about aparticular service.Research by Carmen (1990) highlights that the constructs used to char-acterize service quality are likely to be speciﬁc to a service and the industrywithin which it is located, a view echoed in respect of higher education(for example Cuthbert, 1996; Narasimhan, 1997). They and others arguethat the use of generic constructs to measure service quality does notprovide the details necessary to assess the quality of higher educationrelationships. Such relationships are considered more complex than thoseof other services such as a shop or restaurant. For example, they are moreintense, last longer and contain considerable variety at both course andmodule levels. In addition, generic constructs may fail to capture theuniqueness of speciﬁc modules and be understood and interpreted differ-ently by students and lecturers.Traditional approaches such as questionnaires can, with careful design,minimize shortcomings associated with generic constructs and be used toexplore gaps between perceptions and expectations. However, these oftenreﬂect the values, assumptions and issues that are important to their design-ers, which may not correspond to those of the students (Chapple andMurphy, 1996). Alternatively, standardized questionnaires make assump-tions about the appropriateness of generic constructs across a range ofdifferent teaching and learning experiences (Narasimhan, 1997). Further-more, the data collected may not provide clear indications of the actionnecessary to improve quality (Hendry et al., 2001).The approaches outlined so far typically assess quality from only thestudents’ perspective, failing to acknowledge the value of the lecturer’sperspective in a dyadic service-type relationship. The logic underpinningthe ‘gaps’ model (Parasuraman et al., 1985) provides further support forsuch an approach, as there may well be differences in that which isconsidered important by students and lecturers and their perceptions andexpectations. Problems of second order interpretation can occur when datacollected are subject to interpretation by a third party as part of reviewprocess, raising doubts about the validity and completeness of such data. Alecturer undertaking a module evaluation may have ﬁltered and added her6206 ALH 049944 (to/d) 3/2/05 2:06 pm Page 63S AU N D E R S & W I L L I A M S : A N A G E N D A F O R Q U A L I T Y I M P R OV E M E N Tor his own understanding to the language used and emphases placed bystudents.Constructs used to evaluate quality in higher education therefore needto capture the realities separately for students and lecturers. If theseconstructs are to be of real beneﬁt, they must be understood and interpretedby those responsible for improving quality in relation to the norms andvalues of those who generated them. Therefore, a process leading to aninformed evaluation of quality should enable students and lecturers to makeexplicit, independently, their own ideas of those characteristics of teachingand learning that are important. Furthermore, students and lecturers needto be able to highlight, deﬁne and record independently any gaps betweentheir perceptions and expectations. Finally, those responsible for improvingquality have to be able to gain a critical understanding of both students’and lecturers’ perceptions and expectations of the important constructs andany gaps between them.The Template ProcessStaughton and Williams’ (1994) Service Template offers one approach toaddress such concerns. This was developed to illustrate the ‘ﬁt’ between theservice provided and that service’s users’ needs. The approach acknow-ledged the uniqueness of each speciﬁc service, allowing those constructs(characteristics) that users believed were important to be deﬁned and gapsbetween perceptions and expectations to be highlighted and recordedvisually. Each characteristic was deﬁned by service users in terminologyspeciﬁc to the service. As part of this, users speciﬁed positive and negativedescriptors for the extremes of a continuum for each characteristic. Forexample, the characteristic ‘staff appearance’ has been deﬁned through theextremes of ‘smart’ and ‘scruffy’. Subsequently, these users’ perceptions andexpectations for each characteristic were located upon its continuum, gapsbetween perceptions and expectations highlighting where action might beneeded. However, by focusing on users, deliverers’ perceptions and expec-tations were excluded, thereby not reﬂecting the dyadic nature of suchrelationships.Subsequent development of the Service Template Process (Williams et al.,1999) partially addressed this shortcoming. Users and deliverers wereselected using purposive samples based upon cases that were critical to theservice, their quality perceptions and expectations being captured separately.Each resulting Service Template therefore reﬂected the language, terminol-ogy and priorities speciﬁc to either service users or deliverers. However,there was still a need to develop the process to enable those charged withimproving quality to take ownership of the evaluation ﬁndings.6306 ALH 049944 (to/d) 3/2/05 2:06 pm Page 64A C T I V E L E A R N I N G I N H I G H E R E D U C A T I O N 6(1)Organizational development research, and in particular that by Schein(1999), highlights the importance of problem ownership for thosedeveloping meaningful solutions. Schein also emphasizes the signiﬁcanceof process, often managed by a facilitator, to enable insights by all thoseinvolved. Thus, using a development of the Service Template Process withina process consultation framework might allow users and deliverers to worktogether to improve quality by jointly developing an agenda for action.Through a series of process consultations with seven UK based organiz-ations, drawn from public and private sectors, the process was revised andextended to enable this (Saunders and Williams, 2001). The resultantTemplate Process is structured around three phases:Phase I: Sample selectionPurposive samples are drawn from both students (users) and lecturers(deliverers), focusing upon obtaining critical cases from which logicalgeneralizations may be made regarding the key themes. Thus, whilst thesamples are not statistically representative, they capture the diversity andkey dimensions of the service.Phase II: Template generation and validationSeparate meetings, approximately two hours long, are held by a facilitatorfor between six and ten students and lecturers. Each meeting follows aprocess derived from the four stages of the Service Template Process(Williams et al., 1999):Stage 1: Preparation The purpose and nature of the process isexplained and meanings of terms clariﬁed. The situation to be considered,for example dissertation supervision, is displayed prominently and referredto regularly to help maintain focus.Stage 2: Explore service characteristics The characteristics of thissituation are elicited and recorded in the order they emerge using the partici-pants’ words through a brainstorming type process. Clariﬁcation of meaningsis sought; thereby helping ensure everyone in a meeting is using a similarframe of reference and has the same understanding. Subsequently, the list ofcharacteristics is reﬁned and descriptors generated for the extremes of each.For these, participants are asked to suggest the ‘ideal’ situation and the ‘worst’case, the resulting bi-polar rating scales deﬁning these extremes.Stage 3: Plot perceptions and expectations against identiﬁedcharacteristics A visual representation (template) is built by record-ing ﬁrst the expectations and then the perceptions for each characteristic6406 ALH 049944 (to/d) 3/2/05 2:06 pm Page 65S AU N D E R S & W I L L I A M S : A N A G E N D A F O R Q U A L I T Y I M P R OV E M E N Trelative to the extremes on a 10-point scale (see Figures 1 and 2). For eachcharacteristic, perceptions are deﬁned through answers to the question‘What do you perceive to be the position today?’ and expectations through‘What could reasonably be expected?’ The resultant Template contains typi-cally between 20 and 30 characteristics.Stage 4: Interpret and validate issues Each completed template isdiscussed with those generating it. This helps conﬁrm the internal validityof the template and those characteristics important in determining qualityhave been captured. Finally, participants are asked to score those character-istics they consider most important by allocating 100 points between them.Phase III: Exploration, learning and possible actionPhase III draws upon Schein’s (1999) ideas about process consultation. Thetemplates are used as catalysts for the students and lecturers involved to gaininsights into each other’s perceptions and expectations, at a facilitatedmeeting. For this to be successful, there must be sufﬁcient time formeaningful discussion and reﬂection. Facilitation needs to enable open,non-judgemental discussion between participants as they understand eachother’s templates and generate possible agendas for action. The event hasthree stages:Stage 1: Brief participants, surface concerns and re-familiarizeParticipants are reminded of the process to date. The purpose of this two-hour meeting, to share explore, learn and identify possible actions, isrestated.Stage 2: Explore and learn This takes the form of dialogue betweenstudents and lecturers using their templates as catalysts. It focuses uponjointly establishing and understanding which characteristics are importantfor quality and why. The joint nature of the process helps reduce problemsof second order interpretation, as participants who generated the templatesundertake the exploration.Stage 3: Generate possible agendas for action Participants areasked to reﬂect on the meeting and focus upon actions needed to improvequality. Through this an agenda of items requiring action is identiﬁed andowned by the students and lecturers.The application and utility of the Template Process to the evaluation andreview of modules is illustrated now using an evaluation of dissertationsupervision in a new university business school. Within this university,students’ evaluations are a recognised component of quality assurance,6506 ALH 049944 (to/d) 3/2/05 2:06 pm Page 66ACTIVE LEARNING IN HIGHER EDUCATION 6(1)!-, " + 45 ’ "(" " " ( " 01 1 3 %+(66"" (""""((%$$ ) )2 2+" 2//"+’1%2(0’ +" +" + 0 ’" " &* . . . & & 6 6er" " u" . . ! ig’ssecorpyrosivrepusnoitatressideht‘fosnoitatcepxednaetalpmeT1Fsnoit" p! ec$ rep’stneduts% g$ n# itceﬂer06 ALH 049944 (to/d) 3/2/05 2:06 pm Page 67S AU N D E R S & W I L L I A M S : A N A G E N D A F O R Q U A L I T Y I M P R OV E M E N T!,’"&%’---*) ,( +# ’+. .&"!$%$#"!’ssecorpyrosivrepusnoitatressideht‘fosnoitatcepxednasnoitpecrep’srosivrepusgnitceﬂeretalpmeT2erugiF6706 ALH 049944 (to/d) 3/2/05 2:06 pm Page 68A C T I V E L E A R N I N G I N H I G H E R E D U C A T I O N 6(1)questionnaires being used systematically to collect feedback for reviewpurposes.Using the Template ProcessThe dissertation module operating within this business school has, sincethe mid-1990s, doubled in size to over 300 students along with a corre-sponding growth in supervisor numbers. Each student attends six researchmethods workshops, delivered at the start of level III and is allocated asupervisor, who provides one-to-one support. A growing number ofcomments from students regarding the nature and quality of supervisionreceived suggested there were associated issues that had not beenidentified in the end-of-module evaluation questionnaire. This, combinedwith the rapid growth led the module tutor to undertake a full review ofthe dissertation module and its operation. In discussion with the moduletutor, it was agreed that we would act as facilitators using the TemplateProcess to review dissertation supervision. Through this, we aimed tocapture students’ and supervisors’ expectations and perceptions of thedissertation supervision process and their suggestions for possibleactions.Two purposive samples were selected to represent student and supervisorviews. The eight students taking the level III dissertation modulerepresented all degree combinations within the business school, whilst thesix supervisors encompassed a wide range of supervisory and subjectexperience. For both samples, perceptions and expectations of the qualityof the supervisory process were established and recorded separately. Thisresulted in two templates, one illustrating the students’ and the other thesupervisors’ perceptions and expectations. Some of the characteristicscaptured by the students’ template included ‘Advice’, ‘Feedback’, ‘Relation-ship – trust’ and ‘Information – quality’ (see Figure 1) were not capturedin the same words in the supervisors’ template (see Figure 2). Conversely,characteristics in the supervisors’ template, such as ‘Student motivation’,did not appear in the students’ template.Both perceptions and expectations were recorded against the 10-pointscale. Consistency of interpretation of the scales was explored as the percep-tions and expectations for each characteristic were plotted, as well as duringinterpretation and validation. Within each meeting, differences betweenindividuals’ scores for perceived and expected performance were recordedfor each characteristic. These were represented by the length of theperceived performance and expected performance bars. For example, therewas considerably more variation in students’ perceptions of the ‘Availabilityof tutor’ than in their expectations (Figure 1). The gap between students’6806 ALH 049944 (to/d) 3/2/05 2:06 pm Page 69S AU N D E R S & W I L L I A M S : A N A G E N D A F O R Q U A L I T Y I M P R OV E M E N Texpectation that the research methods ‘Workshops time’ should ‘reﬂectdissertation progress/ongoing’ and their perception that they were ‘lumpedtogether’ emphasized the actual gap between their perceptions and expec-tations (Figure 1). The scores revealed those characteristics considered mostimportant by students (‘Advice’, ‘Feedback’ and ‘Relationship-trust’) andsupervisors (‘Assessment criteria clarity’, ‘Student’s commitment to topic’and ‘Student’s attitude/preparedness’).Subsequently, all involved explored the templates jointly. This enabled thestudents and supervisors to begin to develop a shared understanding of therange of views. Discussion was introduced by a short presentation fromstudents and supervisors explaining their own templates and the high-scoring characteristics. Each participant was provided with copies of bothtemplates and necessary clariﬁcations sought. Following the presentations,these students and supervisors chose to discuss and explore the supervisionprocess collectively, focusing on the major differences and similarities ofthe high scoring characteristics and the gaps between perceptions andexpectations (Figures 1 and 2).There were clear concerns for both students and supervisors. Studentshighlighted the consistency of the supervisory process. This is apparent inthe relatively high score (25) of the characteristic ‘Advice’ as well as thewide range of perceptions for many other characteristics (Figure 1). Theideal for ‘Advice’ was ‘consistent level playing ﬁeld’, and these terms wererepeated frequently throughout the discussion. Concerns of supervisorscentred upon assessment criteria; apparent in the characteristics: ‘Assess-ment criteria – clarity’ and ‘Assessment criteria – objective measurement’(Figure 2). For both, the relatively wide range of perceptions suggesteddifferences in views. Subsequent discussion highlighted further differences.Whereas supervisors indicated that support might not reasonably be‘readily available’, their perceptions emphasized wide variation in practice(Figure 2). In contrast, students expected support should ‘reﬂect individualstudent need’ and ‘sufﬁcient “quality time”’ should be available, whilstperceiving wide variations in practice (Figure 1).As part of the meeting we asked student and supervisors to record the‘main messages’ from the templates and suggest ‘actions that would reallymake a difference’. This resulted in, for example, an agreement to resched-ule research methods workshops to reﬂect more closely the stages studentsshould have reached in their dissertations. Supervisors agreed to exploreissues of consistency of advice at a subsequent staff development session.This highlighted that there was more agreement regarding the nature of thedissertation than supervisors had assumed and that the discussion washelpful in developing a common understanding. However, further workwas needed on consistency of advice, in particular the amount of help that6906 ALH 049944 (to/d) 3/2/05 2:06 pm Page 70A C T I V E L E A R N I N G I N H I G H E R E D U C A T I O N 6(1)should reasonably be given to students. A working group considered thissubsequently.DiscussionThe Template Process allowed students and lecturers to generate indepen-dently those characteristics they believed were important to a deﬁnedteaching and learning situation. Subsequently, gaps between perceptionsand expectations for each characteristic were tested and recorded. Theprocess therefore offers a method for establishing valid informationconsidered important, rather than reﬂecting the assumptions and values ofthe evaluation instrument designer. Despite an apparent lack of common-ality in the language used by students and lecturers, there were oftenelements of common ground in the important characteristics. Where thiswas not the case, it emphasized that students and lecturers were operatingwithin differing assumptions and norms. The Template Process thereforeenables issues to be surfaced that may challenge the established modes ofteaching and learning.These observations reinforce the use of the Template Process within aprocess consultation framework, the facilitator acting as guardian of theprocess. Her or his role is to ensure that both students and lecturerscontribute fully to template generation and validation (Phase II). Duringthe subsequent exploration, learning and possible action (Phase III), thefacilitator helps focus dialogue on both learning and action. She or he musttherefore be able to listen to individuals’ contributions, summarize alterna-tive views and judge when to move the process towards identifying possibleactions. Colleagues who have undertaken this role have commented that theskills required are similar to those they use when leading seminar groups.However, the requirement for the facilitator to be, and to be seen to be,neutral means that she or he is unlikely to be part of the module team.The advantages of the Template Process appear to be greatest for moduleswhere problems or issues related to quality are evident but deﬁned poorly.In such instances the process allows students and lecturers to deﬁne theissue independently in their own words. Visual representation of the datafacilitates confrontative intervention as students and lecturers explore eachother’s views (Phase III). By doing this jointly, differences and similaritiesin the norms and values upon which these ideas are based are highlightedleading to new mutual understandings speciﬁc to that situation. Participantinterpretation and dialogue help maintain data integrity and ensure that thelevel and nature of detail available is sufﬁcient upon which to act. Thediscursive nature of this phase also allows different views to be discussed,understood and recognized within the speciﬁed context.7006 ALH 049944 (to/d) 3/2/05 2:06 pm Page 71S AU N D E R S & W I L L I A M S : A N A G E N D A F O R Q U A L I T Y I M P R OV E M E N TThe Template Process is, compared to traditional means of evaluatingquality, time consuming for both the students and the lecturers involved.For this reason it has been used only on a maximum of one module peryear group for a course, either as an integral part of teaching (for examplein modules on research methods or managing service operations), wherethere appears to be an issue or problem that is poorly deﬁned, or in thecontext of a more major review. Subsequently, the characteristics identiﬁedas important have been incorporated in more traditional evaluationmethods. We have found that students enjoy the interactive aspects ofdeveloping their templates and subsequently working with lecturers todevelop possible actions to improve quality. The majority have commentedthat they found the process engaging and that, unlike more traditionalmethods of evaluation, their contributions were really valued. In addition,by introducing variety to the methods of evaluation used across a course,student fatigue with more traditional approaches appears to be reduced.In conclusion, the Template Process reﬂects the reality of a dyadic inter-change between students and lecturers in teaching and learning. It is notintended to provide a statistically representative evaluation. Rather, it offersan additional tool to the range of existing quality assessment processes. Theprocess enables students and lecturers to test their assumptions about anexisting module independently prior to developing a common understand-ing of any problems or issues and possible actions. Because predeterminedscales are not used, the process is applicable without modiﬁcation to evalu-ating quality across a range of teaching and learning situations. The facilita-tor’s role is to assist in the derivation, exploration and subsequent dialogueabout the templates and agreement of possible courses of action. The processtherefore offers an additional tool that, although time-consuming for thoseinvolved, captures the data in a systematic manner. Integral to the process isthe need for discussion, understanding and learning about problems andissues and taking ownership of agreed solutions – aspects whose importancehas been highlighted in the maintenance and enhancement of quality.References<ref>B I N G H A M , R . & OT T E W I L L , R .
