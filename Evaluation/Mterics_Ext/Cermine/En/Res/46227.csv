Catherine Delcroix, Elsa LagierIntergenerational transmissions intransnational families and national affiliationsAbstract:This article explains and illustrates the method of family histories, reconstructed fromcrossed biographical interviews of different members of the same family. This methodolo-gy allows for the collection of fine and precious data in order to try to understand thecomplexity of the dynamics of intergenerational transmissions and the construction of na-tional affiliations of immigrants’ descendants. It shows how continuously shifting familyrelationships underlie creativity in parenting strategies. In addition, this approach cancircumvent some specific barriers to the study of immigrant families, who often speak un-easily with researchers. This methodology helps us to avoid reification of static identities.Key words: Family history, parenting, intergenerational transmission, migration paths,passing on, affiliation, crossed biographical interviews.1 IntroductionHaving followed several immigrant families in France and in other Europeancountries over long periods as ethnographic observers and biographical-narrativeinterviewers, we specifically focused on how they try to find ways to fight the ef-fects of stigmatization (or “discredit”). We discovered that most parents are con-tinuously adapting their parenting styles and techniques to guide their children’sdevelopment. Some of their children face a double bind: on the one hand, the hostsociety asks them to “integrate”, that means to enter labour markets and melt in-to the host country ways of life. On the other hand teachers, employers, the policeand media keep considering them as “different”. This tension is particularly sig-nificant in France, whereas it appears easier for immigrants to find their room inGermany (Pape 2012). But in both countries immigrant parents show tremendouscreativity in trying to help their children, boys and girls differently, to cope withthis double bind1.Immigrant parents who succeed in migrating from their country, an ex-colony,to the “colonising” European country have to face not only xenophobia but alsoZQF 15. Jg., Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 25‒3826ZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 25‒38post-colonial prejudices on both labour and housing markets and in the contexts ofboth work and everyday life. Nevertheless the vast majority of migrants are carry-ing within themselves a project for a better life: for themselves, for their kin athome, and especially for their children, boys and girls; a project that orients,drives, and organizes all their courses of action. But in bringing up and educatingtheir children, these parents become aware of the difficulty of the task.Most of these families possess neither economic resources nor credentials butall try to varying degrees to pass down to their children “personal resources”,which we call subjective resources2. One of the ways they do that is by explainingto their daughters and sons their family story, specifically why they have left theircountry of origin and have come to the host country they live in. Indeed the keyelement of this process of transmission from generation to generation is throughthe telling of family histories. As Robert Neuburger suggests, “Passing down suc-cessfully amounts to passing down the ability to pass down” (Neuburger 1997, p.15). Family history, as told by parents to children, is a tool, conveying not only in-formation about the past and tradition, but also about the need for change. Andthe power of these stories, as Toshiaki Kozakaï remarks, rests not on biologicalparenthood, but on bonding through the sharing of childhood years (Kozakaï2000).But this is a hard task. Some migrant parents seem to have difficulties in pass-ing down their own life history to their children. This history will have beenshaped by a twofold series of humiliating experiences. First, and common to eve-rybody, irrespective of whether they were born in France, Germany or have emi-grated, is the experience of having occupied the lowest posts in society. Second,and specific to immigrants, is the racism that they have experienced. Immigrantparents have often difficult family histories in relation to colonisation, wars…They are sometimes prone to silence when it comes to admitting what they havebeen through. But this silence is also a collective phenomenon in which the mediaplay a large part. Indeed for example the media continue ignoring the history ofFrench working class (immigrant being a significant part of this class), while en-hancing the history of the French peasantry as part of national identity.In our French-German seminar we have worked on this difficulty of passing onfamily history and we have linked this process of transmission to that of socialisa-tion which is a conscious process carried out by agents who aim to inculcate intochildren and teenagers the norms of the host society. Peers from the host societyplay a crucial role in socialising migrant children. As Jean Piaget explains in hisbook “Jugement moral chez l’enfant” (The moral judgment of the child) (1392/2000),one cannot neglect the role of the child her or himself as an active participant inthis process of self-socialisation. He or she adapts him or herself to the environ-ment, but impinges also on it (and first of all, on his or her parents).Socialisation cannot be reduced to schooling; it is an implicit impregnation. Themoments within the family must contribute to giving meaning to the past andpresent lived experiences of parents and children here (host country) and there(country of origin). The success (or failure) of this process also depends on howfamily memory and history are connected, and how parents are able to legitimatein a dynamic way their own culture of origin avoiding contradictions and silences.But parents have to find partners (teachers, friends, neighbours, community lea-ders or family members) to avoid a “guerre des mémoires” (war of memories) (Blan-chard/Veyrat-Masson 2008; Bhabha 1994/2007; Saïd 1979/1994). Colonisation andpost-colonialism are indeed difficult subjects to deal with and are often the occa-C. Delcroix, E. Lagier: Intergenerational transmissions in transnational families27sion of such a “war” opposing different ways to understand and talk about pastevents, regarding the group of belonging. Each group tends to defend its memoryand, considering the place or country they live in, some have more chances thanthe other to be able to have their (his)tory recognized as a legitimate one.The situation is different in France and Germany. In Germany, because of its“defeat” in World War II, the “re-education” measures by the Allies, the public tri-als such as those in Nuremberg or the Auschwitz trials in Frankfurt and ensuingpublic debates, it appears that self-critical reflexivity about national history seemsto be more developed than in France. The sense of belonging of migrant childrenand their national affiliation depends on the dialogue between migrant parentsand the host society. This dialogue, more or less easy to establish, depends itselfon the history of the different countries. The room given to migrants and theirown stories is also due to the political system and tradition in the host countries,more or less centralized. And, more specifically, it comes from the different na-tional histories regarding migration and the different ways the national policieshave been dealing with it. “While France has been marked by its integration mod-el through assimilation, there still exists no clear integration policy in Germany(Simon 2005, Thränhardt 2009)” (Pape 2012, p. 430). We focus here on the Frenchsituation and its specificities that are enlightened thanks to a comparison withthe situation in Germany; this comparison is a further result of our work duringthe seminar and of the discussion of the papers of our colleagues.We will first present our methodology of reconstructing family histories bymeans of “entretiens croisés” (crossed interviews) of parents and children. Thenwe will present some case histories of transnational families, questioning the dy-namics between intergenerational transmissions and national affiliations. Foreach case, we met and interviewed the two parents and, at least, one of the chil-dren (in most cases two). The interviews were biographical: they were followingboth the life course of the interviewee and the way he or she made links betweenthe different events marking it. They lasted, in general, between one hour and ahalf and three hours. Some were repeated across time, once or twice.In the first two cases we provide examples of migrants’ descendants facing dif-ficulties in the construction of their affiliation to a given nation, and we show howthey tend to choose one main affiliation excluding the others. In the last two casestudies we show how immigrant parents help their children to build various affili-ations to several nations, by using specific strategies of bringing-up. The develop-ment of one or the other model has to do with the family’s migration history andthe meaning they gave to it.2 The methodology of crossed biographicalinterviewsBefore presenting our comments on the subtle processes involved in intergenera-tional transmission, it is important to discuss the methodology used to collect thedata. We used a process of “récits croisés” (Delcroix, 1995), comparing and con-trasting data generated through (biographical interviews) with different membersof the same family. We also explain below how this method both provides a source28ZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 25‒38of rich information and also circumvents some of the specific difficulties commonlyencountered in the study of migrant families.2.1 Using life stories within the same familyTo study the evolution of feelings of national affiliation of immigrants and theirdescendants, we have conducted a large number of biographical-narrative inter-views in different fieldwork contexts. As Daniel Bertaux argues, the biographicalapproach allows researchers to study “a particular fragment of social and histori-cal reality from an ethno-sociological perspective [...] focusing on the patterns ofsocial relations [...] that characterize it” (Bertaux 1997, p. 7)3. Given that there area number of social and cultural dimensions in any specific context (Schütz 1987),identifying the specific configuration of these dimensions requires a study of thiscase, with an inductive approach, to capture the social logics that it testifies. Thestories collected deal with both practices, beliefs and representations, which arepresented in a diachronic structure that gives them meaning and allows us tomake connections between them. The objective is to encourage the narration ofevents, the description of the relations linking them and the explanation of therepresentations that social actors develop about those facts. The challenge is tounderstand potential causal pathways and to understand the meaning they havefor individuals, reasoning in the framework of a comprehensive approach.To investigate how feelings of national affiliation result from intergenerationaltransmissions of family migration history in immigrant families in France, wehave developed this approach, following the method established by CatherineDelcroix: the reconstruction of family histories, drawn from life story interviewswith several members of each family (Delcroix 2000; 2009; 2001/2013). The rele-vance of this methodology lies in the importance of the family as a “micro-environment of inter-subjective relations where [...] emotional, moral and “seman-tic” relations dominate, that is to say, generate meaning” (Bertaux 1997, p. 38)4.The family members are as “significant others”, in the words of George HerbertMead, particularly important.In this article we have focused in particular on working-class families, originat-ing from Maghreb or Sub-Saharan Africa, facing economic instability and discrimi-nation. In order to reach a better understanding of the experiences of these familiesand their members, it was essential for us to hear their own intimate accounts oftheir lives. This is not easy to achieve and requires the building of a relationship oftrust able to counteract the effects of stigmatizing discourses that can hinder thedesire of these people to share their life story. It was then important to explain thatwe were not there to examine and judge them but to grasp and describe the effortsthey were making to overcome their difficulties. Thus, we have reconstructed in-depth case studies of immigrant families, using an approach combining ethno-graphic and sociological methods. The ethnographic approach consists in spendingas much time as possible with the families, in their everyday life activities or onoutings and on holidays, to observe what they do and discuss what they think. Thesociological approach seeks to identify different types of life paths and diverse pro-files of families and to analyse the collective processes they are experiencing.The objective of this method is to locate each of social actors within the frame-work of family time and historical time, investigating several generations. Meet-C. Delcroix, E. Lagier: Intergenerational transmissions in transnational families29ing parents and children, talking with them about their lives helps us to recon-struct the general history of the family and discover how each of its members hasexperienced and understood this shared history. But with each of them, we can al-so collect different information, which allows us to situate the family history in awider temporality. Parent’s stories offer an opportunity to make connections be-tween past and present. Making them talk about their childhood can also be an oc-casion to know more about the generation of grandparents. The stories of theirchildren provide links between the present and the future. We have access to theirprojects and how they are becoming adults by re-appropriating their family history.Before highlighting the richness of data collected through this methodology, wewill now describe why it is that this approach is particularly important to over-come difficulties faced in carrying out fieldwork with migrant families.2.2 Specific difficulties in the study of immigrant familiesAs Ursula Apitzsch stated in our Franco-German seminar, ethnicity or ratherethnic affiliations, are in tension between potentially stigmatizing ascribed identi-ty and self-claimed identity. She spoke of the difficult dialectic between both eth-nicity as a form of often-unwelcome attribution by others and ethnicity as a formof a conscious self-definition of individuals within the social context of a communi-ty. She added that, paradoxically, the second process produces the tendency oftransforming ethnic belonging into an inheritable social position. But how tostudy this “transformation” while the claim of an ethnic identity seen as “other” inEuropean societies, is often devalued and causes “social sanctions” as for instancedifficulty to find a job?Indeed, immigrant families in France and Germany face a major discredit be-cause of their geographical origin and their cultural practices. They carry “discred-iting differences” which have a double effect: their visibility in the public sphere issubject to negative stereotypes or they are confined to invisibility. In both cases,their existence is not recognised, or is only recognised with difficulty. This discredittends to make it more complex to know the actions of immigrants and their chil-dren, their plans, and their discourses, as soon as they seem to move away from themodel to which they are expected to comply: a well “integrated” worker.This phenomenon is particularly strong in France, because of its republicanmodel that de-legitimises foreign origin and all practices and claims for recognition(Honneth 1992/2000). The discrediting discourse derives partly from the experienceof colonisation that initially shaped the representations of colonised people that stillweigh on their descendants. This is particularly true for Muslims. A good exampleof this would be the experience of Algerians who were offered French nationalityonly if they agreed to renounce Islam (Décret Crémieux 1870; Delcroix 2009).This public and political discourse has a very tangible impact on the attitudesand discourses of migrants and their descendants. As a reaction, they tend toerase what is perceived in the host country as unacceptable differences in someeveryday practises. In the way they present themselves, some seem to deliberatelyforget their foreign origin, or underestimate its importance. It was only afterspending time with them that they began talking openly with us about it. Others,however, respond by “turning the stigma”, as Erving Goffman said, claiming theiridentity in a positive way, as for example when Muslim women decide to wear the30ZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 25‒38veil, this practice being sometimes associated with an explicitly political discourse.In all cases, they have to deal with multiple identities, some of which are more orless stigmatizing (Lagier 2011).In addition from the point of view of the host countries, the history of migrantsoften begins from when they crossed the border to settle here. However, beforemigrating, these individuals are first emigrants who left their country of origin, asrecalled by Abdelmalek Sayad (1999). But everything regarding their past islargely undervalued and is not considered by the institutions of the host countriesas a worthy story to be told. Thus, unlike the French and German families in theirrespective countries, migrant families are isolated to pass on their history andmemory (Bertaux/Delcroix 2009). They are not supported by the institutions of thecountry of installation, especially the schools and the media, and are even dis-couraged from doing so on behalf of the idea that integration requires forgettingone’s origin. It is, again, difficult to have access to their history and how it ispassed on through generations.But these difficulties should not be considered as curbing the study. Insteadthey are to be treated as being fully part of the study. To better understand thesocial logic that shapes migrant families’ lives, the method of reconstructing fami-ly histories is particularly valuable. It gives indeed access to educational strate-gies implemented by parents, to the dynamics of intergenerational transmissions,to gender relations; and to the processes of collective and individual constructionof feelings of affiliation to one or several nations. This is what we want to show inthe following case studies.3 Case studies: a multi-affiliation difficult to manageLet us now see some examples, case studies, illustrating the efficiency of themethod and its relevance to study national affiliations of the different members oftransnational families. The first two case studies present situations where the mi-gration paths and the transmission – or non-transmission – of family history leadto affiliations difficult to manage for the immigrants’ descendants. They then tendto favour one specific (national) identification among all those they might recog-nize themselves in, as shown in the first case. Or they face difficulties in buildingtheir affiliation and identification, as shown in the second case.3.1 When “forced migration” and discredit lead to choosing aunique affiliation: the Roinamze Family5 historyThe Roinamze family, of Togolese origin by the father and Ghanaian origin by themother, has a special story. Parents came to live in France with their young chil-dren in the late 1970s to escape Togo after a military coup put an end to the re-public. The father, Leon, had kinship-ties with a former member of the president'sfamily who was murdered. When he learnt that he also was threatened, he decid-ed to flee with his family to France – he had already stayed several times in thiscountry before – to ask for the status of political refugee.C. Delcroix, E. Lagier: Intergenerational transmissions in transnational families31The two parents are very bonded to their country of origin and their African ori-gins. The mother regularly goes and stays in Ghana – a country in which the fami-ly has no difficulties to travel to – and she brings her children there on holidays.When we met the family, she was in Ghana, where she was creating an orphanage;she has spent most of her time there in recent years. The older daughter has re-cently settled in Ghana; she works in a bank in Accra. The fact that the motherand the daughter live in Ghana demonstrates the strength of the links maintainedwith the country, even if the price is the distance between family members.Leon, the father, is also very attached to his country, Togo, and he wishes to re-turn there as soon as possible and regain a political position. Even if he lives faraway, he is very involved in the political life of this country. He is a member, inFrance, of a Togolese opposition party. He said: “I have carnal relations with Togobecause I am very politically involved in Togo today, since I am a member of theFrench section of the Union of Forces for Change in Togo”6.But the family is also closely connected to France, and some members are in-volved in local associative life in their neighbourhood. One of the girls is involvedin an association for school tutoring, and Leon is elected to the city council. Butthe eyes of most members of the family are turned towards Africa, to Ghana andTogo in particular.The migration trajectory of the parents was not immediately told to the chil-dren. Kofi, one of the five children in the family, a young 32 year-old man7, ex-plained that it is primarily his grandmother, living in Ghana, who made himaware of the history of his father and the danger he faced. Migration is presentedas constrained to the political context. But, more broadly, the way parents haveexplained this trajectory and the way children have understood it as a “tearing”(Kofi), may result from the fact their migration meant a significant social down-grading for the family. The father and mother belong to the upper classes of theirrespective countries of origin. Their families are large landowners. Leon had alarge transport company before being forced to emigrate. On arriving in France heworked as boilermaker and then as caretaker.This “forced” and painful migration trajectory, leading to significant socialdowngrading, may explain the difficulty in developing a positive affiliation to theFrench nation. Most members of the family we have met wish to return to Togo orGhana. But for the father, Leon, and for his son, Kofi – we both interviewed themextensively – ambitions are not the same. Leon wants to go to Togo to participatein the political life of his country. Kofi also wants to return but to carry on its“pan-African political struggle” beyond the Togolese context. If the father defineshimself as Togolese, the son primarily defines himself as “Black”. The more radi-cal political involvement of Kofi can be understood as a reaction to the discreditand racism experienced in France. But for both, the migration history path, itsconsequences and its understanding by each of them, could have encouraged thefact that they define themselves by a single affiliation, national origin for the fa-ther and “racial” identity for the son.In the Roinamze family, between Leon and Kofi in particular, what has beenpassed on is not only a relation to the country of origin or to the host country; it isalso a relation to political commitment. The importance of politics comes from itsplace in the family history before migration, its essential role as a motivation tomigrate, and from the fact that the father is very involved. Thus, if Kofi explainshis involvement in radical pan-Africanism from the racism he has been victim ofas a Black in France, it can also be understood as a form of affiliation to the line-32ZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 25‒38age of his father. If the commitments of Leon and Kofi are quite different, they al-so have much in common: both are “oriented” towards the country or region oforigin, and both generate intense activities and identifications. About this, Leonsaid “I even think that’s what keeps me alive”. And we find the same idea when Ko-fi told us “My political struggle is the struggle of my life”.In the end, the intense political involvement certainly strengthens the tendencyto affiliate to one nation or one origin for the defence of which they feel they mustfight. But this impossible construction of a multi-affiliation is also due to the mi-gration path and how the children understood it, and from the racism experiencedin France. More generally, this case illustrates how intergenerational transmis-sions are made of continuity and discontinuity. Nothing is ever passed on un-changed through generations, without modification, without specific appropriationby descendants. The method of family history reconstruction through crossed bio-graphical interviews allows us to capture these subtle processes by giving accessto spheres of meaning construction of various protagonists.3.2 A “closed family”: the impact of being an orphan in thecountry of originThe following second case is a typical example of a father categorically refusing todiscuss his own experiences with his children. Mr Mohammed is the father of fourchildren. He came from Algeria with his wife twenty years ago. He has just retiredfrom working for a small servicing company that forms part of the French rail-ways (SNCF). For Mr Mohammed, the most important task is to protect his chil-dren from the external world that he sees as threatening. His 16-year-old son de-scribes their relation:“My parents, my father, they don’t trust me to go… even now to Wilson Square (the citycentre). He has never been to the cinema with me, in fact, I have never been to the cine-ma at all. During the holidays I do nothing with my parents, with my father… My par-ents are worried about me.”Mr. Mohammed did not want to be interviewed and his wife explained his refusalin this way:“My children don’t go to their friend’s house… The most important thing is to pay the rentfirst. My husband has just been forced to retire and I don’t work. He leaves the house inthe morning to go for walks and comes back in the evening… He hasn’t had a close friendsince he was married. He is a solitary person, like myself.”This inward-looking attitude came about as the result of several negative experi-ences, as Mrs Mohammed went on to describe:“When we first came to France, the social worker wanted to send us back to Algeria. Shesaid that the room we were living in was too small. But it was our choice to live in anoth-er country, although in coming here in France we are not free. In France, the authoritiesconstantly check us. It is not easy for us… Wherever they go, my children are seen as for-eigners. […] I sometimes feel that we have made a big mistake. You are Arabs, you areforeigners, you are immigrants… You go into an office and they make you aware of it allthe time. Even my little girl of 6 understands. However, some things are better here thanover there: freedom, free speech, and trustworthy persons; but we are still strangers… Itis difficult for their father. He never says anything and he doesn’t know Algeria (he cameC. Delcroix, E. Lagier: Intergenerational transmissions in transnational families33to France at a very young age and never went back to Algeria). At the same time, hedoesn’t want to change his nationality and he could never live with other Algerians.”Behind the silence of this father is a personal history. As he told it to us, he neverknew his own father. Moreover, as he is an orphan, he had no experience of a fa-ther-child relationship. In addition to that, he cannot count on the help of anybodyin his country of origin to help him in any sense. Thus, he does not have an “onto-logical security” (Giddens 1991). Opposite to common sense, it is essential for par-ents to have relations based on community belonging to be able to open transna-tional spaces to their children. Mr Mohammed could not pass on to his childrenhis life story, which according to his wife, was characterized by a great deal ofcourage in the face of adversity. His children do not know to which country theybelong. Here we can see how the two processes of family transmission and nation-al belonging are related.4Case studies: the opening of a range ofpossibilitiesUnlike the previous cases, the following two case studies show the influence of thepassing on of family migration history on the life courses of children, their careerchoices, their places of residence and how they feel they belong to several nationsat once. These cases illustrate how intergenerational transmissions open a rangeof possibilities in the construction of life courses and the identification of children.4.1 Intergenerational transmissions and the children’s choiceof a country to work and to live in: the Tahar Family casehistoryAmong the numerous families of migrants from Maghreb that we studied is MrTahar, a migrant from Morocco, who has a specific strategy. He has five daughtersand one son, who is the last child. He came to France with the project of gettinghis baccalauréat (Abitur in German) and continuing on as a university student.But for various reasons he could not do it, and he has been working for the lasttwenty years as a truck-driver.He has developed a particular style of parenting which we find quite imagina-tive: taking his children, one at a time, with him in his truck when the trip he hasto do is only for a few hundred kilometres and back. This way he is able to developa personalised relationship with each one of his children. All of them considerthese trips with their father as privileged moments. “We talk a lot”, his elderdaughter told us.“He has been taking me to various French cities, and he has explained to me their histo-ry. He has been telling me about cities he has visited in Germany, Italy… It was so inter-esting. I developed a taste for foreign languages, and now I am studying to become an in-terpreter, with a focus on German; because, according to what my father says, Germanyis a country I would like to live in”.34ZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 25‒38Her younger sister told us how much she enjoyed the stories her father told herabout the times he was growing up in Rabat. This is where she wants to live.She also took much interest in how her father was driving his truck: changinggears, checking that the engine and other parts function well, and taking goodcare of his truck…“I watch when he puts on the handbrake. I would love to driveand get my licence”. Now, at 18 years-old, she knows exactly what she wants todo: to start an international trucking company in Morocco. Still at high school,she has chosen a commercial orientation. She has a passion for trucks and ispresently getting her driving license for trucks. Even if her dream does not ma-terialise – it was already the case for her father – this young lady already knowswhere she wants to go and is busy trying to get there. And it is the same for herelder sister.A very important point is that this creative strategy has been elaborated to-gether with the mother. The example of this man gave us a first hint about therelevance for children’s self-representation, self-esteem, self-confidence and gen-eral psychic balance, of whether they knew or not the history of their parents –which is, in fact, their own pre-history. It was clear from what the two daughtersexplained that, because their father had told each of them, separately, in long in-formal conversations, who he was, and why he had migrated to France, they knewpretty well where they were and why they were born in France from Moroccanparents. It gives them a sense of continuity, a set of spatial and temporal markers;in short it helps them build their own identity.This is only a specific example of a much more general attitude and practicewhich we have observed in many families: passing on to children the inner subjec-tive resources they need to overcome the handicap they have from their ethnic andsocial background, so that, remaining in France or not, they will be able to fully ex-ercise their status of citizen. Mr Tahar has opened the door to future options for hisdaughters. The elder two sisters do not have to choose between different nationalaffiliations; they already live in a transnational space because their father has beenable to give them an idea of the world through his own experiences of migrationand work. He enables them to be open to but critical of various cultural and socialworlds.4.2 Multi-affiliation as an educational project: the BenarmaFamily case historyWahid Benarma, the father, came as a young man to France in the late 1960s; hewas unemployed in Algeria. He was hoping to return to school and find a betterjob than those he had had up to that point. But fairly quickly, he was forced tolower his ambitions. He said: “I did odd jobs, only odd jobs”. He became a materialhandler and workman. He married in Algeria in the late 1970s and his wife Dja-mila came to live with him in France. Unfortunately he was victim of an industri-al accident and Djamila had to take menial jobs to meet the needs of the homeand allow their children to go to college.Djamila and Wahid have two children: a daughter, Zineb, 20 years old and ason, Karim, 25 years old. Their parents strongly encouraged both of them to suc-ceed in school and get a tertiary education. Both have appropriated this discourseon the importance of academic success, seen as a necessary prelude to the success-C. Delcroix, E. Lagier: Intergenerational transmissions in transnational families35ful career their parents hope for them. Djamila and Wahid passed on this projectto their children by mobilising their past personal experiences. They explainedthat they did not have the opportunity to study in Algeria, and encouraged themto take advantage of the opportunity they have to be born in France and be able toget a proper education. Wahid even said: “If I had been to school, I would have hada job, I would not even have had to come to France”.After a Master degree in International Business, Karim became manager in alarge international group in the oil sector. Zineb, meanwhile, goes to a school fortourism after having spent a year at university studying English. Karim ex-plained the origins of his ambition:“My personal motivation is my parents … That’s what made me want to go ahead, seeingthem sacrifice, so to say, for me and my sister. I have no right to disappoint them [...]whereas they gave me the chance to have a roof, good health, an education, somethingthat millions of people have not yet in some countries”The sacrifice of his parents that he refers to is twofold: on the one hand their mi-gration to come to France and on the other hand the difficult jobs they have heldin order to finance their children’s studies.Indeed, Djamila’s choice to work while Wahid could no longer do so is directlyrelated to her children. She said: “I will continue to work for my children [until re-tirement] [...] I have much helped Karim [for studying] and again until now, I helpZineb. If I work now, it’s mostly for my children”. The involvement of these par-ents is well understood by their children who contribute, by their own success, tothe success of the whole family project to improve living conditions. Zineb told usabout the trajectory of her family: “It’s true that we started a little at the bottom ofthe ladder because my parents came from Algeria, immigrant parents, we startedfrom nothing and then gradually it rose through the ranks”.But the Benarma family project is not merely about social success passed onbetween generations. It is also about attachment to different national affiliationsconsidered as necessarily multiple. The choices of school and professional trajecto-ries of the children show a real attraction for foreign countries, particularly thoseoverseas. This cosmopolitism is a consequence of a conscious educational strategyof their parents: the Benarma parents tell their story to Zineb and Karim and givethem very positive descriptions of their country of origin, Algeria, where they goon holiday, as well as of their home country, France, where they travel often to-gether as a family. Wahid said for instance, that France is a country that has giv-en him a “second education”, which made him know his rights as a human being.Djamila said that the first day after her arrival in France, she already felt “athome”. They also talk about the difficult colonial history between France and Al-geria. Wahid said about independence: “We went through hell”. But the colonialperiod is presented to children in a positive way about France, as if to preserve a“good image” of this country. The father explains that France is not responsiblefor colonialism but accuses Europeans in general and Spain in particular.In return, the children feel that it is “a chance to be in France”, even if it is not“la vie en rose” as Karim says. At the same time both are very closely linked totheir parents’ country of origin. Before getting a job offer in Dubai – where he haslived ever since – Karim wanted to take part in his company’s creation of an affili-ated branch in Algeria. Zineb, in turn, would like to develop tourism in Algeria.Both present themselves as “citizens of the world”, with special bonds to Franceand Algeria.36ZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 25‒38As their life courses go, the Benarma parents have had to make compromiseson their initial migration project and Wahid in particular on his professional pro-ject. In this case study, children have inherited these compromises and have ap-propriated them to follow the ambitions that accompanied the migration of theirparents. Additionally, they also inherit a form of “multi-affiliation”, with the par-ents saying that they are proud to be Algerian and happy to live in France, theirchildren being French. They have gradually rebuilt their national affiliations andpassed on to their children this reconstruction in process. Their children appropri-ate it in their choices of career and country of residence. Such dynamics highlightthat what is passed on between generations is not a set of stabilised choices, prac-tices or values but representations, history, ways to act, etc. that are subject tochange. Using this idea, during the Franco-German seminar, we proposed usingthe term “transmissions of compromises” (Elsa Lagier) between parents and chil-dren. Passing on compromises and changes that parents experienced throughouttheir life course enables children to build affiliations to several nations at once.5 Conclusion: Accessing educational strategies andintergenerational transmissionsTo conclude, the reconstruction of family histories gives very good access to thepoint that the object of transmission, according to Pierre Legendre (1985/2004), isto pass on. Beyond the obvious tautological point of this statement lies the factthat it is the act of passing on something (anything) which is by itself the wholepoint, more than the content of what is passed on (be it land property, politicalcommitment, or some particular attachment). In families with few or no resources,where there is no objective “capital” to pass on, there are still the non-tangible as-sets of moral values and love which, together with the family history, can givemeaning to the current situation. This methodology helps us to avoid reification ofstatic identities.A method against the reification of representations and affiliationsIn general, the biographical approach and the use of narrative as a method of in-quiry encourage individuals to place their experiences in time, to refer to theirpast, and help locate the “turning points” in their life courses. Furthermore,through crossed interviews within a family, we have access to the planned actionover several generations. This avoids any temptation to reify representations andaffiliations since they are grasped in the long term and in their dynamics. Thus,for instance, it is not a question of studying identity but of studying identificationsin their plurality and their evolutions. We thus obtain data on the development offeelings of national affiliation of migrant parents and their children, according tothe initial migration project and its progressive reconstruction over life courses.Studying the dynamics of intergenerational transmissionsAdditionally, collecting life stories from parents and children allows an in-depthexamination of educational strategies and dynamics of intergenerational trans-C.

This is to reveal the parents’ educational practices and how they organ-ise themselves to try to give their children resources, values and principles. Recip-rocally, it is to capture, in the children’s discourses, what they retain from the ed-ucation provided by parents and, more widely, from the family history as it is re-lated.Moreover, we have information on what is passed on or not, in the privatesphere, in a different way for each child, depending on his/her sex, age, sibling po-sition, etc. We then seek to compare the educational projects of the parents withwhat their children keep, how they build their own family memory, their valuesand how they make choices from the “palette” of affiliations that is, more or lessconsciously, offered to them.Studying the individual and collective construction of feelings ofaffiliationFinally, the method that we use provides not only information about feelings of af-filiation – with their fluctuations – but also permits us to know how the familymembers interact with each other and to compare how these affiliations are ex-plained or justified by the different family members. Thus, we can study both theweight of external factors and the personal experiences that take part in shapingthese claimed affiliations and how they are individually constructed for each fami-ly member, based on the family heritage and the life courses and experiences ofeach person. In so doing, we are able to analyse the construction of national affili-ations as these echo the individual life course and relate to each individual’s placewithin the family, which should be considered a group that is central to the for-mation of identity and sense of belonging.Notes1 This paper is based on the results of several research projects conducted in Francemainly and other European countries. Between 2005 and 2008, Catherine Delcroix andElsa Lagier have worked together on researching participation of inhabitants to thepublic policy of urban renewal in two French cities: Dreux and Vernouillet, They metand interviewed 40 families living in deprived neighborhood, using the method ofcrossed biographical interviews presented in this paper. They chose families with simi-lar living situations, and similar problems in terms of migration, work, resources andfamily life. Our aim was to identify the different types of life paths and diverse profilesof these city families.To compare with migrant families living in Germany they based their comparisons onthe PHD results of Elise Pape (a member of our French-German seminar) on “Inter-generational transmission processes in families with Moroccan origins in France andGermany: “The pride to be oneself”, 2012, Strasbourg, Francfort. She had reconstructthe history of 9 families living in France and in Germany. She had interviewed 40members of these families (half in France and half in Germany).2 By this Catherine Delcroix means first of all, moral strength, courage, resilience, pa-tience, tenacity but also reflexivity, imagination, and communicative skills; a resourcewhich is developed out of an intense reflexive process on one’s own biographical expe-riences (Delcroix 2000; 2009).3 Translation by the authors.4 Translation by the authors.38ZQF Heft 1‒2/2014, S. 25‒385 All the names have been replaced by other names, respecting their significance interms of cultural backgrounds.6 All quotations from interviews are translated by the authors.7 At the time we met and interviewed him.
