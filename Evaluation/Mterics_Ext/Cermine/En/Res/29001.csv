IntroductionIn the field of educational research, the dominant discourse is squarely focusedon the practices of humans such as teachers and students (SØRENSON, 2007).This makes a great deal of sense since education is primarily concerned withhuman learning. In some cases, however, this focus on human practices maymask the roles that materials play and furthermore limit the richness ofunderstanding concerning learning situations (SHAFFER & CLINTON, 2006). Inmathematics education, for example, some researchers have gone as far as tosuggest that the intrinsic characteristics of educational technologies cease tomediate learning and become increasingly transparent as learners' incorporatethem in their mathematical activities (MEIRA, 1998). Such approaches privilegethe role of humans to the point of obscuring important aspects of the meditationalrole that materials have in mathematics learning and any intrinsic educationalvalue they might have (SHAFFER & CLINTON, 2005, 2006). [1]© 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung / Forum: Qualitative Social Research (ISSN 1438-5627)FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld TechnologyIn this paper, I focus on the role of materials in education by investigating theinclusion of a handheld digital technology in mathematics classrooms. As aparticular technological case, I examine the development and use of the TI-Nspire™1 graphing calculator from Texas Instruments (see Figure 1).Figure 1: TI-Nspire CAS [2]Part of the latest generation of graphing calculators to be created specifically foreducational use, devices like TI-Nspire have closed the gap between what mightbe considered a calculator and what might be considered a computer (DRIJVERS& WEIGAND, 2010; KAPUT & SCHORR, 2008). These new technologies useadvances in mobile computer processors and displays to offer a range ofsoftware applications such as spreadsheet tools, dynamic geometry software andcomputer algebra systems (CAS) on relatively inexpensive handheld devices(DRIJVERS & WEIGAND, 2010). [3]To investigate the role of TI-Nspire in mathematics classrooms, I draw oneducational research related to the use of educational technology in mathematicslearning but I also draw on the field of Science and Technology Studies and inparticular Actor-Network theory (CALLON, 1986; LAW, 2002; LAW & MOL, 2001;LATOUR, 2007). Specifically, I use the theoretical tools of Actor-Network theory(ANT) to understand the relationship between humans and materials withoutovertly obscuring the role that materials play and without discounting theirpotential intrinsic educational value. Taking the ANT concept that the social iscomprised of networks of both humans and non-humans, I map the formation ofsocio-technical networks in two mathematics classrooms where TI-Nspire fromTexas Instruments is used. [4]2. Understanding the Role of Materials in Mathematics ClassroomsWithin the mathematics education research community, several researcherslooking specifically at educational technology such as TI-Nspire have suggestedapproaches to understanding the relationship between technology, teachers andstudents that avoid masking its potential role (BORBA & VILLARREAL, 2006;1 TI-Nspire™ is a registered trademark of Texas Instruments Inc. To avoid repetition thetrademark symbol is omitted for the remainder of this document.© 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld TechnologyHEGEDUS & MORENO-ARMELLA, 2010; SHAFFER & CLINTON 2006;TROUCHE & DRIJVERS, 2010; VERILLON & RABARDEL, 1995). Oneparticularly prominent view is known as the instrumental approach (LAGRANGE,1999; TROUCHE & DRIJVERS, 2010; VERILLON & RABARDEL, 1995). Fromthis perspective, learner and technology are considered to have a reciprocalrelationship and the process by which a technology becomes useful isconceptualized as a movement from tool to instrument as the learner developsschemata associated with the mathematical task that he/she uses the technologyto complete. Research drawing on the instrumental approach focuses on theways in which teachers organize the technologies available to them in theclassroom for pedagogical purposes and the ways technologies becomemeaningful in the context of mathematical activity (DRIJVERS, DOORMAN,BOON, REED & GRAVEMEIJER, 2010; TROUCHE, 2004). While theinstrumental approach foregrounds the important relationship between learnerand technology, it reduces the role of the technology to that of a mere objectwaiting to be made an instrument by learners. This understanding moves awayfrom the view that the intrinsic characteristics of a technology become transparentas it is made useful in the context of human practice but still obscures much ofthe intrinsic educational value that a material may potentially bring to aninteraction with a learner. [5]In a bid to address the problem of obscuring the potential role and intrinsic valueof materials in investigations of mathematics learning, SHAFFER and CLINTON(2005, 2006) have suggested another approach that draws on elements of ANTto conceptualize the relationship between learners and materials. In particular,SHAFFER and CLINTON (2006) take the ANT notion that when agents, whetherhuman or non-human, act within socio-technical networks the capacity to act isnot located in either party but instead emerges from their interaction (SUCHMAN,2007; LATOUR, 2007; LAW, 2002). Drawing on this notion, they assert that inrelation to computing technologies such as TI-Nspire an overt focus on thehuman side of human-technology relationships may limit understanding of therole technology plays in learning. They note that while "this may not be a problemin a theoretic culture of static inscriptional systems. In a virtual culture based onoffloading of symbolic processing, however, using human action to analyse activityobscures the active role tools play" (SHAFFER & CLINTON, 2006, p.289). [6]While the use of ANT is relatively rare in educational research, Shaffer andClinton's approach shares a number of common features with a small group ofresearchers drawing on ANT to investigate a wide range of educational topics(ROTH, 2002; FENWICK & EDWARDS, 2010; GOUGH, 2004;SAMARAWICKREMA & STACEY, 2007; SØRENSEN, 2007). A key commontheme in the approaches of these researchers is a focus on the materiality oflearning situations without assuming the agency or role of any actors whetherhuman or non-human before examining their local interactions. SØRENSEN(2007) for example, examined physical and virtual materials in primary schoolclassrooms by considering the activity between humans and materials to be arelational effect rather than focusing on the agency of any individual or group ofactors. Her analysis describes a situation where both space and time within the© 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technologyclassroom are emergent phenomena of the relationships between students,teachers and materials (SØRENSEN, 2007). [7]Beyond conceptualizing the relationships between humans and non-humanswithout making a priori assumptions about the agency of any actor, another keycommon feature in studies of learning and educational settings that draw on ANTis the combination of theoretical perspectives. Since by design ANT is more aloose set of ideas rather than a well-defined theory, many researchers choose tosimultaneously draw on other theories to inform their work. This reflects theevolving nature of ANT as a perspective on networks of social activity (FENWICK& EDWARDS, 2010). SAMARAWICKREMA and STACEY (2007), for example,drew on ROGERS' (2003) theory of diffusion of innovations in combination withANT to investigate the adoption of web-based distance learning technologies byuniversity level instructors. Using ROGERS' theory to examine the individualmotivations and actions of the instructors and ANT to understand the networks ofhumans and technology, they analyzed the cases of six Australian universities asthey adopted web-based learning technologies (SAMARAWICKREMA &STACEY, 2007). Their finding that successful adoption of technology byinstructors had little to do with general comfort with digital technology and wasinstead influenced by such factors as funding grants and faculty politics illustratesthe broad range of inquiries that ANT can be implicated in through carefulcombination with other theory. [8]SAMARAWICKREMA and STACEY's (2007) choice to work with a combination oftheoretical perspectives is common amongst educational researchers who drawon ANT (FENWICK & EDWARDS, 2010). Returning to SHAFFER andCLINTON's (2005, 2006) approach to conceptualizing the relationship betweenhumans and technology in learning situations, they also combine ANT with othertheory. In this case, SHAFFER and CLINTON draw on ANT together with activitytheory (COLE, 1998; ENGESTRÖM, 2001; LEON'TEV, 1978; NARDI, 1995;ROTH & LEE, 2007; VYGOTSKY, 1986 [1934]). This approach addresses themajor criticism that ANT lacks tools for conceptualizing the internal properties ofagents within social networks (ENGESTRÖM, 2001). To address this limitation,SHAFFER and CLINTON (2006) draw particularly on the activity theory notionthat all human action including cognition takes place within activity systems thatare mediated by tools, whether psychological or technical (LEONT'EV, 1978;VYGOTSKY, 1986 [1934]). With this conceptualization, learning is considered tobe an integral aspect of all human activity that necessarily involves tools whetheror not technical tools such as educational technologies are involved (SÄLJÖ,EKLUND & MÄKITALO, 2006). [9]3. Theoretical PerspectiveAs a theoretical perspective for this study, I follow SHAFFER and CLINTON's(2006) approach by drawing on Actor-Network theory (ANT) in combination withactivity theory. Originating with the ideas of VYGOTSKY (1986 [1934]) andLEONT'EV (1978), activity theory is a psychological approach that is particularlyconcerned with the socially and culturally situated nature of cognition. As a© 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technologysociocultural approach to understanding cognition, it, "takes as its point ofdeparture the mediated nature of human knowledge and action" (SÄLJÖ, 1999,p.151). The theory contends that all human activity takes place within systemsthat are mediated by cultural tools. These tools can be both internal orpsychological and external or technical yielding the notion that all learninginvolves tools (SÄLJÖ et al., 2006; WERTSCH, 1991). From this socioculturalperspective, tools are understood to mediate all human activity whether we noticethem or not and are recognized as the vehicles through which we make meaning(WERTSCH, 1998). This conception of tools, including technologies such as TI-Nspire, as the crucial vehicles with which we make meaning is an important partof the way learning is conceptualized in this study as tool mediated activity. [10]While both activity theory and ANT are concerned with the mediation of systemsof activity, activity theory refers to systems of human activity mediated by toolswhereas ANT speaks to networks of humans and non-humans all mediating eachother's activity. From an ANT perspective, the properties of technologies inlearning situations cannot be ignored or considered transparent since both theyand the humans that use them mediate each other (LATOUR, 2007; LAW, 2002;SHAFFER & CLINTON, 2006). Instead, ANT focuses on the ways in which socio-technical networks form as humans and non-humans interact and their practicesstabilize (LATOUR, 2007). These networks are composed of relations of network-objects themselves enacted by nested networks of humans and non-humans(LAW, 2002; LAW & MOL, 2001). In the case of this study, for example, TI-Nspireis treated as both a material object and a network-object. As a network-object it isan element of classroom socio-technical networks that is enacted through nestednetworks that include its developers, the teachers and students who use it,electronics, software, and mathematical knowledge. Network-objects such as TI-Nspire become what LATOUR (1990) refers to as "immutable" as the networksthat form them become stable. While network-objects stabilize in the context ofpatterns of relations, the networks themselves remain fluid (LATOUR, 1990). Inthis fluid space, the relations between network-objects constantly adapt as newelements emerge or existing elements reconfigure but throughout this fluidity,there is by necessity continuity. Otherwise, networks cease to remain intact, "Ifeverything is taken apart at the same time the result is rupture, the loss of shape-continuity, the loss of identity. The result is more likely to be the creation of analternative object" (LAW, 2002, p.99). In these cases, network-objects becomenew entities such as a phonebook being repurposed as a doorstop or a boltdissolving into the car it holds together. Drawing on ANT conceptions of socio-technical networks of humans and non-humans, and the activity theoryunderstanding of cognition as tool mediated activity, in this study I examineclassrooms using TI-Nspire. This examination is at a scale in which thetechnology is viewed as a network-object while recognizing that it and otherimplicated network-objects are themselves enacted through complex nestednetworks. [11]© 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technology4. MethodTo develop an understanding of the ways TI-Nspire is used in classrooms, Iobserved and interviewed two teachers who regularly include the technology aspart of their instructional practices. These teachers were chosen because theyare both fluent users of the technology who make extensive use of it in theirclassrooms but have distinct teaching and technology use backgrounds. Oneteacher is an experienced mathematics educator who has worked with graphingcalculators for more than ten years while, at the time of the study, the otherteacher was new to teaching mathematics but had a background in computerprogramming and teaching technology. Choosing teachers with a high level oftechnical literacy afforded me access to contexts where the technology wasembedded in many mathematics education practices but, by the same token,such levels of technical fluency are likely not present in most classrooms and thislimits my view of the ways TI-Nspire is used. [12]First, I conducted audio-recorded interviews using a semi-structured schedulethat focused on the teachers' use of TI-Nspire and their experiences withtechnology in the classroom. I drew on the work of MISHLER (1986, 2004) andWEISS (1995) to guide the interview process and strove for conversations thatwere informal and flexible in nature. Following these initial interviews, I observeda series of five sessions in a ninth grade class taught by each teacher. During thefive sessions in each class, I followed a complete teaching unit. In one class theunit involved the teaching of the algebraic skills necessary to perform operationssuch as simplification on binomial expressions. In the other class, the unitfocused on working with data to produce graphs and functions to model trends. Ichose to follow a complete teaching unit in each class so that I would have theopportunity to observe both when TI-Nspire was used as well as when it wasn't. Ichose ninth grade classes because in this particular school, this was the gradelevel at which students either purchased or were given a TI-Nspire handheld touse rather than only having access to the technology during class time. Thissituation offered me the interesting opportunity of observing students who wererelatively new to the technology and yet had unfettered access for developingfluency with it. [13]While observing the classes, I recorded the activity with a video camera from theback corner of the classrooms. In general, I followed the teachers with thecamera since my intention for the classroom observations was to concentrate onthe ways they included TI-Nspire in their instructional practices and situated thetechnology for their students. This focus on the teachers guided the majority ofthe in-camera editing decisions made about where to focus recording but I alsomade efforts to maintain a wide view as much as possible using panning andzooming sparingly. As DERRY et al. suggest, while a certain amount of pan andzoom may be needed to get a detailed view of activities of interest, "too muchselection at recording time may rule out later lines of analysis" (2010, p.48).Drawing on this principle while concentrating my in-camera selection decisions onthe teacher, I constantly considered the balance between recording detailedviews of teacher activities such as writing on the board or interacting with an© 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technologyindividual student and maintaining an impression of the activity in the classroomas a whole. Following each observed session, I invited the teachers to participatein debriefing interviews to help unpack the events that took place and to gainmore insight into the decisions made about when and how TI-Nspire was used. [14]Once interviews and observation had been completed, I transcribed and addedthe interview recordings and the observational videos to the qualitative analysissoftware package Transana that allows efficient organization and analysis ofmultiple media sources (WOODS & FASSNACHT, 2009). Within Transana eachrecording and transcript pair was synchronized so that sections identified in onemedium would automatically correspond with the same sections in the other (seeDEMPSTER & WOODS, 2011 for a detailed description of a similar process).This freedom to move between recording and transcript while maintainingsynchronization afforded flexibility to the analytic process during which multiplepasses of each interview and video-recording were made. While I analyzed theinterviews and observational videos, I also examined artifacts such as digitaldocuments created by the teachers to load onto TI-Nspire and worksheetscollected from the observed classrooms. [15]As an approach to the analysis of the collected multimodal data, I drew oninteraction analysis (JORDAN & HENDERSON, 1995). This approach sharesmany of the same or similar theoretical assumptions that are to be found in thisstudy. In particular, the approach assumes "that knowledge and action arefundamentally social in origin, organization, and use, and are situated in particularsocial and material ecologies" (p.41). This basic assumption is shared by bothactivity theory and ANT and forms a key element of the theoretical perspective ofthis study. From this underlying assumption, interaction analysis suggests anumber of ways of working with, in particular, video recordings to analyzeethnographic data. These methods include creating content logs that outline theactivity on a recording as soon as possible having recorded an observationalsession and conducting collaborative viewings with other researchers (JORDAN& HENDERSON, 1995). Drawing on these suggestions, I assembled content logsfollowing each interview or observed session and at least one viewing of therecordings was made in collaboration with another researcher. [16]Drawing on interaction analysis procedures in concert with the theoreticalperspective developed by the combination of ANT and activity theory, I examinedthe interviews with teachers and students for discussion of the ways theyperceive their practices to have changed in relation to TI-Nspire. Using thethemes identified from this analysis, I then examined the classroom andlunchtime activity session video-recordings along with collected artifacts forpatterns of relations between human and non-human agents that relate to theuse of TI-Nspire. This analysis drew on the work of several ANT researchersconcerned with the spatiality of socio-technical networks (LAW, 2002; LAW &MOL, 2001; SØRENSON, 2007). These researchers describe the socio-technicalnetworks that are enacted through the practices of human and non-humanagents in terms of "fluid spatiality." They suggest that the shape of socio-technical networks is constantly adapting and is never fixed but, importantly,© 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technology"while the connections which make a shape invariant in fluid space changeshape, they do so gradually and incrementally" (LAW & MOL, 2001, p.6). Payingattention to the continuity of network-objects within fluid socio-technical networks,I attended to the patterns of relations in the classrooms looking specifically forgradual formations involving TI-Nspire. I then mapped these patterns of relationsto produce a snapshot of the fluid networks as they were enacted through theactivity of the human and non-human agents in the classrooms. [17]5. FindingsFrom the analysis of the interviews, observational recordings and artifacts Iidentified and mapped patterns of socio-technical relations involving TI-Nspire.This mapping resulted in a geography of connections with three key areasrepresenting different aspects of the classroom socio-technical networks thatwere identified by participants as having adapted in relation to TI-Nspire.Figure 2: Key socio-technical network areas [18]These areas: locations of mathematical authority, locations of mathematicaltasks, and locations of mathematical activity are illustrated in Figure 2. In thefollowing sections each network area will be addressed and patterns of relationsbetween implicated network-objects in the classrooms will be discussed. [19]5.1 Locations of mathematical authorityOne key area of the classroom socio-technical networks in relation to TI-Nspirethat was identified during interviews involves locations of mathematical authorityin the classrooms. Both teacher and student participants spoke about the role ofTI-Nspire as a source of mathematical guidance and way of checking answers. Inparticular, teacher participants described students' asking TI-Nspire to answerquestions rather than coming to them, a phenomenon that they encouraged andhas been observed by a number of researchers in relation to other technologies(MONAGHAN, 2004; PIERCE, STACEY & WANDER, 2010). During a debriefing© 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technologysession, for example, one teacher spoke about how he had encouraged studentsto go to their TI-Nspire when they were stuck on a problem involving theapplication of a formula to determine the volume of a solid:"So the minute [the student] writes down the volume formula he's like 'oh is that theright one?' Like he wants to ask me, is that the right one, am I right? And we started tomake some progress at the beginning of the year, like I said 'when solving equationsdon't ask me, check [TI-Nspire], it'll tell you if its right or not'" (teacher two). [20]This practice of suggesting to students that the technology could be a source ofmathematical help and verification was also apparent during the observedclasses. Typifying the phenomenon, in one lesson that involved a period devotedto completing a worksheet in pairs, the other teacher participant instructed theclass to, "Work through it, talk with each other, use the handheld to check whatyou're thinking to see if its giving you what you expect" (teacher one). As thisteacher often did, he reminds the class that TI-Nspire can give them definitiveanswers and help them to find misconceptions in their mathematical thinking. [21]These practices reveal new patterns of relations between teacher and students interms of the sources of mathematical authority in the classroom. Speaking in aninterview about the resources students have for checking their mathematicalreasoning, one teacher noted,"They do see this [TI-Nspire] as being in the hierarchy of who you trust. Like they'lltrust the textbook, they'll trust the teacher, they'll trust the handheld right? They'll be alittle sceptical of their partners but willing to listen" (teacher one). [22]With the introduction of a technology that can provide trusted answers to a broadrange of mathematical questions, the role of the teacher as a source ofmathematical authority changes as students can turn to the technology to resolvemathematical problems or disagreements with others. [23]A network-object that directly relates to the role of the teacher and TI-Nspire interms of locations of mathematical authority is the textbook. Similar to the waystudents were encouraged to use TI-Nspire to check answers before asking theirteacher, they also tended to use the technology instead of the answer pages atthe back of their textbook. Speaking about this behavior in an interview, one ofthe teachers offered, "They've realized the limitations with the textbooks, thattheir answers are wrong in the back of the book. Well there's a certainty and atrust to this [TI-Nspire]—kind of that the answers are right" (teacher one). Theteacher indicates that he has noticed his students choosing to verify answers withTI-Nspire because it is more reliable than the back of their textbook. This practicewas observed in the classrooms with both teachers encouraging the use of thetechnology to check answers by verifying each component operation used in asolution. During one class, the same teacher described some benefits of usingTI-Nspire to verify answers telling his students:© 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technology"The back of the book lets you know if your answer is right. It doesn't necessarilyknow where your thinking went wrong ok? So you're not totally lost in space if youdon't have a TI-Nspire. If you're understanding this stuff and you're confident andyou're not making silly numeric mistakes. I want you-, Each question you do checkthe back of the book. I don't want you doing 15 questions all wrong and then realisingafter 15 you did them all wrong ok? Those of you with TI-Nspires, you don't need theback of the book. You check each transformational move that you make, so eachequivalence transformation, write it down, put it in your handheld and see what youget ok? So you'll know not only if your answer is right, you'll know if each move isappropriate" (teacher one). [24]By offering the possibility to check each step of a solution to a problem, theteacher asserts that TI-Nspire affords students much more information than thecorrect answer at the back of a textbook can provide in isolation. It can act moreas a guide than as a simple arbiter of correct answers. Reflecting this advantage,both teachers encouraged their students to work with the technology and theirtextbook by taking questions from the book but turning to TI-Nspire for guidanceabout mathematical concepts and procedures. Speaking about the benefits ofthis practice during an interview, one teacher explained:"I think the TI-Nspire allows them to play around with partial understandings muchmore comfortably than the textbook. You need to fit yourself into the correct ways thatthe textbook proposes you do things and some kids just can't find it in themselves todo that. So they can still be incorrect and playing around with their ideas and trying toresolve them with the TI-Nspire with feedback all the time. The only feedback you getwith the textbook is 'I'm wrong'" (teacher one). [25]This teacher notes that like the back of the textbook TI-Nspire can be used tocheck if an answer is correct. He asserts that unlike the back of the textbook,however, TI-Nspire is more flexible giving students more latitude to exploremathematical ideas. The teacher suggests that when students are working onquestions from their textbook, the technology becomes a partner in the activity.Similar to the relationship between teacher, student and TI-Nspire in terms oflocations of mathematical authority, the socio-technical network of student,textbook and TI-Nspire affords new possibilities for learning that would be difficultto realize with student and textbook alone. [26]5.2 Locations of mathematical tasksWe have just seen how new patterns of relations were formed with TI-Nspire as alocus of mathematical authority in the classrooms. Now we will look at the ways inwhich the mathematical tasks that were assigned to students were adapted.Speaking to such changing practices, teacher one noted that by affordingstudents a more flexible way to work through problems, TI-Nspire had changedthe types of questions he felt comfortable assigning. Talking specifically aboutassigning homework, he suggested:© 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technology"It's changed the nature of the homework that I give because if I'm assuming a kidhas access to this [TI-Nspire] at home what I can envision them doing is verydifferent than if all they have is their textbook and a notebook" (teacher one). [27]Similarly, the technology also changed the way the other teacher gaveassignments. Instead of handing out a paper worksheet or assigning questionsfrom the textbook, teacher two often created self-contained digital documentsthat he then distributed to each student's TI-Nspire (see Figure 3).Figure 3: Two pages from a teacher created TI-Nspire digital document [28]These digital documents contained pages such as those presented in Figure 3.Each page contained different elements of an activity such as instructions,questions, calculation, tables, graphing, and space for recording answers. Oncestudents had completed all the pages of an activity, the teacher could digitallycollect their work so that he could examine it on his own TI-Nspire or using acomputer based version of the technology. During an interview, the teacherexpressed a preference for this approach over the more traditional worksheet orquestions from the textbook saying:"I kind of actually prefer to have [digital documents] cause I can open them up. I don'thave to cart around like this stack of papers. I can just cart around the files, they'refairly small so whether it be on the handheld or on the computer, I can just look atwhat they've done" (teacher two). [29]While here the teacher focuses on pragmatic reasons for assigning digitaldocuments instead of using worksheets or the textbook, during a debrief after anobserved class he spoke about how using digital documents changed hisinstructional practice. Discussing a session in which students were given classtime to work with a data set that described life expectancy for males and femalesbased on year of birth, the teacher spoke about how he had approached theactivity before TI-Nspire:"What I've done before is I would have given them an instruction sheet. It's a double-sided sheet of paper. There's a graph of the men's data so they didn't actually plot thedata or use the table of values. There was the graph, it asked them to draw the line ofbest fit, it asked them to make the predictions on the data. The back side was thewomen's, draw the line of best fit, make the predictions in the data like the years orwhatever that I've used and then the end of that activity I actually had them do it on© 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technology[an earlier graphing calculator model], graph it and have the calculator determine theline of best fit and then we just compared the answers. So we said ok well this is theanswer you got, the line the calculator gave us, are they close, are they different?And then we actually from there went about talking about how to create the line andcome up with the equation using a couple of the data points" (teacher two). [30]When assigning the activity before having access to TI-Nspire, the teacher usedto ask students to graph the male and female life expectancy data sets on paperand then draw lines of best fit. Then he had students enter the data into oldergraphing calculators that do not have all the features of TI-Nspire. With thesemore basic calculators, the students then used linear regression to produce linesof best fit. The students could then compare their drawn lines of best fit to thoseproduced by the calculators. Since class time was limited and the teacher's goalwas to have students explore the concept of modeling trends in data throughlines of best fit, he did not see the approach as ideal. Graphing the data on papertook a long time but allowed students to interpret and draw their own lines of bestfit while using the older calculators for graphing took less time but did not affordstudents the chance to create their own lines of best fit. TI-Nspire, however,allows much of the manual work of data entry to be eliminated while still providingstudents the opportunity to create their own graphs and lines of best fit using itsgraphical functionality. By providing students with a digital document containingall the necessary data and instructions, the teacher was able to make what heconsidered to be much better use of the available class time while still focusingthe activity on the interpretation of data. Particularly by reducing the time requiredfor students to perform tasks, the relationship between student and TI-Nspireopens up new instructional possibilities that allow teachers and learners to focuson mathematical concepts. In response to these possibilities, new patterns ofrelations were found in the two classrooms between such network-objects as thetextbook and TI-Nspire that showed ways that the classroom socio-technicalnetworks adapted in terms of locations of mathematical tasks. [31]5.3 Locations of mathematical activityWhile TI-Nspire may open up new instructional possibilities and ways of working,it was not the only location of mathematical activity observed in the classrooms. Itwas not even the only digital technology used. In the school that this study wasconducted, the teachers had dynamic geometry software such as TheGeometers Sketchpad™, and statistical and graphing software such as Fathom™and Tinkerplots™ at their disposal. As is the case in many schools, however, thissoftware was hosted on computers in a lab that required classes to changeclassrooms. By contrast, TI-Nspire is a mobile handheld device that can be usedin any classroom but has drawbacks particularly in terms of the limited size of itsscreen and keyboard. These factors meant that the teacher participants had tochoose when to use TI-Nspire and when to use the computer lab. Discussing thisrelationship, one teacher talked about how TI-Nspire relates to the computer lab:"It's nice that there's a single tool that the kids can use for pretty much all the maththat we're doing right now. So if I can't get into the computer lab we can still do© 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld TechnologyFathom or Tinkerplots things with [TI-Nspire]. Or if we can't get in the lab and useSketchpad there are dynamic geometry things we can do with [TI-Nspire]. So the factthat you've always got a computer lab at the ready without having to book it, marchthe kids into a different location is really nice. So that this fits itself to the lesson ratherthan the lesson having to fit itself to the technology" (teacher one). [32]Because TI-Nspire is a handheld technology it is inherently more flexible than afixed computer lab in terms of where and when it can be used. As the teachernotes, it does not necessarily need to be booked and unlike computer labs whichrequire moving the class to another location can be used for a short part of alesson. During the observed classes, both teachers used TI-Nspire at times forshort periods of focused activity that might have been impractical with a computerlab. For example, guiding the class through the simplification of a polynomial bywriting on the blackboard and describing his actions, one teacher turned to TI-Nspire during a discussion with two students about what the next operationshould be. The students had different views of how the expression could beoperated upon and the teacher asked them to put it in to the technology saying,"For those of you with TI-Nspires just try putting that in and hit enter and see whatit gives you back" (teacher one). This kind of quick use of the technology wouldnot be practical if the class had to move to a computer lab. [33]Beyond having the flexibility of a handheld device that can be easily transportedand used on an ad-hoc basis during a lesson, TI-Nspire was also seen by theteachers as supporting richer mathematical conversation than traditionalcomputer labs. One teacher in particular indicated that part of his decision whenchoosing TI-Nspire over taking his class to the computer lab was informed by theidea that it's handheld nature lent itself to supporting or at least not hamperingconversation between students. He notes that, "The computer lab is a hideoussetup where kids are facing the wall around the outside and it's a bad setup forlearning, it's all about computers. The nice thing about [TI-Nspire] is it's not allabout the handhelds" (teacher one). Despite the perceived beneficial attributes ofTI-Nspire such as those the teacher refers to, many of its functions such asdynamic geometry and graphing overlap with features of software often found inschool computer labs. The very size and portability of TI-Nspire that makes ituseful in some situations may render it clumsy and difficult to use in others. Theopinions and practices of the teachers show that a relationship exists between TI-Nspire and the computer lab. While in many cases TI-Nspire was chosen over thecomputer lab, it did not totally replace it and the socio-technical networks in theclassrooms adapted to accommodate both technologies. [34]Another digital technology in the classroom that has a relationship with TI-Nspirein terms of locations of mathematical activity is the interactive whiteboard. Itdisplays a projected computer screen and allows users to interact by touchingand writing directly on the image. Teachers can project a computer softwareemulator version of TI-Nspire onto an interactive whiteboard and then manipulatea large image of the handheld (see Figure 4).© 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld TechnologyFigure 4: Teacher using interactive whiteboard with TI-Nspire [35]Despite this feature of interactive whiteboards that allow users to manipulate alarge projected version of TI-Nspire, in one of the observed classrooms theteacher preferred to use a blackboard as the primary location of sharedmathematical activity. In this classroom, the blackboard was used in combinationwith TI-Nspire and the translation of mathematical notation between thetechnology and backboard was a key component of most of the observedsessions. This teacher described how he had at first frequently used aninteractive whiteboard when he first introduced TI-Nspire to his classes but thenchanged his practice saying,"I used it a lot at first. I quite enjoyed using it, I use it less now. I don't like to use it asdemo because as soon as the lights go off its like it's a movie and the kids are justlike this [sits back in chair and folds arms]" (teacher one). [36]In the other classroom, an interactive whiteboard was often used in combinationwith TI-Nspire instead of the blackboard. It was the primary location of sharedmathematical activity in this classroom and was integral to the way TI-Nspire wasused. Describing his rationale for the arrangement, the teacher described, "It isso important for them [the students] to be able to have access to it [the interactivewhiteboard] to be able to follow along. It just makes it a lot smoother" (teachertwo). By using an interactive whiteboard in combination with TI-Nspire, theteacher demonstrated ways of working and discussed activities that in his classwere almost always assigned as self-contained digital documents. In addition,students could and often did come up to the front of the class and share waysthey had approached problems or ways of working with TI-Nspire. For example,during an observed session the teacher asked a student to use the interactivewhiteboard to show the class how she arrived at a solution to a problem:© 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld TechnologyTeacher says:Student inputs:TI-Nspire returns:Teacher says:Student inputs:TI-Nspire returns:Teacher says:Go head punch it in on my calculator. As [student] punches it inI'm going to describe what she's doing.All right so the very first thing is just to enter the formula andagain it did simplify for us because six divided by three is two.So the next step [student] did was to divide by two and she'sgot 50 is equal to pi times r squared. [37]Thus, using the TI-Nspire projected on the interactive whiteboard, the studentwas able to replicate the work she had done on her handheld. This allowed theclass to discuss her approach to solving the problem without having to work witha mediator such as a blackboard that would require them to translate between TI-Nspire mathematical representations and hand-written forms. [38]A theme that runs through the patterns of relations between TI-Nspire and othernetwork-objects such as the blackboard and interactive whiteboard in terms oflocations of mathematical activity is the crucial connection between thetechnology and paper/pencil work. The importance of this relationship is alsoindicated by the large amount of mathematics education research that focusesupon the interaction between technological and paper/pencil mathematical activity(ARTIGUE, 2002; CHAPPEL & KILLPATRICK, 2003; DRIJVERS & KIERAN,2006; KIERAN & SALDANA, 2005; TALL, SMITH & PIEZ, 2008). In the observedclassrooms, students worked with both paper/pencil and TI-Nspire collaboratively.There were, however, marked differences between classes that relate directly tothe use of such network-objects as paper worksheets, textbooks, self-containeddigital documents, blackboards, and interactive whiteboards. In the class whereassignments were most often given via paper worksheets and the blackboardwas the primary medium for sharing with the group, students tended to workpredominately with paper/pencil with TI-Nspire acting as a partner in theiractivities. In the class where most assignments involved self-contained digital© 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technologydocuments and sharing with the group took place on an interactive whiteboard,TI-Nspire tended to be the focus of student mathematical activity. [39]Each teacher had distinct impressions of how TI-Nspire and paper/pencil couldbe useful as parts of their instructional practices. As is the case with many of thepedagogical views teachers have, these intentions shaped the role thetechnology had in their classrooms (PIERCE, BALL & STACEY, 2009). Duringinterviews one teacher in particular spoke often about resisting the technologybecoming the focus during lessons. Discussing his choice not to find or createdigital documents and distribute them to his students, he explained:"The documents I haven't used as much as I thought I would. And I don't think itsbecause there aren't documents out there that are good. It's just that I don't want it tobe about the documents, the lessons or the handheld. You know I would prefer it tobe in the background and the kids grab it when they need it" (teacher one). [40]This teacher believed strongly that TI-Nspire should be one of many toolsavailable to students but that most mathematical activity should be onpaper/pencil. Sharing the view of a number of mathematics educationresearchers (DRIJVERS, 2000; PIMM, 1995; STACEY, 1997), that handing-offprocedural tasks to technology may actually make conceptualizing mathematicalconcepts more difficult, the teacher also expressed concern about TI-Nspirebecoming a black-box. He described his fear of TI-Nspire becoming an opaquecomputational machine into which problems go and solutions come out withoutany indication of the processes that have been performed. This motivated him tode-emphasize the importance of the technology in his classroom, insteadchoosing to focus mathematical activity on paper/pencil. [41]The other teacher whose class was observed, had a distinctly different view andspoke most often about the advantages of TI-Nspire being the primary location ofmathematical activity. Speaking during a debriefing session about a class inwhich he had asked students to create a number of graphs so that they could becompared, he offered:"I don't think I would have got that discussion necessarily about the different points ofintersection for the male and female [datasets] today if I didn't have the technology.Cause what would have happened is with, I don't know what did we have there 20data points, some of the kids it would take them half an hour to graph 20 data points.So by the time they get the one graph created and we get that line drawn that'salmost the entire period right? So you can spend a period let's say creating graphsbut now if you want to get through the graphs and just do talking about it andanalysing it and comparing it, it's so much easier to do in an instant have the graphand now let's discuss" (teacher two) [42]For this teacher, TI-Nspire made it possible to have more discussion and toaddress more concepts than would be possible with paper/pencil. He saw theseadvantages as outweighing concerns of black-box effects or the technologybecoming the focus of mathematical activity. In his classroom, the primary© 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technologylocation of mathematical activity was TI-Nspire with the role of paper/pencilgreatly reduced even to the point that students often took notes on thetechnology. This arrangement of the technology and paper/pencil is distinctlydifferent to the arrangement preferred in the other teacher's class and showssome of the range of ways that socio-technical networks form in relation to TI-Nspire and locations of mathematical activity. [43]6. DiscussionBy examining the activity in classrooms where TI-Nspire is used, the findings ofthis study illuminate ways that patterns of relations between teachers, studentsand classroom materials adapt with the introduction of handheld technologies.While only those adapted relations that participants expressed in their interviewswere discussed, this subset of the enormously complex set of mediators inclassrooms where handheld technologies are used shows theinterconnectedness of network-objects such as the teacher, the textbook,worksheets, the computer lab, the board, paper/pencil, handheld technology andstudents. In Figure 5, the connections between these network-objects that wereidentified as having formed in relation to TI-Nspire are illustrated.Figure 5: Geography of classroom socio-technical networks involving TI-Nspire [44]This diagram represents a snapshot of the fluid networks in the two classroomsand the network-objects within them. It shows not only the interconnectedness ofthe socio-technical networks but also the overlapping roles of the network-objectswithin them. The humans and materials identified in the diagram fall within threeoverlapping areas that represent the roles they play in classrooms. While anagent such as the teacher, for example, plays a much greater role within theclassroom than just being a location of mathematical authority, this is the role© 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technologyidentified in terms of the networks formed in the two classrooms in relation to TI-Nspire. [45]The teacher was not the only agent of the socio-technical networks in the twoobserved classrooms that acted as a location of mathematical authority. Theanswers at the back of the textbook, software in the computer lab and TI-Nspirealso acted as locations of mathematical authority for students to draw on. Thischanged the relationship between teacher and student, allowing students toexplore their thinking further before asking the teacher for help. PIERCE et al.(2010) also found evidence of shifts in locations of mathematical authority inrelation to the introduction of TI-Nspire. They assert that technology capable ofbeing a source of mathematical authority changes the didactic contract betweenteacher and student and shifts socio-mathematical norms in the classroom(PIERCE et al., 2010). While they speak to the changed relationship betweenteacher and student in terms of locations of mathematical authority with theintroduction of TI-Nspire, the present study adds to this work by identifying otherimportant relationships within classroom socio-technical networks that are alsoimplicated. The textbook in particular, was identified as also acting as a locationof mathematical authority whose relationship with students shifted in relation toTI-Nspire. [46]While the textbook was identified as a location of mathematical authority in thetwo observed classrooms, it also served as a location of mathematical tasks.Along with paper worksheets, the blackboard and interactive whiteboard anddigital documents on TI-Nspire, the textbook acted as a way mathematical taskswere assigned to students. Each of these network-objects afforded the teachersdifferent possibilities in terms of the kinds of tasks they could assign with thenetwork of TI-Nspire and student having distinctly different properties to studentand textbook. DRIJVERS and KIERAN (2006) have also spoken to therelationship between technology and the kinds of tasks assigned to students.They assert that when a student undertakes a mathematical task with a computeralgebra system there exists a dialectical relationship between that task and thetechnique they use from which mathematical theorizing emerges (DRIJVERS &KIERAN, 2006; see also KIERAN & SALDANA, 2005). This speaks to theinterrelated nature of materials available to students and the kinds of tasks thatcan be assigned. Findings drawn from the two observed classrooms in this studysupport DRIJVERS and KIERAN's assertion by suggesting the introduction of TI-Nspire certainly influences the kinds of tasks assigned to students but, inaddition, suggest that it influences the relationships between teacher, student andother network elements such as paper worksheets and the blackboard andinteractive whiteboard. [47]Apart from being implicated as a medium for assigning tasks, the blackboard andinteractive whiteboard also acted as a location of mathematical activity in theclassrooms. Together with the computer lab, paper/pencil and TI-Nspirehandhelds, the blackboard and interactive whiteboard served as locations of bothindividual and shared mathematical activity. While none of these locationsreplaced any of the others, they were all involved to greater or lesser extents in© 2011 FQS http://www.qualitative-research.net/FQS 13(1), Art. 12, Thomas Hillman: A Geography of Connections:Networks of Humans and Materials in Mathematics Classrooms Using Handheld Technologythe mathematical activity of each classroom. The student, teacher, board,paper/pencil, computer software, and TI-Nspire were arranged in different wayswith each configuration supporting different activity. As several researchers havesuggested, in terms of learning perhaps what is most important is that multiplelocations of mathematical activity were available for students to work and sharewith (DRIJVERS & KIERAN, 2006; KIERAN & SALDANA, 2005). [48]During the course of this study, I was particularly struck by the relationshipbetween the activity students engage in individually and activity shared by thewhole class by means of a blackboard or interactive whiteboard. I found that thematerials that participate in this relationship have a distinct role in mediatingmathematical activity and that the interaction between students and materials inone location had a particular influence on the other and vice versa. In the case ofthis study, the materials were most often paper and pencil and TI-Nspire forprivate activity, and blackboard and interactive whiteboard for public activity. Thecomplexity of the relationships among these materials, students and teachers asthey engaged in mathematical activity that I found in this study indicates thatmore focused research with other materials and in other settings would help tofurther our understanding of this important aspect of classroom practice. [49]By taking an ANT approach that required me to attend to the interactionsbetween humans and non-humans in the classrooms while consciously trying tolimit a priori judgments about their roles and agency and by working with bothinterviews and video-recorded observational data, the findings of this studyindicate that socio-technical networks in classrooms using handheld technologyoperate as a complex interconnected whole. From interactional analysis of thevideo recordings of the two classrooms, it is particularly evident that the effects ofthe teachers' decisions to include TI-Nspire as part of their instructional practiceswere not limited to, for instance, the local patterns of relations between studentand technology while completing an activity. These interactions are insteadextremely broad, influencing practices as diverse as homework and the use of thecomputer lab. The findings of this study show as DRIJVERS et al. (2010)suggest, that the didactical configuration of technologies in mathematicsclassrooms has a profound effect on the mathematical practices within them butalso suggest that this is far from a one-way phenomenon. While teachers haveenormous influence through their choices of what technological arrangements touse, other agents both human and non-human in the classroom mediate theseconfigurations and are highly interrelated. For instance, the choice to assignactivities as digital documents rather than as questions from the textbook mayinfluence the decision to share mathematical activity as a class with an interactivewhiteboard and may influence the decision to create digital notes rather thanwork with paper/pencil. Each pattern of socio-technical relations mediates theothers and together they reciprocally shape the geography of the classroom.
