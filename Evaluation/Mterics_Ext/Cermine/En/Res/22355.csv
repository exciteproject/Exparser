Time Perspective and Correlatesof WellbeingLisa Drake, Elaine Duncan, Fi Sutherland,Clare Abernethy and Colette HenryABSTRACT. This study investigated correlates of five time per-spectives (TPs) and the Balanced Time Perspective (BTP) constructproposed by Zimbardo and colleagues. Two hundred and sixtyScottish participants completed the Zimbardo Time PerspectiveInventory (ZTPI: Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999), Subjective HappinessScale (Lyubomirsky and Lepper, 1999) and Mindful AttentionAwareness Scale (Brown and Ryan, 2003). The most prevalent TPprofile was moderate to high scores on all five TPs of the ZTPI. BTPparticipants were significantly happier and more mindful. Happinessand mindfulness were positively correlated but a future TP did notcorrelate with subjective happiness.

Indeed, Suddendorf and Corballis (1997) noted that themonitoring of time underpinned cognitive functioning. Thus learning to dealwith time, at both a subjective and objective level, is vital. Since time does notexist independently of the person and is in fact a psychological construct, then itis one that the person continually identifies with and refines (Block, 1990).Gonzalez and Zimbardo (1985) believed that the way in which we seek toTime & Society copyright © 2008 SAGE (Los Angeles, London, New Delhi and Singapore)VOL. 17 No. 1 (2008), pp. 47–61 0961-463X DOI: 10.1177/0961463X07086304www.sagepublications.com48TIME & SOCIETY 17(1)separate and apportion, or encircle chunks of time is a powerful and pervasivecharacteristic of the human experience.As the interest in studying time has increased so too has the terminologyresearchers use to describe its various facets. This hasn’t necessarily led toconfusion but some blurring of concepts and constructs related to the study oftime do exist (Wallace and Rabin, 1960; Hoornaert, 1973; Hulbert and Lens,1988; Nuttin, 1985). Time attitude, time perspective, temporal orientation, andtime perception are often synonymous with each other and interchangeable(Hulbert and Lens, 1988). Other terms such as sense of time, subjective experi-ence and temporal experience all point to the notion that individuals are awareof the passing of time and may crudely divide time into frames or periods. Whiletime attitude is the affective response (positive or negative) towards past, pre-sent or future time frames (Nuttin, 1985) time orientation is concerned withdetermining which of these time frames an individual tends to favour (DeVolder, 1979). Nuttin (1985) defines time perception as judging the passage oftime itself but sees time perspective as a complex construct of four sub-factors,namely extension, structuralization, and realism that can be applied to both pastand future perspectives (see Nuttin, 1985 for more detail on factors).The present article does not disagree with these definitions but chooses tofocus on how Zimbardo and colleagues define and operationalize TP. That isthat TP is ‘the manner in which individuals, and cultures, partition the flow ofhuman experience into distinct temporal categories of past, present and future’(Zimbardo et al., 1997: 1008). Zimbardo and colleagues also sought to investi-gate these past, present and future time frames more thoroughly by developing ascale to measure TP, namely the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI).Here the past, present and future temporal frames are subdivided into five sub-scales. These are, firstly, the Past Negative (PN) temporal frame. This reflects apessimistic attitude towards the past and possibly the experience of traumaticlife events. Secondly, the Past Positive (PP), which is marked by a moresentimental and positive view of one’s past. Thirdly, Present Hedonistic (PH),associated with the desire for spontaneous pleasure with slight regard to risk orconcern for future consequences. Then there is the Present Fatalistic (PF) framewhich is defined as a lack of hope for the future and belief that uncontrollableforces determine one’s fate. The fifth and final dimension, the Future (F), ischaracterized by reward dependence that occurs as a result of achieving specificlong-term goals.Time Perspective and Wellbeing ResearchResearch thus far suggests that particular temporal frames have implicationsfor various aspects of wellbeing. For example, PN has been correlated withDRAKE ET AL.: TIME PERSPECTIVE AND CORRELATES OF WELLBEING49depression, anxiety and low self-esteem, and it has been demonstrated that PNindividuals have fewer close friends (Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999), gamble more(Wassarman, 2002) and are more likely to be in alcohol and drug programmes(Klingeman, 2001) than those in other TP groups. Findings from Lyubomirskyand Nolen-Hoeksema (1995) and Nolen-Hoeksema and Morrow (1993) confirmthis. In contrast, high PP scores are related to high levels of self-esteem andhappiness (Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999), agreeableness and energy (Goldberg andMaslach, 1996) and indicative of the use of social support networks (Holmanand Zimbardo, 1999, cited in Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999). Present oriented (PHand PF) individuals are less influenced by safe sex practices (Rothspan andRead, 1996) and tend to engage in risky driving (Zimbardo et al., 1997),alcohol and drug misuse (Strathman et al., 1994; Keough et al., 1999) and sufferchronic homelessness (Epel et al., 1999). However, moderate scores for the PHfactor, which have been positively correlated with novelty and sensation seek-ing, can be beneficial for the individual provided they have some concept offuture consequences (Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999).The Future sub-scale has been associated with less psychopathy (Wallace,1956, cited in Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999), and positively correlated with partici-pation in a cancer-screening programme (Guarino et al., 1999). It is thereforeregarded as the more constructive time perspective in terms of engaging inpositive health behaviours. According to Kazakina (1999, cited in Zimbardoand Boyd, 1999), individuals with a more future-oriented outlook are moreoptimistic and anticipate positive outcomes. This can, in itself, perpetuate morepositive functioning and can lead to higher levels of academic achievement(Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999), elevated levels of participation in research studies(Harber et al., 2003), success in prison training programmes (Chubick et al.,1999) and more adaptive coping strategies for obtaining shelter when homeless(Epel et al., 1999). It has, however, been suggested that an overemphasis onfuture goals compromises spontaneity resulting in poor ability to ‘switch off’and enjoy the present (Boniwell and Zimbardo, 2003). Similarly an over-emphasis, or a temporal bias, towards a present orientation is associated withnegative emotions, such as anger, anxiety and depression (Wills et al.,, 2001),alcohol use, smoking and illegal drug use (Keough et al., 1999; Wills et al.,2001) and engaging in risky sexual practises (Rothspan and Read, 1996).Despite some findings suggesting that a focus on the present is associated withsubjective wellbeing and general happiness (Csikszentmihalyi, 1992; Keough,et al., 1999) it seems that seeking immediate gratification, while disregardingthe consequences of actions, is typical of a predisposition to a present temporalbias.To facilitate wellbeing Boniwell and Zimbardo (2004) propose that oneshould strive to achieve what they call a Balanced Time Perspective (BTP). Thisis characterized, statistically, as moderate to high scores for the PP, PH, and F50TIME & SOCIETY 17(1)factors and relatively low scores for the PN and PF factors. It is operationallydefined as the ability to hold past present and future time perspectives concur-rently but importantly to be able to move between each perspective and to usethe most appropriate one in a given situation. Zimbardo and Boyd (1999) go asfar as to suggest that a BTP is central to optimal functioning. By that they meanthat the individual will reap psychological benefits if they are able to ‘work hardwhen there is a mission to be accomplished, but play hard when the work isdone’ (Zimbardo, 2002: 62). By achieving a BTP an individual’s actions areshaped by a consideration of all three temporal zones (Zimbardo and Boyd,1999; Boniwell and Zimbardo, 2003, 2004) as opposed to the limiting ability ofa dispositional bias towards one particular time frame. Accordingly, Boniwelland Zimbardo (2004) propose that individuals with a BTP will be happier thanthose who do not have a BTP. However, most TP research has yet to establishthis. Most of the research has focused on specific temporal frames using variedTP measurements rather than focusing on the BTP construct. For example,Kazakina (1999, cited in Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999) found positive correlationsbetween a present orientation and positive affect and between a past positive ori-entation and life satisfaction. There is also evidence of positive relationshipsbetween present orientation and general happiness (Kammann and Flett, 1983),life satisfaction (Diener et al., 1985) and optimism (Lennings, 2000). Similarily,Zaleski et al. (2001) showed that a future perspective was positively associatedwith subjective wellbeing. However, a future orientation is positively correlatedwith higher socio-economic status, which is only weakly related to wellbeing(Diener, 2000). Assessing subjective wellbeing has been done in many ways(e.g. Diener, 1997; Peterson, 2000) and there are numerous constructs that relateto subjective wellbeing. For the purposes of the present study we chose to focuson a global, subjective assessment of happiness. Thus the present study used theSubjective Happiness Scale (Lyubomirsky & Lepper, 1999). This simply askspeople to evaluate how happy or unhappy they are and does not involve cogni-tive evaluations of the quality of, or satisfaction with, life (Lyubomirsky, 2001).The notion that a BTP allows the individual to be more fully engaged in anygiven situation corresponds with an aspect of consciousness called mindfulness.Mindfulness, according to Hanh (1976) facilitates conscious awareness of thereality of the present. Brown and Ryan (2003) investigated mindfulness as anindividual differences attribute by adopting the Mindfulness AttentionAwareness Scale (MAAS). The study demonstrated significant positive correla-tions between mindfulness and self-esteem, optimism, life satisfaction, andwellbeing, and negative correlations with neuroticism, anxiety and depression.DRAKE ET AL.: TIME PERSPECTIVE AND CORRELATES OF WELLBEING51Aims of the Present StudyThus the aims of the present study were first, to operationalize the five TPs ofthe ZTPI and establish what relationship there is between these five temporalframes and subjective happiness. It is important that the measurement of happi-ness chosen for this study is asking for a simple judgement of how happy orunhappy participants feel which is in contrast to other studies that have usedmore global judgements of life satisfaction. Second, the BTP construct will alsobe operationalized to establish what relationship, if any, having a BTP has withsubjective happiness scores. Third, to investigate to what extent mindfulnessrelates to each of the TPs and the BTP construct. Since mindfulness is synony-mous with conscious absorption in the present then positive correlationsbetween particular TPs and the BTP should be evident. Thus the study will seekto validate assumptions of the TP theory and the BTP construct as viewed byZimbardo and colleagues.On the basis of findings from previous research several hypotheses wereproposed. First, that those participants with a BTP profile would be more mind-ful and happier than those not achieving a BTP profile (scores spread acrossthe other five temporal factors of the ZTPI). Second, that PP and F would bepositively correlated with mindfulness, while PN and PF orientations would benegatively correlated with mindfulness. Further, given that high scores on thePH scale are associated with risky activities and thrill seeking (Boniwell andZimbardo, 2004), which would be considered unmindful behaviour, it waspredicted that there would be a negative correlation between PH and mindful-ness. It was also hypothesized that PP, PH and F would be positively relatedto subjective happiness, but that PN and PF would be negatively related tohappiness. Finally, based on Brown and Ryan’s (2003) findings it was predictedthat mindfulness and subjective happiness would be positively correlated.MethodDesignA correlational questionnaire-based design was used. The dependent variableswere participants’ scores on the ZTPI, comprising five sub-scales; past negative(PN), present hedonistic (PH), future (F), past positive (PP) and present fatalis-tic (PF), the MAAS and subjective happiness scores.ParticipantsTwo hundred and sixty participants, 170 male and 90 female, ranging in agefrom 16 to 83, completed the study. Participants were recruited via the adoption52TIME & SOCIETY 17(1)of opportunity and snowball sampling methodology and consisted of students atthe Glasgow Caledonian University (UK), family, friends and associates of theresearch team. The sample was thus drawn from a wider age range and livingcircumstances than an exclusively university-based sample.MaterialsThe questionnaire consisted of demographic items ascertaining age and genderand the following inventories.Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI: Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999):this is a 56-item self-report instrument, with five sub-scales as described previ-ously, which measures participants’ time-related attitudes and behaviour by ask-ing them to rate, on a Likert scale, how true each statement is of them (1 being‘very untrue’ and 5 being’ very true). The scale was developed from casestudies, surveys and factor analysis and has shown reliability, validity and easeof administration (Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999).Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS: Lyubomirsky and Lepper, 1999): this is afour-item self-report scale used to measure global subjective happiness. Twoitems require participants to produce absolute measures of happiness withregard to their own rating and that relative to peers. A further two questions askparticipants to rate to what extent descriptions of unhappy and happy people aretypical of them. All items are measured on a 7-point Likert scale and an averagescore is taken across the four scores, with the fourth item being reverse-coded.Higher scores reflect higher levels of subjective happiness.Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS: Brown and Ryan, 2003):this is a 15-item scale that assesses individual differences in the frequency ofmindfulness states by asking participants to rate how frequently or infrequentlyeach experience happens to them. It also utilizes a Likert scale where 1 repre-sents ‘almost always’ through to 6 which represents ‘almost never’.ProcedureA pilot study ensured that the questionnaires were feasible and easy to follow.The battery of questionnaires were then distributed using opportunity samplingand snowballing techniques. Written instructions informed participants that itwould take approximately 10–15 minutes to complete. Participants were given a14-day period within which to complete and return the battery of questionnairesto a secure central point. Confidentiality was guaranteed. No payment or anyother incentive was offered.DRAKE ET AL.: TIME PERSPECTIVE AND CORRELATES OF WELLBEING53ResultsResults pertaining to the number of participants holding a BTP profile will begiven first. These individuals were then tested against those with non-BTPprofiles (the other five temporal frames) in terms of subjective happiness andmindfulness. A further analysis will concentrate on correlations between sub-jective happiness, mindfulness and the five temporal frames themselves.How many participants achieved a BTP?To calculate this, low, moderate and high TP scores were obtained by dividing TPscores for each of the five factors as close as possible to the 33rd and 66thpercentiles, resulting in three groups. Applying Zimbardo’s theory that lowscores on PN and PF, moderate to high on PP, F and PH constitute a BTP, wecould calculate that only 13 participants (10 females and 3 males) achieved a BTP.BTP and subjective happinessTable 1 shows means and standard deviations for SHS scores across two levelsof TP profile. Group 1 (n = 247) represents those participants who did not havea BTP profile. Group 2 (n = 13) represents those who did. As can be seen fromTable 1 the group with a BTP profile scored significantly higher on the SHS thanthose with other TP profiles (t = 5.04, df = 12, p = .0001). Thus the hypothesisthat happiness scores would differ significantly between those with a BTPprofile and those without was supported.TABLE 1Descriptive statistics for SHS and MAAS scores across two levels of TP profileHappinessMindfulnessGroup 1*Group 2**Group 1Group 2* Participants who did not have BTP.** Participants with a BTP.BTP and mindfulnessN2471324713mean4.034.414.915.52standard deviation.772.5211.050.44Table 1 also shows the means and standard deviations for MAAS scores acrossthe same two levels of TP profile as above. As can be seen from Table 1 the54TIME & SOCIETY 17(1)group with the BTP profile did indeed score significantly higher on mindfulnessthan those with other TP profiles (t = 2.63, df = 12, p = .011). Thus the hypoth-esis that mindfulness scores would differ significantly between those with aBTP profile and those without was supported.The five temporal frames and their relationship to subjective happinessThe correlation matrix (Table 2, next page) shows there was no significant rela-tionship between the F and PF time perspectives and subjective happiness (F, r= –.074; PF, r = –.0.97). However, PH and PP were significantly correlated withhappiness. For PH and PP, the relationship was positive (PH, r = .155, p < 0.01;PP, r = .214, p < 0.001). The PN factor was negatively correlated withhappiness (r = –.416, p < .001). As this result accounted for 17 per cent ofthe variance, there was a relatively strong tendency for individuals with apessimistic view of the past to score low on the happiness scale.The five temporal frames and mindfulnessThe five temporal frames (PN, PH, F, PP and PF) were correlated with mindful-ness. Table 2 shows there were no significant correlations between F and mind-fulness (r = .027). However, PP, PN, PH and PF related significantly tomindfulness. For PP, the relationship was positive (R = .125, p < 0.5), account-ing for 2 per cent of the variance and indicating a weak tendency for those witha high PP score to be more mindful. For PN, the relationship was negative (r =–.492, p < 0.001), accounting for 24 per cent of the variance, indicating thatthose who score high in PN have a moderate tendency to be less mindful. For PFand PH, the relationship was also negative (PF, r = –.23, p < 0.001; PH, r =–.116, p < 0.05), accounting for 5 and 1 per cent of the variance respectively andindicating that there is a weak tendency for those with high PF and PH scores tobe low in mindfulness.DiscussionThe present study operationalized the five temporal frames of the ZTPI andestablished what relationship there was between these and self-reported subjec-tive happiness. Moreover, the relationship between a BTP and subjective happi-ness scores was investigated and compared to the five non-BTP temporal framesor time perspectives. In addition, the extent to which mindfulness related to eachof the temporal frames and the BTP construct was clarified. It was proposed thatindividuals with a BTP would be happier and more mindful than those withother profiles. The results did indeed show that 13 individuals matched theDRAKE ET AL.: TIME PERSPECTIVE AND CORRELATES OF WELLBEING55TABLE 2Correlation matrix for five time perspective factors, mindfulness andsubjective happinessPNPHFPPPFMindfulnessMindfulness–.492***–.116*.027.125*–.230***1.000Happiness–.416***–.155**–.074.214***–.097.330**** Correlation is significant at the 0.05 level (1-tailed).** Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (1-tailed).*** Correlation is significant at the 0.0001 level (1-tailed).criteria for a BTP. Analysis of the BTP group compared to those with otherprofiles showed that those with a BTP had significantly higher mean scores forsubjective happiness and mindfulness than individuals with other TP profiles.However, this study found that the most prevalent temporal frame profileconstituted individuals with moderate to high scores in all five of the frames(n = 43). These individuals set themselves apart from the BTP group by havingmoderate to high scores in the risk factors of past negative and present fatalistic.An analysis of the five temporal frames in relation to happiness and mindful-ness was also carried out. It was hypothesized that the PH- and PP-subjectivehappiness relationship would be positive and that the PN-subjective happinesscorrelation be negative. These hypotheses were indeed confirmed and allow usto state that the happier participants were those more likely to hold positive asopposed to negative attitudes towards their past, be more spontaneous and livemore in the moment.Rather surprisingly the F factor was not significantly correlated with subjec-tive happiness. A future orientation is apparently linked to positive functioning(Kazakina, 1999), participation in health screening (Guarino et al., 1999) andless psychopathy (Wallace, 1956). It follows then that this would link tohigher levels of subjective happiness. However, it has to be acknowledged thatthere is some degree of ambiguity in research findings between time perspec-tives and wellbeing. Despite the links with higher optimism (Zimbardo andRyan, 1999), self-efficacy, and more adaptive coping strategies (Epel et al.,1999) one should temper these findings by bearing in mind that Boniwell andZimbardo (2003) have suggested that an emphasis on achieving future goalsmay compromise the level of enjoyment in present activities and the importanceof family values at the root of our own past. The present authors propose that an56TIME & SOCIETY 17(1)emphasis on future goals not only pulls people away from absorption in presentreality but could also create more anxiety and hurriedness. It is also the case thatone should take into account how future-oriented people would feel if goals andplans are thwarted by current obstacles. Further investigations of the phenome-nology of the future orientation is warranted.It was expected that the PF sub-scale would be negatively correlated withsubjective happiness. It is not surprising that this aspect has been supportedsince PF is said to be the most destructive factor as it has been associated withhigher levels of aggression, anxiety and depression (Zimbardo and Boyd, 1999).A fatalistic frame of the present does not however preclude concern for futureconsequences. For example, in relation to health-promoting behaviour Hamiltonet al. (2003) found that a present orientation was not negatively correlated tosuch behaviour.It is our belief that this is the first study to test mindfulness in relation to timeperspective. It was hypothesized that if mindfulness represents awareness andthe keeping of conscious thoughts in the present then one would expect thatthose high on mindfulness are first, happier and second, possess particular timeperspectives relevant to the mindfulness state. It may be that these people,thanks to the mindfulness state, possess more ability to balance work, leisureand family demands and may be more likely to possess a BTP profile. Thus itwas hypothesized that mindfulness scores would differ significantly acrossthose with a BTP profile and those without. Indeed the results showed that theBTP group participants did score significantly higher on mindfulness than thosewith other TP profiles. As predicted, certain temporal frames were related toMAAS scores. As predicted the PP-MAAS correlation was positive, while thePN-, PH- and PF-MAAS relationships were negative. However, the associationbetween the future temporal frame and MAAS scores though positive was notsignificant. Overall we can say that those who were more mindful tended to havea more favourable perception of the past and towards life in general. Examiningrelationships between the ZTPI and MAAS and finding that PP-MAAS correla-tions were in the predicted direction offers some validation for PP factor of theZTPI itself.Limitations and Future ConsiderationsIt has to be acknowledged that the correlational nature of the research designprecludes even the slightest speculation on causal connections or underlyingmechanisms between a BTP, the other temporal frames, and wellbeing.However, the fact that those with a BTP showed higher levels of aspects of well-being supports basic tenets of the BTP construct. This study, we believe, is thefirst to attempt a BTP profile analysis and as such presents evidence in supportDRAKE ET AL.: TIME PERSPECTIVE AND CORRELATES OF WELLBEING57of the Zimbardo and Boyd’s (1999) BTP theory. However, these findings shouldbe regarded as preliminary. A replication study seeking to capture more indi-viduals with a BTP profile would be a prudent next step. Since ethics stipulatedthat anonymity be afforded each participant in the present study, in depth inter-views with those with a BTP were not possible. We therefore suggest that futurestudies consider case study analyses of those found to have a BTP. This wouldallow extension of the theory and operationalization of it within a practicalsetting.The PP–subjective happiness correlation was the highest positive result of allthe time perspectives and subjective happiness scores. These findings are in linewith previous research on the happiness and time perspective (Kammann andFlett, 1983; Lennings, 2000; Boniwell and Zimbardo, 2004). That a positiverelationship was found is accepted but it is only a relationship and in no wayconstitutes a causal explanation nor indicates underlying mechanisms. In additionthe present study did not take into account participants’ past positive and/ornegative life events. Thus we have no understanding of context that may havecontributed to decisions made by participants when they were completing thequestionnaires. Future research should attempt to ascertain exposure topast negative and positive life events as mediators. Better still would be an appre-ciation of coping mechanisms in those with a PP profile alongside a personalitymeasure. Individual difference data such as this can inform theory and possiblyinterventions aimed at altering temporal frames to maximise positive functioningand wellbeing.It is important to point out that results here could be influenced by themeasurement of happiness chosen. Equivocal results may be produced becausedifferent surveys adopt different interpretations of the subjective wellbeing con-struct. The adoption of the SHS scale in this study was a deliberate attemptto use a global measure that measured simply how happy or unhappy peopleperceived themselves to be. Since measures of wellbeing assess either cognitiveor the emotional components of the construct, the present authors argue thatsimplification was needed here. Notwithstanding this, it would be interesting toprobe the emotional components with respect to time perspective more purpose-fully. For example, studies could perhaps use such measures as the Positive andNegative Affect Scale (PANAS: Watson et al., 1988) and/or adopt the EmotionDiary (Oatley and Duncan, 1994; Duncan and Grazzani-Gavazzi, 2004) orExperience Sampling Methodologies. Such strategies would place scores ontime perspective scales in context. These would be most appropriate in a studythat aimed to investigate possible changes in the five factors across time.The extent to which these results are generalizable must be treated withcaution even though steps were taken to widen recruitment beyond the studentpopulation and to use a wide age range. We did not feel that there were sufficientnumbers in particular age categories to be able to take a look at developmental58TIME & SOCIETY 17(1)changes in time perspectives. This would be an important next step for futureresearch. Some consideration should also be given to the cultural context withinwhich this investigation took place. In this Scottish sample it was found that asubstantial number presented scores that indicated the predominance of pastnegative and present fatalistic outlooks. The intriguing question is whether thisis serendipitous or a part of the character of Scottish culture? Indeed, to whatextent other cultures either share this profile or have their own unique profile isworthy of investigation. Since some research has indicated cultural variationwith regards to time and time perspective (Spangler and Petrovich, 1978; Sagieet al., 1996; Brislan and Kim, 2003) we may have to accept that results here maynot be generalizable. However, research on time perspective itself is not yetextensive enough to begin to suggest that certain individuals and/or cultures‘own’ a particular global temporal bias.This research offers preliminary data on the BTP profile and the five tempo-ral frames of the ZTPI. There is much yet that can be done to elucidate the BTPprofile itself and whether a temporal bias that compromises wellbeing would beamenable to change, given appropriate interventions. Perhaps interventions thatfacilitate the reflective, self-awareness skills inherent in mindfulness are a firststep in this process.NoteReferencesThanks go to Lisa Drake, Fi Sutherland, Claire Abernethy and Collette Henry whocollated data as part of a larger project to fulfil degree requirements.
