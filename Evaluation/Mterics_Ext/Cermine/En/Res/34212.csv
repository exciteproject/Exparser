How is this to be explained? What is the relationship between thelogic that guides political attitudes of constituencies and the logic of political actors whose legitimacy isrooted in electoral choice of the constituencies? In this essay we approach this question from a systemicperspective, regarding this relationship as a problem solving feedback cycle. Classical approaches, such asthe median voter theorem, view political actors as passively mirroring voters’ preferences. An alternativeapproach that we suggest, assumes that the perception of competences of political actors on the part ofconstituencies is key in the sense that it does not only reflect voters’ preferences, but it is also manipulablethrough the agency of political actors themselves. More generally, we argue that the perception ofcompetence is socially constructed and contextually dependent.Keywords: political philosophy, deliberative democracy, competence fields, median voter theorem1The ordering of the authors follows alphabetical order and does not indicate any priorities.Corresponding Author: Dr. Martin Neumann, Scientific Assistant, Institute for Information Systems in Business and Public AdministrationAffiliation: University of Koblenz-LandauAddress: Universitätsstr. 1, 56070 Koblenz, Germanye-mail: maneumann@uni-koblenz.deCopyright @ 2013 Martin Neumann & Armano SrbljinovićEuropean Quarterly of Political Attitudes and Mentalities - EQPAM, Volume2, No.2 April 2013, pp. 9 – 17.ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN–L 2285 – 4916Open Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 9Neumann M., Srbljinović A.: “Essays on Political Actors and Attitudes: Do They Constitute Distributed Reflexivity?Part1: Median Voter Theorem vs. Competence Fields”EQPAM Vol.2 No.2 April 2013ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 49161. IntroductionEuropean democracies seem to be facing a crisis. In Greece the political system of the last 40years is called into question. Loss of trust in the leaders of the party system of the last 40 years has led tothe emergence of new political actors that nearly entered the government. After being governed by expertswithout democratic legitimacy, Italy seems to be lost in a permanent political crisis. Beppe Grillo’s FiveStars Movement gained considerable support for a programme which is considered by many as a boycottof politics in general. 2010 municipal elections in Reykjavík, Iceland, were won by the Best Party, a quasi-political assemblage led by a comedian, with a political “platform” full of absurd promises such as freetowels in swimming pools, acquisition of a polar bear for the local Zoo, and construction of a Disneylandnear the city airport. A candidate at 2009 Croatian local elections gathered sizable electoral support with acynical slogan: “Everything to me, nothing to you!” Another, somewhat less successful candidate at 2011Croatian parliamentary elections, based his campaign on complete avoidance of public talk, under aquizzical slogan: “Silence is gold. I’ll talk in the Parliament!” (Srbljinovic, 2013). Politicians in Romania donot seem to perceive political competitors as legitimate. Numerous additional examples of bizarre would-bepolitical leaders and caricatural political parties can be found in many European countries. In EasternEuropean countries there is also a growing body of literature on loss of trust in political actors as aconsequence of poor performance and corruption of political actors who are not believed to serve theinterests of the common public (Voinea, 2012; Atanasov and Cvetanova, 2012). The first Croatian 2013elections for the EU Parliament were marked by a very low turnout (around 20%) and an unusually highnumber of invalid ballots (more than 5%), most of which were intentionally spoiled as an expression ofoutrage at ruling political elites, both those of the ruling coalition as well as those in the opposition. It issomewhat paradoxical that in case those ballots were cast for the same party, this hypothetical “Party ofthe Disaffected” would enter the EU Parliament.Where does this apparent crisis of political representation and representatives come from? Canthis be analysed in a systematic manner, instead of simply blaming political leaders of being morallycorrupted? While this moral argument might not miss the point entirely, it needs further explanation. For thisreason we shall try to approach this problem from different angles in a number of essays in the followingissues of the European Quarterly of Political Attitudes and Mentalities. Our thesis is that the crisis istwofold: on the side of constituencies, trust in politicians is low. On the other side, however – the side ofpolitical actors – not very reliable candidates receive significant support at elections. The purpose of theessays is to suggest a framework for a theoretical model of how formation of political attitudes anddemocratic selection of political action and actors are interrelated. In this first essay we shall examine asystemic perspective on the problem: in principle, democracy should enable selection of political actorswho would adequately represent political attitudes of the society. However, as it seems, this has notoperated well in the past years. We examine this problem in more abstract terms by regarding socialsystems as problem solving systems. The classical approach to investigate the relationship betweenpolitical actors and political attitudes is the median voter theorem. It is suggested that this relationship canbe addressed by a more general notion of – perceived – competence.However, structures are enacted by actors. For this reason, the following essay will concentrate onthe perspective of political actors: why do political entrepreneurs often seem to be “more rational” than theiraudience - why do they often look like they “exploit” the audience for their own interests and aims, as statedopenly in this grotesque claim: “Everything to me, nothing to you”? To investigate this question we rely onneo-Weberian sociological actor theories. Boudon’s (2001) notions of instrumental and axiologicalOpen Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 10European Quarterly of Political Attitudes and Mentalities EQPAMVol.2, No.2, April 2013ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916rationality are introduced and put into a dynamic framework. Combined with Risse’s (2000) typology ofsituational logic, this allows to develop a mechanism of the relation between political actors and politicalattitudes that contributes to an explanation of the current crisis of political legitimacy in Europe.In the final essay we shall integrate the systemic and the actor perspective. For this purpose wedevelop the notion of distributed reflexivity. This allows to sketch the long-term dynamics of the mechanismrelating political actors and attitudes. Here we follow the research programme of deliberative democracyapproaches (Bohman, 1995; Benhabib, 1996; Chambers, 2003) to investigate the emergence (and possibledecline) of legitimacy of democratic political leadership. According to this view, democratic legitimacy arisesout of free and unconstrained public discourse (Benhabib, 1996). However, this approach has not beenuncontested. Free discourse does not guarantee that simply by the principles of discourse justice andcommon goods are achieved, but free discourse might also lead to agonistic pluralism (Mouffe, 1999). Theexamples of frivolous, would-be politicians demonstrate empirically that discourse might not lead to morallydesirable results. Thus we end with the open question of whether the current crisis indicates a process ofdistributed reflexivity or communicative bubbles. The future will show.2. An Abstract Formulation of the ProblemIn more abstract terms, social systems can be regarded as problem solving systems. Governmentsprovide specialised institutions in order to solve problems that concern the whole of a society (Almond etal., 2006; Cioffi-Revilla, 2009).2 Sometimes they fail to do so as demonstrated, for instance, by thebreakdown of the Soviet system. Less dramatically, in democratic systems a government might bedeselected because it is perceived as insufficiently or inadequately solving societal problems. Thus, it canbe said that the duty of a government is to develop policies in order to solve societal problems. Indemocratic societies the people is the sovereign of the state,3 hence the duty of the sovereign is to selectan appropriate problem-solving agency. Thus a self-organised feedback cycle between political attitudesand political actors exists (Markisic et al., 2012).Whereas politicians have the organisational capacities to set the agenda (Arnold, 1990), citizens ofdemocratic societies select one of the proposed political agendas. However, as the above examples ofgrotesque politicians indicate, there is no guarantee that this would indeed be a problem solving feedbackcycle. In particular, in times of crisis and uncertainty, democratic “search mechanisms” need not reachglobally or locally optimal results.Figure 1 provides a stylised representation of the search process that might – or might not –generate solutions for problems of public concern: problem solving activities generate some state of thesociety. For instance, reducing taxes in order to increase the economic activity changes social conditions,introducing new opportunities and new problems. Elections decide over a future political agenda whichmight be more advantageous or disadvantageous for the society. Note that a sharp distinction between“stable” and “critical” pathways is only an idealisation. Actually, there might be a gradual transition between2 Theories of the evolution of social complexity (Cohen, 1985; Tuzin, 2002) emphasise that social stratification and differentiationcan be regarded as an evolutionary solution to the problem of population pressure.3 Although this is not literally true, various definitions of democracy imply, in one way or another, that the people is indeed theultimate sovereign (cf. Bobbio, 1987, pp. 29–54; Manin, 1995, pp. 161–192; Schumpeter, 1942, p. 269; see also Dahl’s (1956, p.84) definition of poliarchy). Authoritarian systems, on the other hand, also claim to govern in the name of the people. The keydifference between democratic and authoritarian systems, however, is that the people of democratic regimes is comprised ofindividual bearers of basic and inalienable rights, while in non-democratic regimes it is the people in toto that prevails overindividuals (Mastropaolo, 2012, p. 14).Open Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 11Neumann M., Srbljinović A.: “Essays on Political Actors and Attitudes: Do They Constitute Distributed Reflexivity?Part1: Median Voter Theorem vs. Competence Fields”EQPAM Vol.2 No.2 April 2013ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916more and less efficient problem-solving activities. For instance, some decisions have to be made on how todispose of nuclear waste. The future consequences remain uncertain. However, selling the waste to otherstates may generate new problems, whereas different problems (in different time horizons) may arise if thewaste is stored below the surface of the earth. In sum, some political decisions may have consequencesthat in turn destabilise the political system or in the most extreme cases even the living conditions of thepeople.Figure 1.Schematic representation of the problem solving search processSince problems of public concern are defined by the constituencies whereas the agenda of politicalactors provides possible solutions, it seems necessary to investigate the relationship between politicalactors and political attitudes of the people in more detail. Successful politicians are those who aresuccessful in, inter alia, convincing the audience. Beside the role of the media (Habermas, 2006), this mightwell lead to a selection pressure toward a strategic rationality of communication. These considerationssuggest a closer inspection of relevant theoretical foundations.3. Classical Approach to the Relation Between Political Actors and Political Attitudes: MedianVoter Theorem.The classical approach to this question is the median voter theorem, stating that on a scale fromleft wing to right wing political opportunities, the most successful political agenda is the one preferred by theOpen Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 12European Quarterly of Political Attitudes and Mentalities EQPAMVol.2, No.2, April 2013ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916median voter (Downs, 1957). The median voter is the one who occupies the median position on the scale(Figure 2). Downs has shown that in a two party system a party that best represents the median voter willreceive most votes (Srbljinovic, 2013). It follows that the median voter theorem predicts a tendency ofpolitical parties to move toward the middle of the political attitudes’ space.Figure 2.Illustration of the Median Voter Theorem.The Median Voter Theorem has been much explored in the past decades (Congleton, 2002).Particularly in majority voting systems it has provided reasonable predictions. However, research alsorevealed the limitations of the median voter theorem (Krehbiel, 2004). Here we emphasise that it is limitedto a one dimensional scale from right wing to left wing and an assumption of an unimodal distribution ofpolitical attitudes. Moreover, the scale of possible agendas is predefined by the theoretical concept: anagenda is denoted as either left or right (Krehbiel, 2004). This might have been a correct reflection of thehistorical situation in the 1960s. However, since the end of the Cold War it often remains unclear how tocategorise a certain agenda on a scale from left to right. For instance, in multiethnic societies votes mightalso be divided along ethnic lines (Snyder, 2000; Mann, 2005). This finding might also hold for otherideologies and social value orientations. Finally, the median voter theorem assumes that voters voteaccording to their true preferences. This is questionable in regard to the problem outlined in theintroduction: why do political entrepreneurs get public support for dubious agendas characterised byridiculous slogans, such as: “Everything to me, nothing to you”? Thus the median voter theorem doespredict a certain kind of rationality of political actors, namely that they aim to maximise votes. However, itdoes so by assuming that this can be obtained by moving toward the middle of a pre-fixed scale of politicalattitudes. This does not capture the main point of a problem solving search process – selection of a certainkind of substantial solution to a substantial problem.Open Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 13Neumann M., Srbljinović A.: “Essays on Political Actors and Attitudes: Do They Constitute Distributed Reflexivity?Part1: Median Voter Theorem vs. Competence Fields”EQPAM Vol.2 No.2 April 2013ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916This limitation can be overcome with the notion of competence (Mueller 1989). The concept ofcompetence is related to the social construction of target population. Schneider and Ingram (1993) arguethat addressees of policy interventions are socially constructed types of subgroups of the population. Thesetypes may be positive (e.g. the rich) donors or negative (e.g. minorities) receivers of state policies, and theymay also be powerful (strong) or powerless (weak).Figure 3.Schematic politicians’ representation of target population.As illustrated in Figure 3, the concept of target population focuses on how politicians addressconstituencies, e.g. targeted drug addicts have generally been construed as a weak and deviantsubpopulation. Similarly, Schneider and Ingram (1993) argue that a policy addressing negatively andweakly constructed target populations such as criminals or drug addicts is mostly perceived as morecompetent by the majority of the population if it is restrictive and burdensome (at least in the US). Thus “lawand order” policy is likely to be perceived as competent. Here we add the reverse relation of howconstituencies perceive political actors. We emphasise that a political elite needs to be regarded ascompetent in order to convince a political audience of the effectiveness of the respective policy (Mueller,1989). As another example, political actors offering competence in defence activities might be regarded asimportant by many people, while those offering competence in Voodoo activities might have problems toOpen Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 14European Quarterly of Political Attitudes and Mentalities EQPAMVol.2, No.2, April 2013ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916convince a sufficient number of followers (at least in the Western world). Thus competence is related tocertain issues of public interest and there may be a multiplicity of competence fields.Insofar as political actors need to convince the constituencies of their competence in problemsolving to gain legitimacy, the concept of competence follows deliberative democracy approach. Multiplepoints of view are considered by this concept. However, it differs from this approach insofar as politicalactors and constituencies are explicitly distinguished. This allows to take differential power of politicalactors and constituencies into account. Thus far it is in line with the basic assumption of the median votertheorem that political actors react to voters’ preferences. However, the concept of competence allows toovercome the assumption of an unimodal distribution over a one-dimensional scale. For instance, a politicalparty might be perceived as highly competent with regard to economic issues but less competent withregard to security issues, or domestic and cultural politics.Figure 4.Schematic representation of competence fields.In Figure 4, the square indicates the space of political problems and the circles indicate thecompetence of hypothetical parties in these problem fields. Note that the graph illustrates the competenceas perceived by a single actor. This needs to be aggregated over the population. Moreover, it is importantto note that competence is a constructivist concept: what is essential is perceived competence, and notsome “objectively” measurable indicators. For instance, it might be reasonably questioned if “law and order”politics is truly effective. Nevertheless, political actors may still be perceived as competent if they advocateharsh measures. Perceived competence can be measured by votes. Thus, the notion of competence isrelated to the issue of legitimacy: if power is not based on pure coercion, political leaders or powerOpen Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 15Neumann M., Srbljinović A.: “Essays on Political Actors and Attitudes: Do They Constitute Distributed Reflexivity?Part1: Median Voter Theorem vs. Competence Fields”EQPAM Vol.2 No.2 April 2013ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916structures need to be regarded as competent in order to gain legitimacy. Elections provide such legitimacybecause the results can be regarded as the evidence that the winner is perceived as the most competentcandidate. At least two dimensions are involved in such a “proof”: first, what kind of agenda is seen asfacing the most urgent societal problems (e.g. economic progress, freedom, or equality). Second, what kindof agenda is perceived as the most efficient to solve these problems. However, the current crisis shows thatpolitical leaders are often no longer regarded as competent to solve societal problems. Perceivedcompetence is always only relative with regard to other competitors. Presumably frivolous politicians(Srbljinovic, 2013) do not gain votes because of their competence, but due to loss of trust in thecompetence of their competitors; i.e. protest voting can be interpreted as a signal against other candidatesrather than in favour of the candidate voted for.In this context, corruption (in the broadest sense) is an important factor. While competence isnormally judged as the ability to satisfy public interest, corrupt politicians are seen as serving only partialinterests, which implies an incentive for such politicians to frame partial interests in terms of public good.Since successful political entrepreneurs are those who are successful in convincing the audience of theircompetence, a selection pressure toward a certain kind of shrewd political communication is to beexpected. Thus we are faced with the question that political entrepreneurs often seem to be “more rational”than their audience – entrepreneurs often look like they “exploit” the audience for their own interests andaims. The trustful audience seems to be “less rational” than the entrepreneurs. And grotesque candidatesand their followers most often seem to be disillusioned and powerless, able to see through the ongoingpolitical farce on the one hand, but unable to change much on the other. Therefore they seem to resort tobizarre devices as a means of exposing pointlessness of distorted political processes.44. OutlookIn this essay we investigated the problem of relationship between political actors and politicalattitudes of the people from the perspective of the constituencies. If, for instance, the constituencies regardas the most urgent problem the question of polar bears in the local zoo, it can be assumed that either thepeople do not have more serious problems or that no other political agenda is perceived as problemsolving. Indeed, the problems caused by globalisation or financial crisis are both rather novel and serious.No solutions exist which have been proven successful in the past. In contrast to e.g. problems caused bycriminality or drugs, these problems produce a high degree of uncertainty, not only in terms of probability ofsuccess of the proposed measures but also - and more seriously - in terms of what to do at all. In terms ofa search process, voting for polar bears can be regarded as a random walk. As it is known from complexitytheory this indeed is a reasonable strategy. Voting for candidates promising polar bears can also beregarded as a mild, yet ingenious form of civil disobedience. And, it is well known from the theory of civilsociety that “civil disobedience initiates a learning process that expands the range and forms ofparticipation open to private citizens within a mature political culture” (Cohen and Arato, 1992, p. 567). Infact, Reykjavík’s zoo still lacks a polar bear, although the Best Party is doing a considerably serious job.However, the perspective of the constituencies differs from that of political actors. What kind ofstrategies and cognitive resources are to be expected from political actors and how are these related tothose of the constituencies? This will be investigated in the next essay.4 Note also that frivolous candidates can actually be welcomed by political elites since what such candidates do, in effect, is toshift the focus of public attention from the more contentious fields of competence, such as economy, social justice and the like, tothe more innocuous competences of poking fun, making sarcastic remarks and so on.Open Access at https://sites.google.com/a/fspub.unibuc.ro/european-quarterly-of-political-attitudes-and-mentalities/Page 16European Quarterly of Political Attitudes and Mentalities EQPAMVol.2, No.2, April 2013ISSN 2285 – 4916ISSN-L 2285 - 4916References1.
