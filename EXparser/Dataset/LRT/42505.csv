agement of the commons requires long-term strategies that private actors	40.49009704589844	302.68450927734375	10.5	297.5668487548828	18

Yoweri Museveni justified this decision on the grounds that the country	82.97019958496094	248.2198486328125	10.5	297.63291931152344	23

Museveni’s line of argument follows a neoliberal logic holding that	60.345703125	78.170654296875	10.5	277.7962951660156	29
what is good for business is good for the country. There appears to be	40.490203857421875	89.99365234375	10.5	297.50274658203125	29
no place in his thinking for the concerns of local communities, which are	40.490203857421875	101.816650390625	10.5	297.44610595703125	29
so vital for sustainable development centred on the protection of the	40.490203857421875	113.6396484375	10.5	297.6225280761719	29
commons. Baden and Stroup (1977: 235) sum up the tension resulting	40.490203857421875	125.462646484375	10.5	297.5384521484375	29
from the impossibility of quantifying the value of using the commons for	40.490203857421875	137.22265625	10.5	297.689697265625	29
non-extractive purposes as follows: “We know, for example, how much	40.490203857421875	149.045654296875	10.5	297.6435241699219	29
people are willing to sacrifice for a thousand board feet of lumber, but	40.490203857421875	160.86865234375	10.5	297.6298828125	29
how much would they pay for a day’s access to a wilderness area?” The	40.490203857421875	172.691650390625	10.5	297.6088562011719	29
Ugandan government’s path dependency explains why it is unwilling to	40.490203857421875	184.5146484375	10.5	297.62982177734375	29

Countering such criticism, the Ugandan government has argued that	60.345703125	219.983642578125	10.5	277.7292175292969	29
the part of Mabira Forest being allocated to private concession either	40.490203857421875	231.74365234375	10.5	297.6665954589844	29

However, the government has not addressed reports indicating that	40.490203857421875	255.3896484375	10.5	297.6622314453125	29
