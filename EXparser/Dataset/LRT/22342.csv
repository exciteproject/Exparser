ABSTRACT. This article reports on a study of how Canadian	76.35430145263672	234.258056640625	9.0	245.9925308227539	3

these changes in practice are integral to reconstituting the temporal	76.35430145263672	294.25750732421875	9.0	245.9988784790039	3

Our research not only sheds a light on these linkages and how the changed	58.0	154.44308471679688	10.0	307.9770202636719	9
temporal and structural order of the university campus is accompanied by	48.0	165.94308471679688	10.0	317.99908447265625	9
significant changes in academics’ practices. It shows the impact this is having on	48.0	177.44308471679688	10.0	317.9910583496094	9
the quality of teaching and research. The research also reveals how academics are	48.0	188.94308471679688	10.0	318.001953125	9
themselves participating in these changes, thus helping to co-produce, through	48.0	200.44308471679688	10.0	317.9841613769531	9

academics seem to be engaged in over the conflicting temporal and organization-	48.0	246.44308471679688	10.0	317.9940490722656	9
al priorities within the wired university environment, and some of the personal	48.0	257.9430847167969	10.0	317.9950256347656	9
initiatives they are taking in response. We end with some thoughts on negotiating	48.0	269.4430847167969	10.0	317.99017333984375	9
personal, organizational and public policies to support, and even renew, the	48.0	280.9430847167969	10.0	317.985107421875	9
academic vocation and the university as an institution of public culture.	48.0	292.4430847167969	10.0	280.72808837890625	9
The research involved a detailed survey of academics’ time and the quality of	58.0	303.9430847167969	10.0	307.9919738769531	9

interviews probed some of the paradoxes and contradictions the survey results	48.0	338.4430847167969	10.0	317.99407958984375	9
uncovered – for example, that while most respondents felt better connected,	48.0	349.9430847167969	10.0	317.99603271484375	9
especially nationally and globally, many also felt more isolated; and while con-	48.0	361.4430847167969	10.0	317.9909973144531	9

Over the past two and a half decades, in response to successive shifts in govern-	48.0	477.943115234375	10.0	317.98809814453125	11

cumulative. Each layer of adaptation and each new initiative has rested upon and	40.35430145263672	62.443115234375	10.0	317.9890823364258	14

The retrenchment layer began around the mid-1970s, as federal and provin-	50.35430145263672	85.44308471679688	10.0	307.99808502197266	14

‘normal’. Over time, it became evident that ‘under-funding’ had become the	40.35430145263672	131.44308471679688	10.0	317.99707794189453	14

As fiscal pressures increased, so too internal tensions were exacerbated. The	50.35430145263672	154.44308471679688	10.0	307.9939651489258	14

In the early 1980s, a powerful idea began to infuse higher education policy	50.35430145263672	223.44308471679688	10.0	307.98609161376953	14

increased their collaborative projects not just a little but a lot.7 They also feel that	40.35430145263672	85.36175537109375	10.081329345703125	318.0007095336914	22

there’s ambivalence here and even a hint of contradiction. It’s also increased	40.353973388671875	131.44308471679688	10.0	317.9980773925781	22

cated that this had decreased. On the other hand, 51 per cent said that it had not	40.353973388671875	154.44308471679688	10.019317626953125	317.9999694824219	22

(71% of the women, 50% of men) feel that it’s increased expectations of what	40.353973388671875	177.44308471679688	10.0	318.0030212402344	22
they can accomplish. Nearly 40 per cent (45% of the women, 31% of men)	40.353973388671875	188.94308471679688	10.0	317.98907470703125	22

It is clear, then, that there are many things academics do not like about the	50.353973388671875	234.94308471679688	10.0	308.0001525878906	22

compared to 19% of men), the men reported far more incidents of road rage and	40.353973388671875	361.4430847167969	10.0	318.0	22
its variants (22% of men, versus 5% of women).	40.353973388671875	372.9430847167969	10.0	193.25498962402344	22

urgent attention. However, echoing others’ speculations, we see it here as a	40.353973388671875	395.9430847167969	10.0	317.99298095703125	22

feel as though they’re fighting to keep control on occasion and another 20 per	48.0	211.94308471679688	10.0	317.98602294921875	27
cent feel that way frequently. Moreover, 58 per cent reported that their ability	48.0	223.44308471679688	10.0	317.9970397949219	27
to stay focused on their work had decreased, and 42 per cent reported that their	48.0	234.94308471679688	10.0	317.9950866699219	27
susceptibility to being distracted by all the information and communication	48.0	246.44308471679688	10.0	317.9991149902344	27
coming at them had increased.	48.0	257.9430847167969	10.0	121.89199829101562	27
These findings suggest a significant degree of ‘temporal alienation,’ which	58.0	269.4430847167969	10.0	308.0009765625	27
Ronald Purser (2002) defines as a ‘loss of situated presence in time’ (p. 163),	48.0	280.9430847167969	10.0	317.9890441894531	27
and which we interpret here to mean presence with others and to one’s self.	48.0	292.4430847167969	10.0	301.5160827636719	27
A professor of organizational behaviour at one university reported having	58.0	303.9430847167969	10.0	307.9890441894531	27
‘fewer and fewer coffees with colleagues who are right in the building and . . .	48.0	315.4430847167969	10.0	317.986083984375	27
[now] more short conversations with people I would never have contacted	48.0	326.9430847167969	10.0	317.9900207519531	27
before. So I’m trading one for the other.’ ‘Quantity for quality?’ she was asked.	48.0	338.4430847167969	10.0	317.9980773925781	27
‘Yes’, she said. ‘It is very superficial and there is no real depth of communica-	48.0	349.9430847167969	10.0	318.0	27

she’s losing her political consciousness because ‘there’s no one to push me and	48.0	372.9430847167969	10.0	317.9920654296875	27
develop me . . . and say, that’s good as far as it goes, and have you thought about	48.0	384.4430847167969	10.0	317.9720764160156	27
. . .?’ As a result, she said, ‘I have less confidence in my own analysis . . . It’s	48.0	395.9430847167969	10.0	317.984130859375	27
almost back to those pre-consciousness days. We are living in that isolation and	48.0	407.4430847167969	10.0	317.9830322265625	27
not having any validation.’	48.0	418.9430847167969	10.0	107.74400329589844	27

calls she used to have with close colleagues and friends now that everyone has	48.0	441.9430847167969	10.0	317.988037109375	27
answering machines and communicates through email: ‘there’s the absence of	48.0	453.4430847167969	10.0	317.9999694824219	27

people in a local community has increased enormously’.	48.0	487.9430847167969	10.0	225.467041015625	27
A professor of occupational therapy at yet another university echoed this	58.0	499.4430847167969	10.0	307.98809814453125	27
theme: ‘I feel very connected to people I don’t expect to see. But what I do find	48.0	510.943115234375	10.0	317.99603271484375	27
is that people I expect to see, like my colleagues who are in the same building, I	48.0	522.443115234375	9.999996185302734	317.9810485839844	27

A professor of social work at the same university worried that as she and	50.35430145263672	96.94308471679688	10.0	307.9889907836914	30

social engagement can become the cultural norm: ‘It is a stilted dialogue.’ She	40.35430145263672	119.94308471679688	10.0	317.9941177368164	30
was asked, ‘does it move you away from spontaneity?’. ‘Yes, and that’s not all.	40.35430145263672	131.44308471679688	10.0	317.9871292114258	30
Sometimes we think with our mouths. But on the other hand, we’re so pressured	40.35430145263672	142.94308471679688	10.0	317.98206329345703	30
to give a response that we type up something and send it out because of the	40.35430145263672	154.44308471679688	10.0	317.9810562133789	30

Elsewhere, a professor of film studies lamented that this pressure serves as	50.35430145263672	177.44308471679688	10.0	308.00598907470703	30
an alibi for non-presence: ‘It is easier if everyone is anonymous. It makes it	40.35430145263672	188.94308471679688	10.0	317.99503326416016	30
easier to refuse social interaction. It makes it easier to turn people into things	40.35430145263672	200.44308471679688	10.0	317.9971389770508	30
and to just not be creating a humanistic environment.’ This has particularly	40.35430145263672	211.94308471679688	10.0	317.9900588989258	30
acute implications for women, she thinks. ‘We women have always been	40.35430145263672	223.44308471679688	10.0	317.99308013916016	30
the embodied subject and technology seems to be erasing our presence in the	40.35430145263672	234.94308471679688	10.0	317.98999786376953	30

is just damaging our sense of authenticity that way – authentic subjects who	40.35430145263672	257.9430847167969	10.0	317.9931106567383	30

For example, it used to be they had a weekly seminar and every professor would	52.35430145263672	168.74746704101562	9.0	293.99491119384766	39

lot of information, trying to get information somehow. We are not teaching them	52.35430145263672	228.74691772460938	9.0	293.9994888305664	39
to use that information, to process it and then to create something. I think that in	52.35430145263672	238.746826171875	9.0	293.9869155883789	39
this sense, that is what they call passivity. If they are passive, they don’t create.	52.35430145263672	248.74673461914062	9.0	285.37744903564453	39
A biology professor at another university echoed this concern, worrying at how	40.35430145263672	265.4430847167969	10.0	317.9840774536133	40

‘modules’ that students alternately ingest or cut and paste into assignments. ‘But	40.35430145263672	288.4430847167969	10.0	317.99414825439453	40
learning isn’t about the details of what you are learning, I think. It is more	40.35430145263672	299.9430847167969	10.0	317.9870376586914	40
fundamental . . . The important point ultimately is just to get the students to	40.35430145263672	311.4430847167969	10.0	317.98612213134766	40
think. It doesn’t matter, it could be biology. Thinking about how biology works	40.35430145263672	322.9430847167969	10.0	317.9841995239258	40

The professor of engineering quoted earlier talked about how important face-	50.35430145263672	345.9430847167969	10.0	307.9950637817383	40
to-face dialogue is to convey to students that one is always creating knowledge	40.35430145263672	357.4430847167969	10.0	317.9860610961914	40
afresh, not just replicating it prescriptively. For example, he said, ‘how to deal	40.35430145263672	368.9430847167969	10.0	317.99710845947266	40
with a design problem on line. In many ways it is trial and error. Even defining	40.35430145263672	380.4430847167969	10.0	317.98099517822266	40
the problem, it isn’t really an absolute. We say the structure could be very rigid	40.35430145263672	391.9430847167969	10.0	317.9990005493164	40

Clearly, the changes affecting universities through the combined effects of	40.35430145263672	472.4430847167969	10.0	317.9960708618164	42
retrenching, repositioning plus retro-fitting have included a radical change in	40.35430145263672	483.9430847167969	10.0	317.99207305908203	42
temporality. From the evidence of the survey and the follow-up interviews, this	40.35430145263672	495.4430847167969	10.0	317.9981460571289	42

for research and policy action, it’s useful to identify some of the particular ways	48.0	62.443115234375	10.0	318.00299072265625	45
in which this cultural transformation is manifest, for instance through temporal	48.0	73.943115234375	9.999969482421875	318.0010070800781	45
frameworks, through temporal-social practices and through the shaping power	48.0	85.44308471679688	10.0	317.9960632324219	45
of temporal rhythms.	48.0	96.94308471679688	10.0	84.1409912109375	45
Dick Pels (2003) provides a useful overview of the shifting temporal coordi-	58.0	108.44308471679688	10.0	307.9920654296875	45
nates on which universities now run. In what he calls the ‘social triangle’ of	48.0	119.94308471679688	10.0	317.9970703125	45
discourse in the public sphere, he locates the university in the ‘culture/science’	48.0	131.44308471679688	10.0	317.99407958984375	45
node (p. 21). He argues that its reputedly tempered pace traditionally had a	48.0	142.94308471679688	10.0	317.989013671875	45
mitigating influence on the otherwise faster time frames and pace associated	48.0	154.44308471679688	10.0	318.00494384765625	45
with business and the market economy, occupying the second apex of his	48.0	165.94308471679688	10.0	317.9821472167969	45
triangle, and on politics/the state, occupying the third. Now, however, the macro	48.0	177.44308471679688	10.0	317.9870300292969	45

this is clearly happening, with ICT networks and their users playing a decisively	48.0	257.9430847167969	10.0	317.9941101074219	45
enabling role. Moreover, academics are adapting to the shorter time lines and	48.0	269.4430847167969	10.0	318.0	45
new ‘infrastructural routines’ associated with the wired campus, often willingly	48.0	280.9430847167969	10.0	318.0030822753906	45
and for their own self-interest.	48.0	292.4430847167969	10.0	121.32899475097656	45
Our research also sheds light on the changing temporal practices associated	58.0	303.9430847167969	10.0	307.99603271484375	45
with the networked, on-line campus. Not only is time compressed. It is frag-	48.0	315.4430847167969	10.0	317.9930725097656	45

As discussed, this has consequences, ranging from the suppression of time-	48.0	338.4430847167969	10.0	317.987060546875	45
consuming activities like reflection and memory (Sabelis, 2002) to temporal	48.0	349.9430847167969	10.0	318.0000915527344	45
alienation. While Purser (2002) links this explicitly to a shifting temporality,	48.0	361.4430847167969	10.0	318.0011291503906	45
arguing that the loss of presence happens as people ‘embody’ and ‘obey’ the	48.0	372.9430847167969	10.0	317.99005126953125	45

adds a layer of useful complexity by discussing how temporal practices are	48.0	395.9430847167969	10.0	317.989013671875	45
diffused more broadly through organizational innovations like productivity	48.0	407.4430847167969	10.0	317.9921569824219	45
measures and the application of logistical reasoning to expediting the flow of	48.0	418.9430847167969	10.0	317.9970397949219	45

the more experience-based stuff of interpretation. While historical critiques of	48.0	487.9430847167969	10.0	318.0110778808594	45
instrumentalism, associated with the Frankfurt School for example, didn’t	48.0	499.4430847167969	10.0	318.0020446777344	45
speculate about the role of time (Hassan, 2003), we would argue that it runs on	48.0	510.943115234375	10.0	317.98406982421875	45

is that it is a language of standardized abstractions delinked from the particulars	40.35430145263672	257.9430847167969	10.0	318.0000991821289	48
of place and people, their embodied experience, stories and memories. And	40.35430145263672	269.4430847167969	10.0	317.9880142211914	48
while it still takes time for people to key this language onto the screen, or click	40.35430145263672	280.9430847167969	10.0	317.9880142211914	48
and drag it from one file to another, the abstract immateriality of the medium	40.35430145263672	292.4430847167969	10.0	318.00199127197266	48
means that its scope for embodied presence is minimal and its capacity to invoke	40.35430145263672	303.9430847167969	10.0	317.99207305908203	48
the rhythms of dialogue, nil. Partly, this is due to another temporal aspect of the	40.35430145263672	315.4430847167969	10.0	317.99405670166016	48
wired university environment, namely that communication is instant.	40.35430145263672	326.9430847167969	10.0	275.7541275024414	48
This is the novelty of ‘real time’, making digital networks hyper-efficient	50.35430145263672	338.4430847167969	10.0	308.0060806274414	48
from an instrumental point of view but potentially dangerous from a human and	40.35430145263672	349.9430847167969	10.0	317.9900894165039	48
cultural point of view. As Ronald Purser (2002) argues, in its deft collapse of	40.35430145263672	361.4430847167969	10.0	317.99503326416016	48
action and reaction through simultaneity, the real time on which digital networks	40.35430145263672	372.9430847167969	10.0	317.99512481689453	48
operate models a reality characterized by Hannah Arendt as the ‘means-ends	40.35430145263672	384.4430847167969	10.0	317.9970474243164	48
paradigm’ (p. 156). This view of what’s real is focused entirely on bringing	40.35430145263672	395.9430847167969	10.0	317.9950637817383	48
about the desired result. Purser argues that time of any duration longer than an	40.35430145263672	407.4430847167969	10.0	317.9981155395508	48
instant is immaterial, an obstacle to be removed. Yet the effect of this – what one	40.35430145263672	418.9430847167969	10.0	318.00305938720703	48
interview subject referred to simply as ‘the pressure to respond’ – is for people	40.35430145263672	430.4430847167969	10.0	318.0030288696289	48
to ‘fall back on learned routines and unconscious cognitive biases’, in short to	40.35430145263672	441.9430847167969	10.0	317.98914337158203	48
‘perform’. In Thrift’s (2000b) characterization of life in the globalized new	40.35430145263672	453.4430847167969	10.0	318.00406646728516	48

‘performability’. This means, as the word suggests, performance to script and	40.35430145263672	487.9430847167969	10.0	317.99402618408203	48

Sabelis’s concerns about the inability of chronically time-compressed people to	48.00028991699219	119.94308471679688	10.0	317.9950714111328	51

It’s true to the point of being a truism that we are all rooted in the ‘rhythmic-	58.00028991699219	177.44308471679688	10.0	307.9960174560547	51

Nonetheless, rhythms based on social convention have so eclipsed natural	48.00028991699219	200.44308471679688	10.0	317.9840545654297	51

many primal rhythms are residual to the point of being vestigial. Moreover, as	48.00028991699219	223.44308471679688	10.0	317.99110412597656	51

social environment, there is a danger that the sense of rootedness in anything	48.00028991699219	257.9430847167969	10.0	317.9931182861328	51
embodied and physical will become that much weaker. Accordingly, the social	48.00028991699219	269.4430847167969	10.0	317.9860076904297	51
