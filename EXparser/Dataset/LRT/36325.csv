The exploration of performative research practices is in its nascent stage,	140.0399169921875	184.3155517578125	9.48004150390625	292.1480407714844	9

troversy surrounds such efforts, in part because they raise significant questions	128.69993591308594	218.81610107421875	9.48004150390625	303.5760955810547	9

various ways in which scientific theory and descriptions are suffused with	128.69993591308594	368.33837890625	9.47998046875	303.5846405029297	9

Augusto Boal (1995) is seminal in this respect. Jonathan Shailor’s work with	128.69993591308594	540.8409423828125	9.47998046875	303.57044982910156	9

these assumptions are undermined. The use of theater, fiction, poetry, or art,	140.0399932861328	391.31512451171875	9.47998046875	292.25599670410156	19

the representations of the results.	128.69993591308594	322.3177490234375	9.480010986328125	125.34077453613281	25
The second issue is that of the accumulation of knowledge and the progress	140.0399169921875	333.8378601074219	9.47998046875	292.2162170410156	25
of the discipline. Traditional social science prized itself on these capacities.	128.69993591308594	345.2982177734375	9.47998046875	303.6585235595703	25
Performative approaches are less committed to these goals, but more invested	128.69993591308594	356.81829833984375	9.47998046875	303.5874786376953	25

search process itself (Keen & Tordes, 2007). In the case of performative in-	128.69993591308594	379.7987365722656	9.47998046875	303.63771057128906	25
quiry, there may be accumulation in terms of communicative efficacy, but an	128.69993591308594	391.3188171386719	9.47998046875	303.54100036621094	25
investment in increments in knowledge and disciplinary progress is typically	128.69993591308594	402.8388977050781	9.47998046875	303.5884552001953	25
replaced by a concern with making an immediate impact of cultural signifi-	128.69993591308594	414.29925537109375	9.47998046875	303.59034729003906	25
cance. Performatively oriented scholars note that because patterns of social life	128.69993591308594	425.8193359375	9.47998046875	303.57518005371094	25
are continuously transforming, the emphasis on accumulation is misleading.	128.699951171875	437.33941650390625	9.47998046875	303.5884094238281	25
The social sciences acquire their significance not from attempting to predict the	128.699951171875	448.7997741699219	9.47998046875	303.7049255371094	25
future from observations of the past, but from entering into those deliberations	128.699951171875	460.3198547363281	9.47998046875	303.6690368652344	25
