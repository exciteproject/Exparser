complete split between social sciences and psychology/psychoanalysis. It presents the background	144.6999969482422	204.592529296875	9.0	397.2329864501953	5
in his materialist socialization theory, which combines a social reinterpretation of the core insights in	144.6999969482422	218.6925048828125	9.0	398.97889709472656	5

methodology is based on a transformation of the "scenic understanding" from a clinical to a text	144.6999969482422	246.99249267578125	9.0	381.19483947753906	5

with an illustration of the interpretation procedure from social research. Then follows a brief	144.6999969482422	275.29248046875	9.0	363.1409454345703	5

psycho-societal research is briefly summarized, emphasizing the role of the researcher subjects in	144.6999969482422	331.8924865722656	9.0	392.72389221191406	5
discovering socially unconscious meaning in social interaction. Finally an outlook to contemporary	144.6999969482422	346.09246826171875	9.0	391.43690490722656	5
epistemological issues. LORENZER's approach to theorize and research the subject as a socially	144.6999969482422	360.1924743652344	9.0	389.8260040283203	5

BERGER and LUCKMANN argue that knowledge sociology provides the	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	353.15504455566406	23

through a process of sedimentation and/or reification. Obviously they see MEAD's	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	398.7941436767578	23

It is a bit strange, in view of BERGER and LUCKMANN 's ambitious project, to	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	381.63392639160156	26

relation between individual and society in a social science landscape where the	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	385.41810607910156	31
disciplinary domains separated knowledge of the individual from knowledge about	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	398.29920959472656	31

appears even more remarkable, that Alfred LORENZER developed a theory	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	369.79798889160156	31

psycho-dynamic theorizing of the subject it had two interrelated reasons. One is	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	388.2671661376953	32
that he has been particularly productive for the development of a methodology of	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	393.27223205566406	32
empirical qualitative research. The other one is that his socialization theory by	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	378.7960968017578	32

2. Alfred LORENZER's Intellectual Journey	144.6999969482422	532.2366943359375	12.0	242.5441131591797	33
Alfred LORENZER (1922-2002) came from the background of being a medical	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	382.7232208251953	34
psychiatrist, trained in psychoanalysis on a Freudian background. As a doctor	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	378.11427307128906	34
and psychoanalyst, he took an early interest in societal critique and cultural	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	365.99205017089844	34
theory, taking to task the Frankfurt school of thought and its critical theory.	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	362.25218200683594	34
Understanding subjective structure as influenced by societal conditions	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	345.6640167236328	34
increasingly came to dominate his theoretical thoughts. As early as 1970, he	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	372.31715393066406	34
criticized the psychoanalytical concept of "symbol" (1970a), placed it in a	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	354.0351104736328	34
linguistic science context (1970b), and subsequently expanded the application of	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	392.7553253173828	34
it into socialization theory (1972), epistemology (1974) and cultural analysis	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	366.7180938720703	34
(1986). The red thread of his contribution is to provide a ground for a social	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	366.1680145263672	34
interpretation of the basic psychodynamic forces without giving up the radical	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	375.2870635986328	34
insights in FREUD's theory. The first step in this chain from psychoanalysis to	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	378.1360626220703	34
societal theory was an interactionist theory of socialization (1972) in which he	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	375.94703674316406	34
reconceptualized these psychodynamic forces which in classical psychoanalysis	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	390.0711212158203	34
since FREUD were seen as biological, result of natural drives. LORENZER	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	364.9579620361328	34
established a dialectical theory according to which they were results of the social	144.6999969482422	773.1796875	10.999996185302734	392.75514221191406	34

initiated by a number of psychoanalysts: In continuation of FREUD he analyzes	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	385.85816955566406	38

bodily interactions" (1972, p.17; see the Acknowledgments for translation issues).	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	397.2780303955078	38
But whereas FREUD saw their impact in the psyche, as predominantly distortion,	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	393.64625549316406	38

societal relations. Symbolic/cultural meaning (for the individual) is seen as a	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	369.6110382080078	38
complex mediation of social interaction and sensual experience, and has	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	354.2001190185547	38
conscious as well as unconscious aspects. Later LORENZER developed further	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	388.9491729736328	38
his key concept of "interaction forms" to understand the inner, pre-linguistic	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	365.94810485839844	38
experiences of practices and relations. These interaction forms are connected	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	379.8961944580078	38
with the socially recognized language to form symbolic interaction forms, and the	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	393.82215881347656	38
developing of capacity for symbolic production can be seen as an integrated	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	371.08509826660156	38
aspect of socialization. This understanding of the early socialization process	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	370.2820587158203	38
enables LORENZER to see language, interaction and bodily (drive) processes in	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	392.8651885986328	38
their wider societal context—and we can add an epistemological perspective: In	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	387.73915100097656	38
the context of a constructivist social science it enables us to see how ideas about	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	395.4062042236328	38
societal relations are embodied in the individual socialization. LORENZER's	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	367.8618927001953	38
thoughts on the role of language in subject constitution build on the theorem of	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	383.4601593017578	38
language games, which he took up from the works of Ludwig WITTGENSTEIN	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	383.94398498535156	38
and developed further. Language is anchored in concrete social practice in a	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	373.73609924316406	38
dialectic unit of language use, everyday life practice and view of the world	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	358.41294860839844	38
(WEBER, 2010). Language games are thus defined as the interface at which	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	375.0891876220703	38
subjective and objective structures interact. The question of the constitution of	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	380.22621154785156	38
language games is, therefore, also one which addresses the constitution of the	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	384.60414123535156	38
relationship between individual and society. Looked at in this way, language and	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	390.72023010253906	38
awareness are inseparably linked with social practice. If the constitution of	144.6999969482422	773.1796875	10.999996185302734	361.0309600830078	38

LORENZER's contribution to the methodology gains a wider perspective by	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	366.72911071777344	42

which unlike many other theories does not see the social shaping of the individual	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	397.8922882080078	42

psychological and methodological notions are closely linked with the search for	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	384.0871124267578	42

interaction. LORENZER in brief draws the attention to the hermeneutic	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	343.9921112060547	42
methodology of psychoanalytic understanding. The immediate inspiration is	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	367.22398376464844	42

The socialization theory was LORENZER's first distinguishing contribution. It	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	372.20692443847656	43
builds the theoretical foundation for the development of a psycho-societal	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	357.10411071777344	43

and 1970s and may be read as the key text to the complex meta-theoretical ideas	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	398.11231994628906	47
that have proven useful in empirical studies in many areas of social life under the	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	394.3721466064453	47

LORENZER believes this is where what he calls the "hard and provocative work"	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	392.50209045410156	48
(1986, pp.16f.) in the psychoanalytical critique of society and culture enters. He	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	385.99012756347656	48
sees the position of psychoanalysis between differing disciplines against whose	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	387.16700744628906	48
borders it grates. The "conflict potential" of a psychoanalytic approach	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	341.1211395263672	48
traditionally arises from revealing the social constraints a subject faces, but, more	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	397.1662139892578	48
importantly, how desires and past experiences may influence e.g. cultural	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	357.96217346191406	48
productions like literature. LORENZER here emphasizes the difference between	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	390.5221710205078	48
a therapeutic and a social or literary discovery process:	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	268.81797790527344	48
"Where therapy is concerned, the origin [of the subject] is investigated by asking: how	167.39999389648438	519.236083984375	10.0	376.0697326660156	49
did the conflict arise in the case of this individual? In cultural analysis, however, the	167.39999389648438	533.4360961914062	10.0	363.9297790527344	49
question is: what kind of conflict are we dealing with? The focus is on the conflict	167.39999389648438	547.5361328125	10.0	353.6296081542969	49
between unconscious desires and conscious values" (p.67). [13]	167.39999389648438	561.736083984375	10.0	282.8699951171875	49
In fact the notion of conflict in the last sentence might be a bit misleading in	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	367.06996154785156	50

influenced by experiences in the past, and conscious and unconscious dynamics	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	393.2282257080078	50

social interaction and cultural meanings. LORENZER and his colleagues	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	353.4739532470703	53
eventually demonstrates this potential in interpretation of arts products, but the	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	382.95423889160156	53
insights in societal nature of the subjective processes opens a door to interpret	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	383.53724670410156	53
not only cultural products, but to interpret interviews and other qualitative material	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	396.5832061767578	53
from empirical research of a wide range of more profane social practices and	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	375.32008361816406	53

Alfred LORENZER's introduction article "Tiefenhermeneutische Kulturanalysen"	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	388.05812072753906	55
in the book "KulturAnalysen" (1986) is as close as he comes to spell out a	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	360.0191192626953	55
methodology. Basically he points to the hermeneutic (interpretational) nature of	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	385.12123107910156	55
the form of understanding which is used in psychoanalytical therapeutic practice,	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	392.95314025878906	55
generalizes it in what he calls the "scenic understanding," and comments the	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	374.0221710205078	55
nature of this transformation. The particular value of these thoughts mainly	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	363.8580780029297	55
become evident in reflecting a research practice by means of researchers	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	358.98509216308594	55
subjectively engaging in the interpretation, tracing aspects of social relations	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	371.8991241455078	55
which are not immediately visible and may be not even conscious for social	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	366.1680450439453	55
actors. For this reason we developed an interpretation process example of a text	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	392.3921661376953	55
which had been presented in the research group. In the following this sample	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	375.41908264160156	55
scene and our interpretation of it will be used for illustration linking our	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	341.14283752441406	55
interpretation steps along this short sequence with central passages of	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	344.35508728027344	55
LORENZER's text. As it usually is the case the interpretation process became an	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	394.4822540283203	55
illustration in itself—interpretation requires the engagement of the interpreters in	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	390.1042022705078	55
an interaction with the text which transcends the obvious meaning of the text, and	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	397.38624572753906	55
hence becomes part of the interpretation in itself. We took up a brief scene	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	365.0680694580078	55
presented in the Dubrovnik workshops by our British colleague Joanne	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	344.3660125732422	55
WHITEHOUSE, who used qualitative methods to study a popular yet highly	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	366.8721466064453	55
contested form of media product—the reality TV program Big Brother, which has	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	392.52406311035156	55
sparked heated debate not just in Great Britain (REDMANN & WHITEHOUSE-	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	382.9428253173828	55

studies to show what scenic understanding might mean for empirical analysis. [15]	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	393.8470001220703	55
We analyzed the reaction of a female viewer as portrayed in the following scene.	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	393.30506896972656	56
We interpreted the scene as a representation, not as a factual account that can	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	387.00233459472656	56
be read at face value, and not as a transparent subjective expression. We	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	360.43711853027344	56
assumed that such representations are based on shared cultural experience and	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	393.17335510253906	56
provide us with access to subjective and social dynamics, which we attempt to	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	380.8750762939453	56
reveal with the aid of LORENZER's thinking. [16]	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	237.7469940185547	56
The structure of this type of program is a closed group who is monitored in their	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	387.6291046142578	57
interaction, and the viewers are invited to vote about who should be sent home at	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	395.8682403564453	57
each stage of the show. An interviewee, Lou, reported (to Joanne) that she had	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	386.7272491455078	57
been watching an episode of Big Brother. One of the housemates, Jonny, offered	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	396.30824279785156	57
a second housemate, Adele, a cup of coffee. Adele refused in a friendly fashion	144.6999969482422	773.1796875	10.999996185302734	388.3441925048828	57

but as Jonny walked away she mouthed the words "Fuck off" to his retreating	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0	375.9582061767578	60
back. The interviewee, Lou, was so outraged by what she took to be Adele's two-	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	395.0652618408203	60
faced behavior that she decided she would vote to have Adele evicted from the	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	384.9781036376953	60
show and, moreover, that she had to do this straight away. Because her own	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	373.93421936035156	60
phone was out of order she rushed from the house to use a public phone box on	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	391.7432403564453	60
the corner of her street. Unfortunately, the phone box was occupied and, feeling	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	389.8073272705078	60
increasingly frustrated, the interviewee started banging on the phone box door	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	380.86415100097656	60

explained in the interview. [17]	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	147.94700622558594	60
At first glance the text we looked at irritates and confuses, displays a remarkable	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	392.92018127441406	61
amount of emotion and contains a variety of action and interaction levels which all	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	398.4641876220703	61
run together. It may also provoke normative reactions in the interpreter, not least	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	392.38124084472656	61
as regards the contested TV format that attracts large numbers of viewers. The	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	386.2761993408203	61
scientific and popular controversies concerning a program like Big Brother thus	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	384.9230499267578	61
point to underlying issues of subject and society in the context of social change:	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	388.38832092285156	61
on the one hand the age-old discussion about how much influence mass media	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	386.38612365722656	61
has in guiding people's actions, on the other hand the much more interesting	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	373.5271759033203	61
question about how the contents of the media engage with the subjective issues	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	390.32411193847656	61
of the audiences. [18]	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	105.74699401855469	61
The manifest meaning of the sequence is readily visible: we are witness to an	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	377.8939971923828	62
emotionally loaded reaction in the context of a medially presented group player	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	384.2691192626953	62
game. The structure of sequence the constitutes a dual scene: contestants in the	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	395.51332092285156	62
containers and contestants in front on the TV enter into a relationship with one	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	381.7991485595703	62
another whereby the quality of their relationships is the key to further exclusion or	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	396.26417541503906	62
inclusion of individual players. In other words, the publicly celebrated relationships	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	399.02516174316406	62
between the inhabitants of the container give the viewers a chance to enter into a	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	396.2312774658203	62
relationship which forms the basis for their decision on whether or not to vote for	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	390.7971954345703	62
or against a particular contestant. [19]	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	185.04701232910156	62
There are several simplistic interpretations of the scene which are near at hand	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	385.82521057128906	63
(and the interpreting group did not evade the temptation in the first place): we	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	377.0360870361328	63
could interpret it as a confirmation of a culturally pessimistic standpoint	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	344.61900329589844	63
concerning the increasing degeneration of the mass media, or in a more or less	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	387.65113830566406	63
psychological sense as an expression of a threatened if not damaged subjectivity	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	395.72523498535156	63
which comes to light with the loss of key self-determination skills. Although	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	363.41700744628906	63
different in focus they both leave little space for understanding subjective agency.	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	397.4469757080078	63
In a way they treat the social agent as a patient and diagnose his/her vulnerability	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	397.23231506347656	63
for social conditions. Alfred LORENZER provides the theoretical arguments for	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	383.4491729736328	63
avoiding such premature classifications. In LORENZER's work, we read that	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	371.0739288330078	63
apart from the manifest and latent meaning levels "texts" house an unconscious	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	388.97120666503906	63
meaning dimension which we can enter as readers, as observers or as	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	345.14710998535156	63

"The impulse in psychoanalytical therapy is to change the patient who is being	167.39999389648438	745.6361083984375	10.0	342.2996826171875	64

profane television watching. Posing these questions to the interpreters of the	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	373.9561309814453	68

in this case to Lou. What is it that makes her act so impulsively? If we go by what	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	395.4611358642578	68

vote Adele immediately off the show and head out to find a telephone. According	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	393.19532775878906	68

(FREUD, 1957 [1915]). It is actually a more complicated theory about levels of	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	380.61109924316406	69
(un)consciousness with grey zones and displacements, which in FREUD's	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	360.65696716308594	69

reconstruct a dual scene in which various interaction dynamics overlay one	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	364.84803771972656	69

"The provocation lies in content in the text itself. As such, its impact goes beyond the	167.39999389648438	674.9360961914062	10.0	371.9095764160156	71

which goes beyond the actual state of consciousness—either because it contains	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	396.0882110595703	74
interaction experiences that have later been excluded from consciousness, or	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	377.6302032470703	74

generate a utopian potential. It is the work of hermeneutics to reveal this utopian	167.39999389648438	250.43609619140625	10.0	352.4295959472656	75

"Does this imply that the unconscious is the sole aim of psychoanalytical	167.39999389648438	703.236083984375	10.0	317.4696960449219	79

influence the agency and produces an intense ambivalence. The reconstruction	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	387.5852813720703	84
of this ambivalence helps to reveal the unconscious in the text. We will address	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	386.3750762939453	84
the interpretation procedure in more detail later. For the time being, however, we	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	392.45814514160156	84
will stay with the relationship between manifest and latent meaning and read what	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	397.9362335205078	84
LORENZER thinks:	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	94.80899047851562	84
"... the distinguishing feature of psychoanalytical cultural analysis as an 'in-depth	167.39999389648438	434.3360900878906	10.0	351.9596252441406	85
hermeneutic' is about the recognition of an independent level of meaning below the	167.39999389648438	448.5361022949219	10.014739990234375	364.8301086425781	85
meaning generating level of language symbolism. While the manifest meaning	167.39999389648438	462.6361083984375	10.0	344.43963623046875	85
resides in the socially recognized figures of consciousness, a level of unconscious	167.39999389648438	476.8360900878906	10.0	360.7897644042969	85
interaction forms [Interaktionsformen] is pushed into consciousness on the level of	167.39999389648438	490.93609619140625	10.014739990234375	361.2997741699219	85
latent meaning. It is certainly the case that this level of meaning, 'excluded by	167.39999389648438	505.1361083984375	10.0	339.1296081542969	85

interested, and which Freud counted to parapraxes. But, at the same time, the	167.39999389648438	533.4360961914062	10.0	343.37945556640625	85
manifest text-meaning is still important—as the counterpart to what is concealed-	167.39999389648438	547.5361328125	10.0	355.7696838378906	85
forbidden. Manifest- and latent-text meaning construct a contradictory pair, which	167.39999389648438	561.736083984375	10.0	355.8595275878906	85
psychoanalysis must seek to resolve [aufzuheben hat]" (1986, p.29, our translation). [28]	167.39999389648438	575.8360595703125	10.0147705078125	372.1700134277344	85
For cultural analysis, when unconscious interaction forms are pushed to the	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	368.4671173095703	86
consciousness it means that the latent meaning of a text offers a potential access	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	397.56227111816406	86
to understand collective dimensions of the unconscious. Manifest and latent	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	369.0501251220703	86
meaning are dialectically related because language use point to non-verbal or	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	378.8401641845703	86

concept of "unconscious interaction forms." It does not mean that we can simply	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	390.45619201660156	86
identify the unconscious and the non-verbal: unconscious meanings are in the	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	380.18226623535156	86

mutual exchanges and is therefore the inscription of this particular ontogenesis	185.5	281.83612060546875	10.0	346.25958251953125	95
'systematic', because from the first moment in a life-history, one memory trace	185.5	299.03607177734375	10.0	343.87945556640625	96

past social interplay and drafts for that of the future (1986, pp.46-47). [30]	185.5	344.6361083984375	10.0	322.4700012207031	97
In this framework Lou's disturbingly excessive action that lends the scene	144.6999969482422	372.1796875	11.0	357.79710388183594	98

leaving the house, the purposeful movement in space, the hammering against the	144.6999969482422	414.5796813964844	11.0	398.5082550048828	98
door of the telephone box. The TV show seems to set a subject's past interaction	144.6999969482422	428.7796936035156	11.0	395.1092071533203	98

registered as a bodily experience of social interaction. The reactivation of these	144.6999969482422	457.0796813964844	11.0	386.44117736816406	98
interaction forms happens not in the sense of simple repetition of old conflicts, but	144.6999969482422	471.1796875	11.0	398.6841583251953	98
as part of a dynamic interaction between old, past and new, current interaction	144.6999969482422	485.37969970703125	11.0	382.09620666503906	98
experiences. The unconscious meaning of the scene points to something which is	144.6999969482422	499.47967529296875	11.0	398.86024475097656	98
unexpressed and yet symptomatic. In the first place it evaded the perception of	144.6999969482422	513.6796875	11.0	384.6481475830078	98

But if we look at the scene in the context of its multilayered structure, a structural	144.6999969482422	598.5797119140625	11.0	393.61317443847656	99

entails. Against this backdrop, Lou's rather excessive reaction can be seen to	144.6999969482422	655.1796875	11.0	377.08021545410156	99

first few months of life. Thus, through the body's senso-motoric reactions, they	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	382.18421936035156	106
help to shape specific and later-life experiences. Such interaction patterns which	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	391.7211456298828	106
become ingrained in the body stand for an entire lifetime in a constant dialectic	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	383.47108459472656	106
with the discursive demands of the social environment which are subsequently	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	382.2061309814453	106
communicated through language. The start of this development in very early	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	372.09706115722656	106
childhood is both a physical and a holistic process based entirely on sensory	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	372.3610382080078	106
perceptions. In LORENZER's own words, this means that:	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	282.7550506591797	106
"The 'visual', 'tactile', 'acoustic' denote modes of sensory reception, which are	167.39999389648438	590.0361328125	10.0	339.8395690917969	107
directed by the central nervous system from the periphery of the body and which are	167.39999389648438	604.1361083984375	10.0	369.4297180175781	107
then stored in precisely defined 'areas of the brain' (...). The inscription of these	167.39999389648438	618.3360595703125	10.0	347.5295715332031	107
visual, tactile and acoustic impressions happens via 'engrams'. These engrams are	167.39999389648438	632.4360961914062	10.0	365.4097595214844	107
'memory traces' in Freud's terms. Although this process is common to all infants, of	167.39999389648438	646.6361083984375	10.0	365.3897399902344	107
course, the engrams of a single person are the memory traces of his or her	167.39999389648438	660.736083984375	10.0	330.1595153808594	107
experience as a particular individual. They have an individual profile. Just as Freud	167.39999389648438	674.9360961914062	10.0	362.9197082519531	107
pointed out, in front of his time, in his book on 'Aphasie' (Freud, 1891), that cerebral	167.39999389648438	689.0361328125	10.0	366.4796447753906	107
physiological functions and 'psychological' content cannot be separated it is obviously	167.39999389648438	703.236083984375	10.0	374.8296813964844	107
the experiences of the memory traces which are codified as engrams. And this	167.39999389648438	717.3360595703125	10.0	345.3596496582031	107
means that the contents of memory (which is, of course, social) modifies the brain's	167.39999389648438	731.5360717773438	10.0	366.9495544433594	107
physiological structures of the nervous system. And of course the memory traces	167.39999389648438	745.6361083984375	10.0	355.5294494628906	107
combine into ideas of objects. And like the sensual impressions—visual, tactile,	167.39999389648438	759.8360595703125	10.0	348.4497375488281	107

Memory traces are non-verbal references to life practice, of experiences. These	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	388.42115783691406	111

LORENZER emphasizes the "bodilyness" of these processes. LORENZER's	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	372.5590362548828	111
theory of the language development and the notion of scenic understanding are	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	388.0912628173828	111
actually in this sense coming close to contemporary cognitive science and the	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	378.8290557861328	111
new synthesis between "human" and "biological" understanding of the brain	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	368.1591339111328	111
(LORENZER, 2002b). Looked at today, he anticipates a paradigm shift in the	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	375.1812286376953	111
view of the brain as a holistic system (PELED, 2008; LEUZINGER-BOHLEBER	147.8000030517578	306.2796630859375	11.0	385.2809295654297	111
1998). In memory research, embodied cognitive science has moved away from	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	384.84608459472656	111
the notion of the human brain being a kind of computer designed to process	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	370.0291290283203	111
information. Memory is now understood as an active process involving the entire	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	391.41322326660156	111
organism and based on senso-motoric emotion coordination processes which	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	377.59706115722656	111
occur in direct relationship with constantly adapting re-categorization processes.	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	390.26905822753906	111
In LORENZER's terms, this means that a child's early experiences of stimulus	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	379.54420471191406	111
response games with its mother and other close individuals are retained as	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	365.40904235839844	111
memory traces, as specific interaction forms. They are a lasting, natural	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	349.5690460205078	111
impression of genuine social interaction forms in the subject. This is what	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	356.5099639892578	111
LORENZER calls "socialized nature." [36]	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	203.14698791503906	111
But how do single memory traces become a configuration of many which evolve	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	389.2901153564453	112
into life experiences and a complete life world? The notion of the scenic primacy	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	390.7420196533203	112
poses the question the other way round. Experience is holistic, strongly shaped	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	386.16615295410156	112
by sensory impressions and by satisfying (or their opposite) experiences. "The	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	381.63417053222656	112

The self-correction in the quotation (Paragraph 35, italics) is interesting—it seems	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	398.71705627441406	113
that LORENZER here moves from one way of seeing the development of	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	356.32310485839844	113

another, more holistic, in which an undifferentiated scenic experience oriented by	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	394.8781280517578	113
the subject-to-be—gradually evolves through differentiation to become more	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	371.30506896972656	113
detailed and stable object images, and it seems as if the self-correction is a trace	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	395.03211975097656	113
of this theory development. The new conception aligns with empirically based	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	376.6620635986328	113
knowledge about infancy development (STERN, 1985). The process described	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	383.7791290283203	113

1. The imprint of situational experience [Situationserfahrung] is assimilated by an	167.39999389648438	140.33612060546875	10.01470947265625	360.8799743652344	117
internal ensemble of tactile, acoustic etc. receptors. Likewise the receptor	184.39999389648438	154.43609619140625	10.0	323.07952880859375	117
ensemble depicts the panorama of real impressions in the internal scenic	184.39999389648438	168.6361083984375	10.0	321.5996398925781	117

2. Even if not from the first moment but very early these situational engrams	167.39999389648438	200.03607177734375	10.0	339.1595458984375	118
repeatedly go beyond the inevitable dialectic that exists between bodily	184.39999389648438	214.1361083984375	10.0	310.8597106933594	118
sensations and their counter-impulses. The memory trace [Erinnerungsspur] is	184.39999389648438	228.33612060546875	10.01470947265625	345.7900085449219	118
more than the consequence of a simple process of stimulus-response; in itself it	184.39999389648438	242.43609619140625	10.0	351.2796936035156	118
already has sensorimotor qualities. A simple illustration of this scenic composition	184.39999389648438	256.6361083984375	10.0	358.1997375488281	118
of sensorimotor experience formation is to be found in the banal fact that the	184.39999389648438	270.736083984375	10.0	336.0195007324219	118
stimulus is sure to provoke its reaction. For example, the noise of a mouse	184.39999389648438	284.93609619140625	10.0	327.9195251464844	118

3. And the foundation for all this is in the scenic unity between the 'inside' and	167.39999389648438	316.33612060546875	10.0	345.5796813964844	119

foundation for everything. It remains the basic model, from which we will also	184.39999389648438	344.6361083984375	10.0	337.4096374511719	119

The scene is thus shaped by the bodily referent inherent in it from the outset. A	144.6999969482422	386.2796936035156	11.0	385.77015686035156	120
child's earliest perception, no doubt while still in the womb, is a holistic	144.6999969482422	400.47967529296875	11.0	341.8909149169922	120
experience. The perceptive instruments are an ensemble of receptors which give	144.6999969482422	414.5796813964844	11.0	394.3172149658203	120
the external world in intra-psychical space a scenic structure. The bodily	144.6999969482422	428.7796936035156	11.0	351.0980987548828	120
processes described by LORENZER should not, however, be seen as natural or	144.6999969482422	442.87969970703125	11.0	390.2251739501953	120
ingrained reflexes, even if they seem quite similar. The senso-motoric process	144.6999969482422	457.0796813964844	11.0	381.07301330566406	120
can be readily recognized in a nursing mother whose milk production is activated	144.6999969482422	471.1796875	11.0	393.4370880126953	120

breast. The baby's interactive need, the stimulus, is perceived and understood by	144.6999969482422	499.47967529296875	11.0	395.9232940673828	120
the mother as a holistic experience, and her body responds immediately—	144.6999969482422	513.6796875	11.0	362.0431365966797	120
holistically, scenically and faster than it could ever be triggered by any conscious	144.6999969482422	527.7796630859375	11.0	392.63417053222656	120

Hence, this describes the scenic unit between the organism and its environment.	144.6999969482422	570.2796630859375	11.0	392.9861602783203	121
The scene always encompasses both, "internal" and "external," and supports the	144.6999969482422	584.3796997070312	11.0	394.0861358642578	121

human development. This interplay, whether occurring within pre-natal, post-natal or	167.39999389648438	684.236083984375	10.0	369.8697204589844	122

emphasizing the pleasure-unpleasure principle. At the same time he integrates	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	383.92213439941406	126

needs and the social forms in which they can be satisfied and are reconfigured. [41]	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	392.9469757080078	126

interaction with other subjects and the world. But at what point does language	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	378.3231964111328	127
come into the game? The early pre-verbal, scenically stored interaction	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	346.3240203857422	127
experiences, the "specific interaction forms," gradually include verbal images	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	373.90101623535156	127
which appear in the interaction. Simple (pre-symbolic) interaction forms and	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	368.46693420410156	127

This notion leads directly to the concept of the language game LORENZER	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	366.9710235595703	135
developed after WITTGENSTEIN. The latter defined the language game as a	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	377.3660430908203	135
dialectic unit of life practice, language use and world view (2009 [1953]).	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	351.8459930419922	135
WITTGENSTEIN's language game notion was in fact primarily critical to previous	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	395.2741241455078	135
philosophical ideas of language and scientific statements, seeing language	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	365.20008850097656	135
meaning as a result of language use and the social practices in which language	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	387.8601837158203	135
use is inscribed. LORENZER expands this notion by incorporating unconscious	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	385.78114318847656	135
dimensions which were not addressed in WITTGENSTEIN's concept. He sees	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	381.4030303955078	135
the language games not as mere conventions but as dynamic result of a	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	352.62709045410156	135
negotiation between language user with different experiences and practices, and	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	393.2392120361328	135
hence based in these social practices. With LORENZER's extension it means	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	377.5199737548828	135
that this negotiation also involves non- and pre-verbal experiences and also	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	368.10414123535156	135
harbors elements that are products of a destroyed symbolization of experience.	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	386.35316467285156	135

symbolic interaction form, but actually contains it. For this reason the pre-	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0162353515625	357.85609436035156	135
symbolic interaction form remains virulent one's whole life long, is inseparably	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	378.3560333251953	135
linked to subsequent, development history-related verbal expression or, being	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	378.7851104736328	135
excluded from the language symbol spectrum, seeks out other-than-verbal ways	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	391.2812042236328	135
of finding expression. Today, it is not only clinicians but also social researchers	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	384.3180694580078	135
who describe this form of active expression as "enactments." They are the	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	361.99913024902344	135
unconscious, soulless repetition of interaction experiences that the subject, either	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	396.30824279785156	135
in times of great need or in response to emotional pain, has tended to separate,	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	388.75123596191406	135
disassociate or repress. While they cannot, therefore, be integrated into the	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	368.40113830566406	135
individual processing and development process, they nonetheless shape that	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	375.4741973876953	135

If, as described earlier, the early interaction experience cannot be symbolized it	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	386.15516662597656	136
still remains an action-driving component of the individual-subjective structures	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	383.60304260253906	136

in the subject's inability to reflect on those experience forms. The subject is not	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	384.0871124267578	136
able to draw upon practice through language. At the same time, as LORENZER	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	388.4099884033203	136
repeatedly emphasizes, the non-verbal interaction form is always linked to	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	360.8329315185547	136
subsequent language symbolic forms. The ability to express one self verbally and	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	396.80311584472656	136
pre-verbally involves many other aspects. The language game as a concept to	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	382.17323303222656	136

behavior. More precisely, the model of the language-game characterizes	185.5	140.33612060546875	10.0	318.70965576171875	140
individual structures as sedimented versions of concrete interactions (as	185.5	154.43609619140625	10.0	317.59967041015625	140

useful backdrop that renders visible what was previously opaque, namely the	185.5	302.1361083984375	10.0	337.56964111328125	142
active making of configurations of consciousness as they emerge in practices	185.5	316.33612060546875	10.0	340.5596923828125	142

The term language game thus refers to three dimensions of the social: the	144.6999969482422	357.97967529296875	11.0	362.32911682128906	143

practice. In LORENZER's work, we learned that individual structure is expression	144.6999969482422	386.2796936035156	11.0	394.6691436767578	143
of real interaction experiences from early life onwards. Social experiences in their	144.6999969482422	400.47967529296875	11.0	395.83509826660156	143

generalized. Through conscious verbal action, these also bring a social practice	144.6999969482422	428.7796936035156	11.0	388.1350860595703	143
to light on which they are also based. Language games can thus only be	144.6999969482422	442.87969970703125	11.0	353.4631805419922	143
understood in their social context. They assume a common practice-based	144.6999969482422	457.0796813964844	11.0	363.6490936279297	143

game can be identified. The symbolic unit is dissolved when it is subject to	144.6999969482422	513.6796875	11.0	362.42796325683594	143

"When the word is separated from the interaction engram the latter once again	167.39999389648438	556.8360595703125	10.0	345.1396179199219	144
becomes an unconscious interaction form. The word, for its part, loses its relation to	167.39999389648438	571.0361328125	10.0	368.7695007324219	144
sensual practice, it becomes emotionless, an empty sign. Thus the interaction	167.39999389648438	585.1361083984375	10.000015258789062	341.8896484375	144

from its relation to the word, i.e. through its introduction into the meaning system of	167.39999389648438	613.4360961914062	10.0	363.4895324707031	144

symbolized language signs suffer the opposite fate. They remain in the conscious,	167.39999389648438	670.0361328125	10.0	360.7496643066406	144
where they can be easily manipulated because they have been freed from their	167.39999389648438	684.236083984375	10.0	346.8296813964844	144

LORENZER describes the characterized division between words and interaction	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0	389.6531524658203	147

The destruction of this symbolic unit reverses symbolization, hence the term	144.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	370.3371124267578	147
"desymbolization," and it may occur during (subjective) conflicts later in life. This	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	390.6430206298828	147
means that once achieved, the ability to symbolize (verbal expression of a	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	360.15101623535156	147
subjective structure) is withdrawn in relation to a specific problem which the	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	366.97096252441406	147
individual experiences as an inner conflict. The ability to express an experience or	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	398.6292266845703	147
an emotional process in words is lost in connection with the issue causing the	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	377.5089874267578	147
conflict. Conflict in this sense is seen as the situated clash of irreconcilable,	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	366.8610382080078	147
contradictory interaction forms. [47]	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	172.7469940185547	147
Interaction forms which are symbolized in language figures can thus be re-	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	363.8800506591797	148
excluded from the language context. This happens with the aid of resistance	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	371.9210968017578	148
mechanisms: by repressing them, they are excluded from the conscious	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	350.93309020996094	148
relationship between language and practice. Although this turns them back into	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	385.42921447753906	148
unconscious interaction forms, the very fact of this reversion allows them to retain	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	397.61720275878906	148
their energetic, dynamic relevance. They act as behavior drivers, albeit in the	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	375.10011291503906	148
form of blind action and reaction which is not open to conscious self-reflection.	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	381.73304748535156	148
For the individual, the recurring unconscious reenactment of a scene whose	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	369.77613830566406	148
structure is similar to the actual conflict, appears in the form of need for	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	347.35813903808594	148
repetition. [48]	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	69.94700622558594	148
Symbolization through language has the advantage of being brought to mind	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	373.97816467285156	149
independently of the real situation and thus fulfills an important function in the	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	377.5971221923828	149
regulation of emotion. In other words, it assists the subject's independence	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	364.28709411621094	149
(tentative action, hesitation). By separating the language from the interaction	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	373.32911682128906	149
form, the person is again made dependent from the effects of unconscious	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	364.1881866455078	149
conflict. He or she rarely has the power to free themselves from the dynamics of	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	390.43409729003906	149
the unconscious scenic processes. This is in worst case the type of problems in	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	387.71705627441406	149

The described division of the symbolic unit in the language game is evident in the	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	396.2201690673828	150

structures of a text and is characterized by the fact that it excludes the interaction	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	395.9562530517578	150

understanding. The spoken word is no longer understandable for the listener or	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	386.26515197753906	150
reader. The societal reference of collective meaning dimensions and a social	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	374.2751007080078	150

symbolized language figures? A means of access is needed that reidentifies the	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	389.7632598876953	151
scenic unit, including when there is no or only an altered form of verbal	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	344.76206970214844	151
expression because the unit of language symbolic and interaction form has been	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	393.36024475097656	151
lost. This is where LORENZER's idea of scenic understanding has its	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	337.5019989013672	151

particularly when he summarized his ideas in 1986, was the possibility to learn	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	381.2050323486328	155
from the type of hermeneutic process in psychoanalysis for the analysis of	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	361.33912658691406	155
cultural phenomena.	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	99.7259521484375	155
"In the psychoanalytic process, all understanding centers on and is related to the	167.39999389648438	207.93609619140625	10.0	353.7696228027344	156
mode of 'scenic understanding'. In this mode understanding is attuned to two specific	167.39999389648438	222.1361083984375	10.0	373.2596130371094	156
objects: the 'scenic drafts', i.e. the 'interaction forms' of the analysand. Particularly	167.39999389648438	236.236083984375	10.0	359.2295227050781	156
hereby psychoanalysis provides us with a model example. If we want to understand	167.39999389648438	250.43609619140625	10.0	366.0295715332031	156
the analysand's life-practice, which does not exclude his concrete social reality, we	167.39999389648438	264.53607177734375	10.0	362.5697937011719	156
must follow the path laid down by his subjective phantasies and outlines of relations.	167.39999389648438	278.736083984375	10.0	369.5198059082031	156
This means we must become attuned to his scenic interaction forms as these unfold	167.39999389648438	292.83612060546875	10.0	370.4095764160156	156
before us" (1977, p.125). [52]	167.39999389648438	307.03607177734375	10.0	129.07000732421875	156
What in this quotation is described as a therapeutic approach in the analyst's	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	374.9131622314453	157

human behavior. Immediately, the question arises as to how a mode of	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	345.8511199951172	157
understanding can be practiced which explores the scenic in a non-clinical	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	361.4049530029297	157
context. LORENZER and his colleagues have demonstrated the approach in	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	372.6471710205078	157
relation to literary texts and cultural phenomena (LORENZER, 1986; PROKOP et	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	395.2959747314453	157
al., 2009), and we have taken it a bit further into qualitative social research in a	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	384.1420440673828	157
number of more profane contexts. In the following I shall discuss the	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	332.98106384277344	157
methodology of scenic understanding and its practical implementation. In other	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	384.17518615722656	157
words, how could qualitative social research understand unknown subjective	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	372.27296447753906	157
content and processes which include the unconscious and draw attention to non-	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	394.05323791503906	157
verbal messages. [53]	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	108.0469970703125	157
Like every hermeneutic approach it is about understanding the meaning in	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	361.95506286621094	158
agency and expressions, and in practical social research. Although some	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	356.18003845214844	158
measures can be taken to make the data suitable scenic understanding can be	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	385.14320373535156	158
applicable to almost any text or phenomenon referring to agency and subjective	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	388.33326721191406	158
expression. The prototypical material is, though, a text, or can be seen as a text.	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	391.50123596191406	158
More exotic ways of producing the data in the first place are videos or	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	339.0530548095703	158
conversations held while observing videos (second order field observation). Very	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	392.5351104736328	158
often the text is a transcript of a focus group discussion or thematic group	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	359.0401153564453	158
discussion. In other cases it may be an interview—individual or collective—or it	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	383.80104064941406	158
may be a field diary from an observation. [54]	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	221.04701232910156	158
To identify the meaning structure of a text, we may distinguish different levels of	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	389.3560333251953	159
interpretation:	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	67.3089599609375	159
1. The obvious referential content of the text: What is being talked about?	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	363.2801055908203	160
2. How do people talk to one another? This question on the meta-communicative	144.6999969482422	733.8796997070312	11.0	398.5242462158203	160
content of a text takes us to the level of scenic understanding.	161.6999969482422	747.979736328125	11.0	302.1700897216797	160

3. Why are the characters talking in precisely this way? How can we understand	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0	394.57508850097656	163
it by means of theoretical knowledge combined with background factual	161.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	348.5349884033203	163
knowledge? The first of these steps is the same as in most types of qualitative	161.6999969482422	136.47967529296875	11.0	381.62330627441406	163
method. [55]	161.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	61.44700622558594	163
Step 3 might in its form remind about an explanatory approach which seeks a	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	377.42115783691406	164
causal or rule-based understanding. Since it is a hermeneutic methodology this is	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	396.8141632080078	164
not the case, instead it is a more comprehensive multilayered interpretation	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	366.5750274658203	164
enabled by Step 2. The scenic understanding focuses on the ongoing tense	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	368.9951934814453	164
relation between the manifest and the unconscious meanings of a text which	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	372.82313537597656	164
requires an imagination of the unconscious that we can imagine as a collective	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	383.4270782470703	164
reservoir of culturally rejected patterns, forbidden yearnings and suppressed	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	371.6791534423828	164
desires. In-depth hermeneutic interpretation thus focuses on the characters in the	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	397.3533477783203	164
relationship described in the text and on the dynamics of the relationship between	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	397.7162628173828	164
a text and its interpreter(s) in order to trace the subjective structure of cultural	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	377.2230987548828	164
constraints. [56]	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	78.0469970703125	164
The reference point in the scenic interpretation is the language used in the text,	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	386.8151397705078	165
with particular attention being placed on how scenes in the text point to	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	345.75209045410156	165
unexpressed desires and tensions, on how the text arranges "forms of	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	342.05613708496094	165
communication which makes the unspeakable" understandable, or "secures it an	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	393.7233428955078	165
unnegligible position in public space" as LORENZER says about the task of the	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	386.65016174316406	165
poet (1986, p.24). The initial reading seeks to apply the same type of free-floating	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	397.5622100830078	165
awareness [gleichschwebende Aufmerksamkeit] as is known from the clinical	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0162353515625	375.9560089111328	165
situation: observations of the text and of one's own reactions are noted without	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	382.9652862548828	165
coming immediately to any particular conclusions or forming theoretical	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	346.4340362548828	165
definitions. Indications of hidden conflict dynamics include gaps, inconsistencies,	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	393.0081329345703	165
unusual use of language, jumps in the story or sudden changes of subject, and	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	385.42921447753906	165
remarkable ways of relating to the subject or to each other (in case of group	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	370.2360382080078	165
interaction texts). But also the reactions, emotional states and associations of the	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	396.0003204345703	165
readers/interpreters may be indications of the dynamics we are looking for—even	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	396.28614807128906	165
if you cannot immediately understand them (compare KÖNIG, 2008, Sections 8-	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	390.85218811035156	165
10). Practically an interpretation procedure is most often organized in a group.	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	380.4021759033203	165
Some procedures go line by line, seeking to understand each unit of text, and	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	378.2351837158203	165
revising the understanding gradually as the later segments are taken into	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	356.0920867919922	165
consideration. Other procedures start by an open conversation conveying "first	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	382.87721252441406	165
impressions" and reactions from the members of the interpretation group. In	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	370.3151397705078	165
some cases you will experience that controversies and conflicts arise within an	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	382.6791534423828	165
interpretation group, evoked by the text. Using these observations and reactions	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	390.6981964111328	165
as a base, particularly powerful passages are subjected to in-depth analysis in	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	381.38111877441406	165
interpretation groups (a similarly procedure is described in MARKS & MÖNNICH-	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	394.72389221191406	165
MARKS, 2003). What has already been described as the transference between	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	386.5513458251953	165
the individual reader and the text is now transferred to a collective understanding	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	393.4262237548828	165
process: the transference and counter-transference dynamics multiply. This	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	368.3570098876953	165
procedure may lead very directly to "holistic" but preliminary interpretations that	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	385.80311584472656	165
are set under discussion, or it may produce several "loose ends." The	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	339.14109802246094	165
interpretation discussion most likely includes reference to the concrete text and	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	385.27516174316406	165
its manifest meaning, and it may very well also draw on theoretical frameworks	144.6999969482422	773.1796875	10.999996185302734	383.58106994628906	165

component. This is the methodological bridge which enables the unconscious	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	377.5861358642578	169
dimensions of experience to be accessed from language. They can also be	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	366.58607482910156	169

individual meaning contained in a specific scene. The language figure then	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	364.5620574951172	169

interpreters were led into both an individual psychological reductive interpretation,	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	397.22120666503906	170
and into a cultural criticism against the seductive effects of TV shows like Big	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	375.15504455566406	170
Brother. We eventually resisted the temptations to leave it there. Led by the	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	368.4561309814453	170
theoretical points of Alfred LORENZER we developed a more comprehensive	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	376.72804260253906	170
psycho-societal interpretation which in no way excludes some regressive aspects	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	395.3400421142578	170
in the TV audience, and definitely does not exclude a critique of the quality and	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	384.75819396972656	170
the political dimensions of the TV shows. But we wanted to find the collective or	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	387.4420928955078	170
societal unconscious mechanism that the show (re)activates in Lou as in	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	353.0451202392578	170
everybody else, and we wanted to understand why this led her to act in this	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	366.10203552246094	170
enraged and seemingly irrational way—and in this sense we also wanted to	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	367.34498596191406	170
rehabilitate Lou as a subject in relation to her violation of good civil behavior,	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	372.7019805908203	170
assuming that she was enacting something that was collective and could not be	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	388.24513244628906	170
explained and reasoned. Referring to LORENZER's development of the language	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	397.6391143798828	170
game concept we would seek to trace the relation between the manifest language	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	398.7722930908203	170
meanings in her account, the societal meanings that are relegated to	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	335.42308044433594	170
unconscious interaction forms pushing on conscious recognition—and the wider	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	389.33424377441406	170
societal practice in which the language use makes sense. [59]	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	302.64698791503906	170
A lot of energy in the story told is condensed in Lou's sentence: "I just wanted her	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	397.12232971191406	171
out"—Lou's emotional engagement seems condensed in it, and the plot of the	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	379.53321838378906	171
scene seems driven by or explained by this sentence. [60]	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	283.14698791503906	171
On the one hand the words seem harmless. They refer to the rules of games	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	374.2311553955078	172
which are in broad use and enjoy great social acceptance. Through play, children	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	396.0552520751953	172

courage. It is a standard pattern in the type of TV shows to which Big Brother	144.6999969482422	108.1796875	11.0	375.68299865722656	175
belongs, and has spread to be one of the standard storylines of so called	144.6999969482422	122.2796630859375	11.0	355.5420684814453	175

On the other hand Lou's words supported by characteristic behavior gives the	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	378.0591583251953	176
spoken words an explosiveness which seems—guided by the theory of	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	345.2130584716797	176
interaction forms and language—to indicate a further meaning than the	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	345.97206115722656	176
immediate referential one: The scene that Lou describes (which is told as having	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	392.49122619628906	176
taken place in the recent past) seems to have harbored a trigger stimulus which	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	388.45411682128906	176
forced Lou to act impulsively. Her behavior seemed designed to ensure that	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	369.16004943847656	176

replaces symbolic reflection. This behavior, within a classical psycho-analytical	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	382.95399475097656	176
horizon, recalls the link between oedipal conflict issues from the childhood: the	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	382.6350860595703	176
daughter wants to push the mother out to more easily gain the father's favor. The	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	395.5271759033203	176
intruder is to be destroyed. Lou might have such an individual version of a	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	359.9420623779297	176
standard socialization experience. Although convenient, this dramatic constellation	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	393.46974182128906	176
from each childhood triangularization phase would be reductive and not lend a	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	381.18312072753906	176
cultural analytic perspective to the understanding. Instead we should look for a	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	382.80018615722656	176
potential correspondence between the individual subjective dynamic and societal	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	393.5362091064453	176
meanings that are implicitly present in the social setting of the TV show. We are	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	389.0480499267578	176
looking for the supra-individual, societal meaning of the story Lou tells, although	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	389.10316467285156	176
indirectly. The analysis so far seemed to show that the TV show (cultural	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	353.84803771972656	176
meaning) elicits unconscious desires and identifications (interaction forms) which	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	394.1961212158203	176
influence the agency and produces an intense ambivalence. The reconstruction	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	387.5852813720703	176
of this ambivalence should help reveal the unconscious in the text. [62]	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	345.2469940185547	176
If we recall the interpretations used at the beginning of this paper, the dynamic of	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	394.8782501220703	177
inclusion and exclusion runs through all interpretations of the text sequence. The	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	393.4042510986328	177
TV games are about excluding others, exclusion is an important part of the game.	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	397.91419982910156	177
This is bound up with the setting of norms which sanction the exclusion of others.	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	395.70314025878906	177
The mass viewer participation seems to indicate not only social acceptance but	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	385.37416076660156	177
also a widespread need to be included in the game of excluding others. Lou	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	369.2920684814453	177
serves as an exemplary viewer and contestant—she stands for more than just	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	380.07215881347656	177
herself, in that her reaction is representative of the desired inclusion of viewers in	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	395.15309143066406	177
the game. It seems justified to see Lou's actions and the key statement as part of	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	396.36329650878906	177
a language game in LORENZER's sense—combining the explicit and manifest	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	382.87696838378906	177
meaning with experiences of winning inclusion by joining the exclusion of others,	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	391.98500061035156	177
and a societal perspective in a neo-liberal society where separation prevails over	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	392.9201202392578	177
integration. But we may also interpret her reactions so that the participation in this	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	398.1342315673828	177
language game elicits ambivalent feelings. We can relate it to the moral paradox	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	392.16114807128906	177
that the exclusive action is justified by the defense for the moral integrity in the	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	381.8430938720703	177
community in the TV show container. [63]	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	202.44700622558594	177
With the positive evaluation of what is generally seen as negative behavior	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	363.61607360839844	178
(exclusion), a door is opened to judgmental and stereotypical attitudes in	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	353.9361114501953	178
everyday life which allow the unknown and the foreign to be negated without	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	371.66810607910156	178
punishment and eventually to be eliminated. The definition of foreign, unknown	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	384.0320587158203	178
elements as a justification for exclusion is reminiscent of the well-known studies	144.6999969482422	773.1796875	10.999996185302734	388.1790313720703	178

collectively fascinating TV game which not only uses this projection mechanism	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	386.5620880126953	182
but nurtures it under greenhouse-like conditions helps foster general acceptance	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	392.94227600097656	182
of archaic, collective defensive formations. The consciousness and norms which	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	391.23719787597656	182
are communicated no longer need be subjected to conscious, reflective reality	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	380.5010528564453	182
checks. Through mass fascination and the social practice it is based upon, it	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	372.14100646972656	182
appears adequately legitimated. [65]	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	177.94700622558594	182
When we finally returned to the relation of the interpretation group: Do we also	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	382.14015197753906	183
have a share in the exclusion game? The individual ”clinical” interpretation of the	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	392.2160186767578	183
case can be recognized as a defense against the collective regression whose	144.6999969482422	447.7796936035156	11.0	377.68507385253906	183
analysis triggered outrage among the interpreters themselves. Whereas the	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	369.5451202392578	183
interpretation of an immature, oedipal conflict constellation or an unguided	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	361.4160614013672	183
individual loss of control based on a simple identification appears quite harmless.	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	394.7240753173828	183
Recognizing the collective nature of the unspoken interaction forms, and the	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	371.5141143798828	183
ambivalence in Lou's actions also makes visible that she is actually also—	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	360.95399475097656	183
utopian?—longing for community and integration. [66]	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	262.3470001220703	183
In our fellow interpreters' account (BERESWILL, MORGENROTH & REDMAN,	144.6999969482422	560.9796752929688	11.0	383.49281311035156	184

process in the interpretation community and the interplay between the scenes in	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	389.90614318847656	184
the TV-show, the scene in which Lou acts, and the scene of interpreting. This is	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	388.05812072753906	184

interpreters and text take advantage of the scenic imagination. Here we	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	348.5900115966797	184
emphasize the aspect of theoretical guidance because the theoretical framework	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	393.3382110595703	184
and the psycho-societal methodological ambition—including LORENZER's notion	144.6999969482422	659.979736328125	11.0	395.8791046142578	184
of the collective unconscious and the scenic—really were imperatives which	144.6999969482422	674.1796875	11.0	368.98402404785156	184
helped the interpreter group to look for the traces of the extended language game	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	398.45326232910156	184
in the text which did not appear easily. And this seems to be an essential lesson	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	389.7411651611328	184

Alfred LORENZER's contribution enriches the interpretational social science with	144.6999969482422	150.5797119140625	11.0	392.88722229003906	188
a new theory and some quite practical inspiration for dealing empirically with the	144.6999969482422	164.7796630859375	11.0	389.6859893798828	188
subjective aspects of social agency and interaction. This is in itself highly	144.6999969482422	178.87969970703125	11.0	355.2009735107422	188
appreciated. Many qualitative methods tend to take their	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	274.0430145263672	188
informants/narrators/sources for granted, and to neglect the involvement of the	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	384.27430725097656	188
researcher subject as well (BREUER, MRUCK & ROTH, 2002). The awareness	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	386.99085998535156	188
of an epistemic subject-object-relativity is growing, and research activity is also	144.6999969482422	235.47967529296875	11.0	383.8009796142578	188
increasingly recognized as a social practice in it self (ROTH & BREUER, 2003),	144.6999969482422	249.6796875	11.0	387.29884338378906	188
but the contributions providing tools provided for reflecting researcher subjectivity	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	395.75807189941406	188
seem insufficient. LORENZER, among others, problematizes the subject category	144.6999969482422	277.97967529296875	11.0	399.06922912597656	188
—both the subjects in the text and the subjects who are researching— redefining	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	394.68031311035156	188
the need for reflection into an empirical issue. He takes over the Wittgensteinian	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	390.85218811035156	188
notions of language use and language games, and anchors them in the	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	348.4801483154297	188
socialization and the mediation of societal culture which for the individual may	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	377.9159698486328	188
take conscious as well as unconscious forms. Applying this extended notion of	144.6999969482422	348.6796875	11.0	381.88722229003906	188
language use and language game he opens a new window to the epistemic	144.6999969482422	362.87969970703125	11.0	367.89503479003906	188
process—the condition of knowing is founded in the materiality of the cultural	144.6999969482422	376.97967529296875	11.0	375.00099182128906	188
reproduction, including the researcher subject experiencing in the medium of (a)	144.6999969482422	391.1796875	11.0	390.3681182861328	188
language (game) and developing it. It seems also that in this way relativist	144.6999969482422	405.2796936035156	11.0	360.65699768066406	188
excesses of some contemporary constructivism can be avoided by redefining the	144.6999969482422	419.47967529296875	11.0	394.3172149658203	188
relativity issue into an empirical one. [68]	144.6999969482422	433.5796813964844	11.0	198.54701232910156	188
LORENZER goes one step deeper in theorizing the societal framework of	144.6999969482422	461.87969970703125	11.0	358.23707580566406	189
understanding the subjects—or rather the subjectivities. In this way it also seems	144.6999969482422	476.0796813964844	11.0	394.48207092285156	189
as if he avoids the risk that made BERGER and LUCKMANN (1966) warn so	144.6999969482422	490.1796875	11.0	373.80189514160156	189
strongly against the alliance with psycho-analysis, the risk of reducing subjectivity	144.6999969482422	504.37969970703125	11.0	396.70399475097656	189
to a mechanical "natural" causality. It seems that his consequent material and	144.6999969482422	518.4796752929688	11.0	378.5982208251953	189
endogenous notion of the unconscious enables a clearly hermeneutic stance	144.6999969482422	532.6796875	11.0	374.02223205566406	189
without giving up the bodily dimensions of the human subjectivity. [69]	144.6999969482422	546.7796630859375	11.0	340.3470001220703	189
BERGER and LUCKMANN's comments are particularly interesting because their	144.6999969482422	575.0797119140625	11.000015258789062	392.7661895751953	190
book has been assigned the honor to be the first main work of constructivism.	144.6999969482422	589.2797241210938	11.0	378.41102600097656	190
Both LORENZER and BERGER and LUCKMANN anticipate the poststructuralist	144.6999969482422	603.3796997070312	11.0	391.67701721191406	190
critique of Marxism. And we think that LORENZER—exactly by building on the	144.6999969482422	617.5797119140625	11.0	381.00709533691406	190
psychoanalysis that BERGER and LUCKMANN warned against—produced an	144.6999969482422	631.6796875	11.0	381.7110137939453	190
alternative answer to their ambition of unified social theory theorizing the agency-	144.6999969482422	645.8796997070312	11.0	395.37318420410156	190

It is contested if BERGER and LUCKMANN's book actually belongs to the	144.6999969482422	688.2797241210938	11.0	360.1070098876953	191
tradition of social constructivism (COLLIN, 2002), but at least it has been possible	144.6999969482422	702.479736328125	11.0	397.59523010253906	191
to interpret it into that framework. It seems more appropriate to see their book as	144.6999969482422	716.5797119140625	11.000007629394531	393.51417541503906	191
a precursor, which made visible the wider consequences for social theory of	144.6999969482422	730.7797241210938	11.000007629394531	369.5780792236328	191
theorizing knowledge as a societal phenomenon. North American constructivism	144.6999969482422	744.8796997070312	11.0	391.00611877441406	191
has developed this into an epistemology in which the role of	144.6999969482422	759.0797119140625	11.000007629394531	290.90599060058594	191

constructivism, with the social philosophy of the Frankfurt School in several	144.6999969482422	193.0797119140625	11.0	366.0360870361328	195
generations as a backbone (ADORNO, 1976 [1969]). It may partly be seen as a	144.6999969482422	207.1796875	11.0	388.69618225097656	195
difference between an American tradition in which G.H.MEAD is a both	144.6999969482422	221.37969970703125	11.0	345.5208282470703	195

LORENZER's social psychology would be really interesting. The adoption or	144.6999969482422	263.7796630859375	11.0	370.71107482910156	195

social seems to be distinctive. ADORNO's theoretical integration of	144.6999969482422	292.0797119140625	11.0	325.9239959716797	195
psychoanalytical theory into sociology was connected with the need to	144.6999969482422	306.2796630859375	11.0	341.4619903564453	195
understand the psychic mechanisms which enabled the political success of	144.6999969482422	320.37969970703125	11.0	365.02406311035156	195
Nazism. ADORNO in his own empirical research into the social psychology of	144.6999969482422	334.5796813964844	11.0	377.0251007080078	195
