Jewish ritual methods of slaughter are considered unacceptable by a number of	128.6999969482422	115.3145751953125	9.48004150390625	303.6291961669922	8
groups concerned with the suffering of animals. Indeed, ritual methods of	128.6999969482422	126.83465576171875	9.48004150390625	303.61875915527344	8
slaughtering require that animals be slaughtered without having been stunned,	128.6999969482422	138.2950439453125	9.48004150390625	303.5875701904297	8
thus causing significant pain during their slaughter.3	128.6999969482422	147.9815673828125	11.3135986328125	198.0600128173828	8
On the one hand, ritual slaughter seems to be unacceptable not only to those	140.04005432128906	161.33465576171875	9.48004150390625	292.2626495361328	8
concerned with animal rights, who reject any kind of killing of animals, but	128.7000732421875	172.7950439453125	9.48004150390625	303.6671142578125	8
also to those with more moderate worries for the welfare of animals, who might	128.7000732421875	184.31512451171875	9.48004150390625	303.6889953613281	8
allow the killing of animals but are concerned with their suffering. On the other	128.7000732421875	195.835205078125	9.48004150390625	303.4964904785156	8
hand, ritual slaughter seems to be justified insofar as it is an expression of the	128.7000732421875	207.29559326171875	9.48004150390625	303.6519775390625	8
right to freedom of religion. Hence, there seems to be a clash between the right	128.7000732421875	218.815673828125	9.48004150390625	303.6101989746094	8
to religious freedom and the widespread concern for animal welfare.	128.7000732421875	230.33575439453125	9.48004150390625	260.183349609375	8
In this paper I propose a conditional solution to this clash between values.	140.04005432128906	241.796142578125	9.48004150390625	292.2209930419922	8
Before presenting my argument, I want to emphasize that I will not argue for	128.7000732421875	253.31622314453125	9.48004150390625	303.7144775390625	8
the overall admissibility of ritual slaughter. My claim will be more limited: I	128.7000732421875	264.8363037109375	9.48004150390625	303.6927490234375	8
will try to see whether ritual slaughter can be made compatible with a general	128.7000732421875	276.29669189453125	9.48004150390625	303.631103515625	8
concern for animal welfare. In a sense my claim will rest within the boundaries	128.7000732421875	287.8167724609375	9.48004150390625	303.629150390625	8
of non-ideal theory, because I will accept most of the current rules and practic-	128.7000732421875	299.33685302734375	9.48004150390625	303.5874328613281	8
es surrounding the relation between humans and animals. In other words, I will	128.7000732421875	310.7972412109375	9.48004150390625	303.59503173828125	8
propose an improvement of the current system of raising animals that does not	128.7000732421875	322.31732177734375	9.480010986328125	303.4850769042969	8
challenge its justification.	128.7000732421875	333.8374328613281	9.47998046875	97.87815856933594	8
To do this, I will start from the uncontroversial assumption that qua general	140.04005432128906	345.29779052734375	9.47998046875	292.24940490722656	8
principles both the right to freedom of religion and the concern for animal	128.7000732421875	356.81787109375	9.47998046875	303.53912353515625	8
welfare are sound and justified. I will also assume that neither animal welfare	128.7000732421875	368.33795166015625	9.47998046875	303.69085693359375	8
nor religious freedom have priority; rather, I will assume that they are on an	128.7000732421875	379.7983093261719	9.47998046875	303.5268249511719	8
equal footing. This does not mean that I am subscribing to a form of metaethi-	128.7000732421875	391.3183898925781	9.47998046875	303.65576171875	8
cal pluralism. I will simply take their clash at face value. To argue for the prior-	128.7000732421875	402.8384704589844	9.47998046875	303.74957275390625	8
ity of one over the other we would need a complete and substantive theory of	128.7000732421875	414.298828125	9.47998046875	303.5846252441406	8
justice. In this paper my aim is obviously much more modest. Indeed I will	128.7000732421875	425.81890869140625	9.47998046875	303.7391052246094	8
only discuss whether they can be made compatible without arguing for the	128.7000732421875	437.3389892578125	9.47998046875	303.5893249511719	8
priority of one over the other.	128.7000732421875	448.7993469238281	9.47998046875	112.36738586425781	8
To understand whether they can be made compatible in the case of ritual	140.04005432128906	460.3194274902344	9.47998046875	292.2475128173828	8
slaughter we need to establish what exactly they demand of us. In the light of	128.7000732421875	471.8395080566406	9.47998046875	303.6300964355469	8
this, I will argue that there is no convincing reason to consider the suffering	128.7000732421875	483.29986572265625	9.47998046875	303.5865478515625	8
involved in the killing of animals more important than other types of suffering	128.7000732421875	494.8199462890625	9.47998046875	303.5267333984375	8
they face during their lives (on farms). If so, to make ritual slaughter compati-	128.7000732421875	506.34002685546875	9.47998046875	303.6150207519531	8
ble, at least in principle, with concerns for animal welfare, I will argue that we	128.7000732421875	517.8004150390625	9.47998046875	303.63482666015625	8
might demand that ritually slaughtered animals be “compensated” for their	128.7000732421875	529.3204345703125	9.47998046875	303.6394958496094	8
3 Although some people claim that, if the slaughter is performed appropriately, the suffering	128.6999969482422	557.21484375	9.6839599609375	303.6222381591797	9
of ritually slaughtered animals is not significantly greater than that suffered by animals	137.22015380859375	568.2186889648438	7.97998046875	295.0755920410156	9

and faith. Rather, it includes a number of more specific rights, such as the right	128.6999969482422	266.87518310546875	9.48004150390625	303.62730407714844	14
to gather and pray in public. Among these rights we can include the right to eat	128.6999969482422	278.3355712890625	9.48004150390625	303.4965362548828	14
and follow the dietary prescriptions of one’s religion. Accordingly, ritual	128.6999969482422	289.85565185546875	9.48004150390625	303.5856170654297	14
slaughter is an expression of this general right. But there seems to be a case for	128.6999969482422	301.375732421875	9.48004150390625	303.58277893066406	14
its limitation. Religious freedom is thought to be inviolable to the extent that its	128.6999969482422	312.83612060546875	9.48004150390625	303.64817810058594	14
exercise does not infringe upon other rights and the fundamental interests of	128.6999969482422	324.356201171875	9.480010986328125	303.5817413330078	14
others. One might say that ritual slaughter is wrong precisely because it in-	128.6999969482422	335.8763122558594	9.47998046875	303.65098571777344	14
fringes upon the rights of animals. However, it is not clear whether animals	128.6999969482422	347.336669921875	9.47998046875	303.6139678955078	14
hold rights. The least we can say is that this is a controversial claim and there is	128.6999969482422	358.85675048828125	9.47998046875	303.6330108642578	14
a deep disagreement about this issue.4 Irrespective of whether animals hold	128.6999969482422	368.5415344238281	11.315277099609375	303.55064392089844	14
rights, however, most Western legislation displays a concern for animal welfare	128.70013427734375	381.8349609375	9.47998046875	303.7126159667969	14
that seems to be related to duties on the part of human beings. However, it is	128.70013427734375	393.35504150390625	9.47998046875	303.6575927734375	14
not clear what justification might ground such a concern. Is it couched on a	128.70013427734375	404.8751220703125	9.47998046875	303.5941162109375	14
rights-based view or on utilitarian grounds?	128.70013427734375	416.3354797363281	9.47998046875	165.958740234375	14
On the one hand, it certainly cannot be defended on a standard rights-based	140.0401153564453	427.8555603027344	9.47998046875	292.2844696044922	14
view, because current rights-based views do not only demand that we take	128.70013427734375	439.3756408691406	9.47998046875	303.6453552246094	14
animal welfare and suffering into account; they also argue that animals have an	128.70013427734375	450.83599853515625	9.47998046875	303.5486145019531	14
inviolable right to life. On the other hand, one might think that an interest in	128.70013427734375	462.3560791015625	9.47998046875	303.6168518066406	14
animal welfare and suffering is typically utilitarian. However, we might ask	128.70013427734375	473.87615966796875	9.47998046875	303.6329650878906	14
whether such a utilitarian view should be applied only to animals or also in other	128.70013427734375	485.3365173339844	9.47998046875	303.6310729980469	14
domains. But, since utilitarianism is an all-encompassing and monist theory, it	128.70013427734375	496.8565979003906	9.47998046875	303.7221374511719	14
cannot only be applied to one domain (viz. animals) and not to other relevantly	128.70013427734375	508.376708984375	9.47998046875	303.7115478515625	14
similar domains (namely all sentient beings including human beings). In a word,	128.70013427734375	519.8370361328125	9.47998046875	303.7108459472656	14

ment to anti-speciesism held by many utilitarians. Thus, if we want a utilitarian	128.6999969482422	115.3145751953125	9.48004150390625	303.7164764404297	17
justification of the treatment of animals, we must also be prepared to accept a	128.6999969482422	126.83465576171875	9.48004150390625	303.5988311767578	17
utilitarian justification in other fields of public ethics. But this would be quite	128.69998168945312	138.2950439453125	9.48004150390625	303.6671447753906	17
unpalatable for many of us. Thus, although certain types of utilitarianism could	128.69998168945312	149.81512451171875	9.48004150390625	303.65472412109375	17

5 However, there is no coherent application of the indirect approach because such articles, as	128.6999969482422	473.5149230957031	9.683837890625	303.63658142089844	18

their nature and that cause great suffering, point also at a direct approach. The reference to	137.2201690673828	493.8185729980469	7.97998046875	295.10044860839844	18
animals’ ethological nature and specific needs is interpreted in the jurisprudence as a clear	137.2201690673828	503.11846923828125	7.97998046875	295.1746368408203	18

6 An even clearer example of the direct approach is the Swiss Federal Law (455, 16 December	128.6999969482422	520.0147705078125	9.68389892578125	303.64927673339844	18

7 One prominent case is the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz), which demands that animals be	128.6999969482422	547.914794921875	9.6839599609375	303.5854034423828	18

extensive (and unwanted) legal protection of animals. Hence, we cannot say	128.6999969482422	149.81512451171875	9.48004150390625	303.6254425048828	20

welfare.8 This does not mean that we should disregard the indirect elements,	128.70001220703125	274.4615478515625	11.31573486328125	303.621826171875	20
and nor does it mean that the conclusion I will draw is not valid for an indirect	128.7001953125	287.81463623046875	9.48004150390625	303.58935546875	20
approach. It means, rather, that the kinds of reasons we will consider, unless	128.7001953125	299.334716796875	9.48004150390625	303.6632995605469	20
otherwise specified, will regard the duties – if any exist – that we have directly	128.7001953125	310.79510498046875	9.48004150390625	303.5855712890625	20
towards animals, not the duties we have towards the attitudes and beliefs of	128.7001953125	322.315185546875	9.480010986328125	303.4424133300781	20
other human beings towards animals. After all, although legal systems and	128.7001953125	333.8352966308594	9.47998046875	303.59979248046875	20
cultural practices are not immune to inconsistencies and ambiguities, a direct	128.7001953125	345.295654296875	9.47998046875	303.57891845703125	20
approach towards animal welfare seems capable of capturing the widespread	128.70021057128906	356.81573486328125	9.47998046875	303.5401153564453	20
idea that causing unnecessary suffering to a sentient being is intrinsically	128.70021057128906	368.3358154296875	9.47998046875	303.56007385253906	20
wrong. This is why adopting a perspective based on direct duties seems a	128.70021057128906	379.7961730957031	9.47998046875	303.6158905029297	20
worthwhile enterprise. One may object that such a direct approach is too mini-	128.70021057128906	391.3162536621094	9.47998046875	303.54771423339844	20
mal if it can permit the killing of animals. That may be true. However, as I	128.70021057128906	402.8363342285156	9.47998046875	303.5902557373047	20
have said, here my aim is not to ask whether the principles underlying current	128.70021057128906	414.29669189453125	9.47998046875	303.65476989746094	20
legislation on animals are the most convincing. I simply start there in order to	128.70021057128906	425.8167724609375	9.47998046875	303.60826110839844	20
ask whether and how we may reconcile the duty to care for animals and the	128.70021057128906	437.33685302734375	9.47998046875	303.57518005371094	20
right to religious freedom that allows ritual slaughter.	128.70021057128906	448.7972106933594	9.47998046875	203.3630828857422	20
As a preliminary remark, we should bear in mind that ritual slaughter was	140.04019165039062	460.3172912597656	9.47998046875	292.3062438964844	20
originally intended to cause the quickest and least painful death to animals,	128.70021057128906	471.8373718261719	9.47998046875	303.6396026611328	20
according to Jewish and Muslim traditions (Lerner and Rabello 2006/7). Such a	128.70021057128906	483.2977294921875	9.47998046875	303.65098571777344	20
belief should not be discarded as mere self-deceit, because this might have	128.70021057128906	494.81781005859375	9.47998046875	303.57228088378906	20
been the case at the time of its origination, according to the scientific	128.70021057128906	506.337890625	9.47998046875	303.61399841308594	20
mals qua “fellow creatures” (Mitgeschöpf). And this seems to point at a direct concern for	137.22000122070312	530.994873046875	8.00390625	295.00543212890625	21
animals.	137.22079467773438	540.3186645507812	7.97998046875	25.943771362304688	21
8 I have provided an alternative account based on an indirect view on the protection of	128.6999969482422	547.914794921875	9.6839599609375	303.66127014160156	21
animals in Zuolo (2014). Although I think the indirect approach has the advantage of being	137.22015380859375	558.918701171875	7.97998046875	295.0645446777344	21
more clearly compatible with a number of admitted practices and with ritual slaughter in	137.22015380859375	568.2185668945312	7.97998046875	295.07891845703125	21
particular, in this paper I assume that the account underlying current laws may be justified	137.22015380859375	577.5184326171875	7.97998046875	294.9775085449219	21
as a set of direct duties. I cannot establish here which account is more convincing all things	137.2201385498047	586.818359375	7.9799957275390625	295.0214080810547	21

knowledge and the tools available. The religious grounds of the practice may	128.6999969482422	115.3145751953125	9.48004150390625	303.4699249267578	23

Hence, we may say that Jewish and Muslim religious traditions have also	140.03997802734375	149.81512451171875	9.48004150390625	292.21148681640625	23
been committed to the minimization of animal suffering, despite the fact that	128.6999969482422	161.335205078125	9.48004150390625	303.5703887939453	23
their understanding of this requirement is based upon religious rather than	128.6999969482422	172.79559326171875	9.48004150390625	303.7107391357422	23

ciple regarding animal welfare when it is applied to slaughter: one informed by	128.6999969482422	230.3363037109375	9.48004150390625	303.6149139404297	23
contemporary practices and science, and the other informed by traditional	128.6999969482422	241.79669189453125	9.48004150390625	303.6481475830078	23
religious techniques.9 This picture, which reinterprets a clash of values as a clash	128.6999969482422	251.4815673828125	11.31524658203125	303.7493133544922	23
of methods for reducing animal suffering, seems plausible. However, in the end,	128.6998291015625	264.83465576171875	9.48004150390625	303.6197204589844	23
the reason to consider the traditional practice of ritual slaughter so important is	128.6998291015625	276.2950439453125	9.48004150390625	303.6654052734375	23
that it seems to be at the core of Jewish and Muslim communities, touching upon	128.6998291015625	287.81512451171875	9.48004150390625	303.81011962890625	23
a fundamental part of these religions, namely eating10 in a way that is consistent	128.6998291015625	297.50152587890625	11.313720703125	303.6654357910156	23
with one’s most important beliefs. Hence, the clash of values resurfaces again.	128.6999969482422	310.794921875	9.48004150390625	303.75242614746094	23
This qualification is important in order to prevent a further objection. If Jews and	128.6999969482422	322.31500244140625	9.480010986328125	303.69541931152344	23
Muslims should in principle eat only kosher and halal meat, whose production	128.6999969482422	333.8351135253906	9.47998046875	303.67076110839844	23
seems to be at odds with other legal and moral requirements, why cannot we say	128.6999969482422	345.29547119140625	9.47998046875	303.7090301513672	23
that Jews and Muslims ought to forsake meat eating and become vegetarian?	128.6999969482422	356.8155517578125	9.47998046875	303.6537322998047	23
After all, this same choice is made by many people on moral grounds. If the	128.6999969482422	368.33563232421875	9.47998046875	303.7003631591797	23
reasons for forbidding non-halal and non-kosher meat are so important, why	128.6999969482422	379.7959899902344	9.47998046875	303.5771942138672	23
shouldn’t believers be willing and committed not to eating meat at all where it	128.6999969482422	391.3160705566406	9.47998046875	303.6859893798828	23
does not comply with their religious requirements? This is a serious question	128.6999969482422	402.8361511230469	9.47998046875	303.61976623535156	23
because we cannot take it for granted that any kind of practice that is typical of	128.6999969482422	414.2965087890625	9.47998046875	303.6918182373047	23

cial treatment. I shall leave discussion of this issue to the final section. Here it	128.6999969482422	437.336669921875	9.47998046875	303.64540100097656	23
suffices to say that, whatever our response to the question of whether ritual	128.6999969482422	448.7970275878906	9.47998046875	303.68507385253906	23
slaughter is fundamental to Jewish and Muslim traditions, we have another	128.6999969482422	460.3171081542969	9.47998046875	303.55418395996094	23
reason for taking the practice of religious slaughter seriously. This is the rea-	128.6999969482422	471.8371887207031	9.47998046875	303.6055450439453	23
sonable presumption that prohibiting halal and kosher meat would cause further	128.6999969482422	483.29754638671875	9.47998046875	303.68797302246094	23
disadvantage to Muslims and Jews – two communities that have already suf-	128.6999969482422	494.817626953125	9.47998046875	303.67564392089844	23
fered extensive discrimination. Hence, we might say that whatever our position	128.6999969482422	506.33770751953125	9.47998046875	303.6689910888672	23
9 This is at least partially shown by the fact that some Jewish and Muslim theorists claim that	128.6999969482422	538.6148681640625	9.683837890625	303.66050720214844	24
ritual killing is still the least painful way of slaughtering because, if the method is properly	137.21937561035156	549.6185913085938	7.97998046875	295.06846618652344	24
performed, the animal loses consciousness immediately. However, the factual validity of this	137.21939086914062	558.91845703125	7.97998046875	294.98468017578125	24
claim is at least doubtful and discussing it would lead us astray.	137.21939086914062	568.2183837890625	7.97998046875	202.98248291015625	24
10 I focus only on meat eating, thus leaving aside the problem of the use of leather because	128.6999969482422	575.81494140625	9.683837890625	303.6523895263672	24
Muslim and Jewish communities seem to have divergent prescriptions on this, and because	137.2200927734375	586.8186645507812	7.9799957275390625	295.1435241699219	24

What Does a Concern for Animal Welfare Require of Us?	157.20057678222656	160.5845947265625	12.47998046875	272.97499084472656	28

slaughter? If we are really concerned with animal welfare, while still admitting	128.6999969482422	197.8746337890625	9.48004150390625	303.60362243652344	29

derestimate the suffering involved in ritual slaughter. My point, rather, is to	128.6999969482422	232.37518310546875	9.48004150390625	303.6140594482422	29
argue that there seems to be a sort of hypocrisy or incoherent attitude regarding	128.6999969482422	243.8355712890625	9.48004150390625	303.56752014160156	29
animal suffering. If a concern for animal welfare requires the minimization of	128.6999969482422	255.35565185546875	9.48004150390625	303.57420349121094	29
suffering, why should this minimization of suffering specifically target the	128.6999969482422	266.875732421875	9.48004150390625	303.5409698486328	29
killing of animals, rather than being more extensively applied to the whole life	128.6999969482422	278.33612060546875	9.48004150390625	303.6367645263672	29

the alternative, namely providing better care during animals’ lives, would be too	128.6999969482422	312.836669921875	9.48004150390625	303.6764678955078	29
costly. Cost is certainly a problem, in that more extensive care for animals during	128.6999969482422	324.35675048828125	9.480010986328125	303.7353057861328	29
their lives is certainly more costly than simply being concerned about their suffer-	128.6999969482422	335.8768615722656	9.47998046875	303.76197814941406	29
ing at the very end of their lives. The former would require us to ban industrial	128.6999969482422	347.33721923828125	9.47998046875	303.6708221435547	29
farming, or at least to raise animals using different methods, leaving them with	128.6999969482422	358.8572998046875	9.47998046875	303.76853942871094	29
more space to move, more possibilities for interaction with other animals, more	128.6999969482422	370.37738037109375	9.47998046875	303.7298126220703	29
time to spend with their offspring, and so on. It seems clear that much more can	128.6999969482422	381.8377380371094	9.47998046875	303.63575744628906	29
be done to promote the welfare of farmed animals. A number of recent studies	128.6999969482422	393.3578186035156	9.47998046875	303.69175720214844	29
show that farmed animals suffer even when there is no direct evidence of this	128.6999969482422	404.8778991699219	9.47998046875	303.7191925048828	29
suffering (as there is during slaughter) (Aaltola 2012, 1-67). However, if we	128.6999969482422	416.3382568359375	9.47998046875	303.71067810058594	29

on the basis of cost, the normative grounding of our argument is both weak and	128.6999969482422	439.37841796875	9.47998046875	303.6556854248047	29
unclear. The only plausible way to defend the current focus on animal suffering	128.6999969482422	450.8387756347656	9.47998046875	303.6984100341797	29
during slaughter is to claim that suffering during slaughter is different from –	128.6999969482422	462.3588562011719	9.47998046875	303.7143096923828	29
and/or not reducible to – other types of suffering. Such a difference would justify	128.6999969482422	473.8789367675781	9.47998046875	303.5866241455078	29
giving priority to suffering during slaughter, rather than other forms of suffer-	128.6999969482422	485.33929443359375	9.47998046875	303.71925354003906	29
ing, and would ground the legal and moral obligation to stun animals. Let us	128.6999969482422	496.859375	9.47998046875	303.60450744628906	29
see what theories in animal ethics have to say about this issue.	128.6999969482422	508.37945556640625	9.47998046875	236.3894805908203	29
We could give priority to the suffering caused by slaughter either because	140.03997802734375	519.83984375	9.47998046875	292.221923828125	29
we consider it to be of greater magnitude or because we have independent	128.6999969482422	531.35986328125	9.47998046875	303.5514678955078	29
reasons to prevent this type of suffering. The former holds true only if we sub-	128.6999969482422	542.8800048828125	9.47998046875	303.5760040283203	29

than countless other minor types of suffering. If we look at this from a broadly	128.6999969482422	565.8604125976562	9.47998046875	303.62449645996094	29

moments of their lives. Even if we do not subscribe to a thoroughly utilitarian	128.6999969482422	115.3145751953125	9.48004150390625	303.59226989746094	31

sions: intensity and duration.11 We may think that the suffering caused by	128.6999969482422	159.50152587890625	11.313720703125	303.58558654785156	31
slaughter is far more intense than other kinds of suffering, but its duration is	128.69998168945312	172.794921875	9.48004150390625	303.59326171875	31
certainly shorter than others, which are typically repeated many times. Unless	128.69998168945312	184.31500244140625	9.48004150390625	303.6244812011719	31
we take intensity more seriously than duration, which we have no obvious	128.69998168945312	195.8350830078125	9.48004150390625	303.6339416503906	31

tion of the respective amount of suffering. Hence, the suffering involved in	128.69998168945312	218.8155517578125	9.48004150390625	303.61114501953125	31
slaughter should be weighted through these two dimensions in the same way as	128.69998168945312	230.33563232421875	9.48004150390625	303.6064453125	31
other types of suffering. And if so, it seems hard to justify the idea that the	128.69998168945312	241.7960205078125	9.48004150390625	303.6681213378906	31
suffering involved in slaughter has any kind of priority over that involved in	128.69998168945312	253.31610107421875	9.48004150390625	303.5286865234375	31

The alternative to placing more importance on the suffering caused by	140.0399627685547	276.29656982421875	9.48004150390625	292.2057647705078	31
slaughter is to see the types of activities involved in ritual slaughter (and in	128.69998168945312	287.816650390625	9.48004150390625	303.61212158203125	31
other types of slaughter without stunning) as wrong in themselves, irrespective	128.69998168945312	299.33673095703125	9.48004150390625	303.66424560546875	31
of whether the suffering involved during slaughter is quantitatively greater than	128.69998168945312	310.797119140625	9.48004150390625	303.60076904296875	31
that experienced in industrial farming. On this view, it is the very mode of	128.69998168945312	322.31719970703125	9.480010986328125	303.5505065917969	31
killing without stunning that gives us a reason to forbid such an action. This	128.69998168945312	333.8373107910156	9.47998046875	303.5599670410156	31
can be done either by adopting a virtue-based account or a Kantian view. First,	128.69998168945312	345.29766845703125	9.47998046875	303.6358337402344	31
on a virtue-based account, it is intrinsically wrong to kill an animal without stun-	128.69998168945312	356.8177490234375	9.47998046875	303.6624755859375	31
ning it insofar as this is a form of cruelty, which is per se intrinsically wrong. But	128.69998168945312	368.33782958984375	9.47998046875	303.614013671875	31
this claim seems to bear the burden of proof in showing why ritual slaughter is	128.69998168945312	379.7981872558594	9.47998046875	303.6698913574219	31
intrinsically wrong while standard slaughter is not. To prove that it is intrinsically	128.69998168945312	391.3182678222656	9.47998046875	303.6954040527344	31
wrong, we should consider only the intrinsic features of the act of killing irre-	128.69998168945312	402.8383483886719	9.47998046875	303.5817565917969	31
spective of the type of consequences it involves. To do this, we have to show that	128.69998168945312	414.2987060546875	9.47998046875	303.630126953125	31
ritual killing is necessarily motivated by a vicious intention and/or that it neces-	128.69998168945312	425.81878662109375	9.47998046875	303.5590515136719	31
sarily fosters vicious traits of character. But this seems particularly difficult to	128.69998168945312	437.3388671875	9.47998046875	303.7333984375	31
show if we consider, as seen above, that ritual slaughter was introduced in the	128.69998168945312	448.7992248535156	9.47998046875	303.6490783691406	31
beginning as a way of minimizing animal suffering. This means that the stand-	128.69998168945312	460.3193054199219	9.47998046875	303.6471862792969	31
ard religious motivation for ritual slaughter may not stem from a desire to be	128.69998168945312	471.8393859863281	9.47998046875	303.65667724609375	31
cruel but rather from a desire to minimize animal suffering. Hence, there seems	128.69998168945312	483.29974365234375	9.47998046875	303.6443176269531	31
to be no cruel motivation involved in, and a virtue-based account would have	128.69998168945312	494.81982421875	9.47998046875	303.5675354003906	31
no reason to reject the practice.	128.69998168945312	506.33990478515625	9.47998046875	118.66493225097656	31
The second way in which this perspective may be justified is the Kantian	140.0399627685547	517.80029296875	9.47998046875	292.2039337158203	31
view. As we know, according to Kant (1997), causing unnecessary pain to	128.69998168945312	529.3203125	9.47998046875	303.6661682128906	31
animals is wrong, not in virtue of their direct interest in not suffering, but be-	128.69998168945312	540.8404541015625	9.47998046875	303.5751647949219	31
cause cruel actions disrespect our humanity and are conducive to the develop-	128.69998168945312	552.30078125	9.47998046875	303.6357727050781	31
ment of a cruel attitude towards other human beings. To assess this alternative,	128.69998168945312	563.8208618164062	9.47998046875	303.54486083984375	31
11 As is well-known, the origin of this approach to measuring value (and disvalue) dates back	128.6999969482422	585.1148681640625	9.683914184570312	303.6954803466797	32

let us put aside the fact that we are considering only justifications for animal	128.6999969482422	115.3145751953125	9.48004150390625	303.56004333496094	34

development of wrongful and vicious attitudes seems at odds with the overall	128.6999969482422	138.2950439453125	9.48004150390625	303.5600128173828	34

First, the idea that (ritual) slaughtering is more conducive to developing vicious	128.6999969482422	161.335205078125	9.48004150390625	303.6548614501953	34
attitudes and behaviors is factually dubious. If this were the case, one might	128.6999969482422	172.79559326171875	9.48004150390625	303.6112518310547	34
also argue that people who perform slaughter according to the ritual method or	128.6999969482422	184.315673828125	9.48004150390625	303.6045379638672	34
witness such slaughter are more likely to be cruel towards other human beings.	128.6999969482422	195.83575439453125	9.48004150390625	303.48976135253906	34
But there does not seem to be any evidence supporting this claim. And the	128.6999969482422	207.296142578125	9.48004150390625	303.56568908691406	34
burden of proof is borne by those who make it. Moreover, besides the dubious	128.6999969482422	218.81622314453125	9.48004150390625	303.56089782714844	34
factual reliability of this statement, it also has an unpalatable moral implication.	128.6999969482422	230.3363037109375	9.48004150390625	303.7686309814453	34
Indeed, it would amount to saying that in Jewish and Muslim communities	128.6999969482422	241.79669189453125	9.48004150390625	303.55616760253906	34

A further possibility is to take a relational approach. Under the umbrella of	140.03982543945312	356.8146667480469	9.47998046875	292.1925048828125	34
“relational approaches” I include diverse theories: feminist care-based ap-	128.69984436035156	368.3347473144531	9.47998046875	303.64442443847656	34

2014), and pluralist positions (Anderson 2004; Scruton 2000). Needless to say	128.69984436035156	391.315185546875	9.47998046875	303.6168670654297	34
this is a very sketchy categorization. These theories differ in many relevant	128.69984436035156	402.83526611328125	9.47998046875	303.65953063964844	34

These approaches do not provide a univocal normative response to our prob-	140.03982543945312	494.8167419433594	9.47998046875	292.19818115234375	34
lem. Some do not accept the killing of animals at all. Others hold that it is not	128.69984436035156	506.3367919921875	9.47998046875	303.69078063964844	34
in principle wrong to kill animals provided that it is done in the proper way.13	128.69984436035156	515.9615478515625	11.31561279296875	303.6001434326172	34
However, it would seem odd to include among admissible methods, that is,	128.70016479492188	529.314697265625	9.47998046875	303.6536865234375	34
12 Perhaps it is not in principle impossible to outline a rights-based approach that does not	128.6999969482422	557.21484375	9.6839599609375	303.65086364746094	35
necessarily include a right to life. However, this possibility is not considered by current pro-	137.22010803222656	568.2186889648438	7.97998046875	295.07325744628906	35

among those that are more respectful of animal nature and the expression of	128.6999969482422	115.3145751953125	9.48004150390625	303.6453399658203	37
care towards them, those that involve more suffering. Moreover, caring more	128.6999969482422	126.83465576171875	9.48004150390625	303.69850158691406	37
for an animal’s death than for an animal’s life would be utterly inconsistent	128.6999969482422	138.2950439453125	9.48004150390625	303.71360778808594	37
with the ideas grounding care-based theories.	128.6999969482422	149.81512451171875	9.48004150390625	172.0989532470703	37
Hence, upon reviewing consequentialist, virtue-based, Kantian, rights-based,	140.03997802734375	161.335205078125	9.48004150390625	292.26934814453125	37
and care-based views, there seems to be no defensible argument for giving	128.6999969482422	172.79559326171875	9.48004150390625	303.54298400878906	37
priority to the suffering involved in slaughter rather than in the life of a raised	128.6999969482422	184.315673828125	9.48004150390625	303.62351989746094	37
animal. The only remaining view that could justify giving priority to the suffer-	128.6999969482422	195.83575439453125	9.48004150390625	303.5922088623047	37
ing involved in slaughter would have to prioritize the final condition of an	128.6999969482422	207.296142578125	9.48004150390625	303.53822326660156	37
individual’s life, giving it a special if not fundamental significance, perhaps	128.6999969482422	218.81622314453125	9.48004150390625	303.64158630371094	37
because the very final moments in an individual life constitute the truth of	128.6999969482422	230.3363037109375	9.48004150390625	303.57518005371094	37
one’s life. However, this view is deeply suspicious because it seems to depend	128.6999969482422	241.79669189453125	9.48004150390625	303.68324279785156	37
on religious and theological presuppositions that are controversial in them-	128.6999969482422	253.3167724609375	9.48004150390625	303.5410614013672	37
selves, and even more dubious when applied to animals. It seems more plausi-	128.6999969482422	264.83685302734375	9.48004150390625	303.6840362548828	37
ble, in sum, to suppose that if we are concerned with the suffering of animals,	128.6999969482422	276.2972412109375	9.48004150390625	303.50025939941406	37
we ought to estimate their suffering based on magnitude and frequency through	128.6999969482422	287.81732177734375	9.48004150390625	303.6453399658203	37
the whole of a life, without giving priority to its end. After all, giving priority	128.6999969482422	299.33740234375	9.48004150390625	303.6007537841797	37
to the moment of death seems unwarranted and even based upon an anthropo-	128.6999969482422	310.79779052734375	9.48004150390625	303.6083526611328	37
centric bias. Accordingly, if we were to calculate the pains and sufferings in the	128.6999969482422	322.31787109375	9.480010986328125	303.78468322753906	37

dustrial farm, it would almost certainly turn out that the suffering and pain	128.6999969482422	345.29833984375	9.47998046875	303.5315704345703	37
induced would outweigh the pain and suffering caused by ritual slaughter.	128.6999969482422	356.81842041015625	9.47998046875	281.5237579345703	37

Building on this, I want to argue that there is a flaw both in legislation prohibit-	128.6999969482422	416.3345947265625	9.47998046875	303.57984924316406	40
ing ritual slaughter and in that allowing it. First, prohibiting ritual slaughter	128.6999969482422	427.85467529296875	9.47998046875	303.55714416503906	40
does not seem fully justified because, as seen, there is nothing special about the	128.6999969482422	439.374755859375	9.47998046875	303.64723205566406	40
pain inflicted during death in relation to the pain experienced by an animal	128.6999969482422	450.8351135253906	9.47998046875	303.5551300048828	40
during its life. Second, allowing ritual slaughter might discriminate against	128.6999969482422	462.3551940917969	9.47998046875	303.74488830566406	40
ritually slaughtered animals. This is so because both ritually slaughtered and	128.6999969482422	473.8752746582031	9.47998046875	303.56761169433594	40
non-ritually slaughtered animals are raised in the same conditions (typically on	128.6999969482422	485.33563232421875	9.47998046875	303.6044464111328	40
industrial farms), but the former experience the pain of ritual slaughter. While,	128.6999969482422	496.855712890625	9.47998046875	303.6785125732422	40
as seen, there is nothing special about this pain, the amount of suffering in-	128.6999969482422	508.37579345703125	9.47998046875	303.6320037841797	40
volved tilts the balance of suffering in a way that is, quantitatively, unfair to	128.6999969482422	519.836181640625	9.47998046875	303.67185974121094	40
ritually slaughtered animals. Indeed, it seems fair to say that, whatever the	128.6999969482422	531.356201171875	9.47998046875	303.6594696044922	40
assessment of death to which one subscribes, ritually slaughtered animals suf-	128.6999969482422	542.8763427734375	9.47998046875	303.6300811767578	40
fer more than non-ritually slaughtered animals. Hence, we seem to discriminate	128.6999969482422	554.336669921875	9.47998046875	303.64808654785156	40
against ritually slaughtered animals. And, if we ought to be concerned with the	128.6999969482422	565.8567504882812	9.47998046875	303.6538543701172	40
suffering of animals because suffering is intrinsically wrong, and in virtue of	128.6999969482422	577.3768310546875	9.479995727539062	303.59791564941406	40

anism in certain respects. And, as we have seen, utilitarianism is not committed to	128.7001495361328	241.79559326171875	9.48004150390625	303.81871032714844	42

proper form of egalitarianism for animals.	128.70037841796875	345.2950439453125	9.47998046875	155.75933837890625	42
While these objections are interesting, I submit that there are reasons for	140.0403594970703	356.81512451171875	9.47998046875	292.18775939941406	42
taking the non-discrimination of animals seriously even from the welfarist	128.70037841796875	368.335205078125	9.47998046875	303.5287170410156	42
perspective discussed here. This can be proved without making reference to the	128.70037841796875	379.7955627441406	9.47998046875	303.5636901855469	42
egalitarian principles embraced by some rights-based theories. The advantage	128.70037841796875	391.3156433105469	9.47998046875	303.5808410644531	42
of this strategy is that the resulting argument will be more acceptable from a	128.7003631591797	402.8357238769531	9.47998046875	303.6282501220703	42

tarianism. To prove this, I will proceed, first, by advancing a positive argument in	128.7003631591797	425.816162109375	9.47998046875	303.66419982910156	42
favor of my proposal and, second, by calling the tenability of the alternative view	128.70034790039062	437.33624267578125	9.47998046875	303.7278137207031	42
into question. In other words, I will first sketch the idea that a direct-duty per-	128.70034790039062	448.7966003417969	9.47998046875	303.69073486328125	42
spective implicitly commits us to the principle of non-discrimination. Second, I	128.70034790039062	460.3166809082031	9.47998046875	303.7667541503906	42
will argue that the alternative, namely of discriminating between ritually and non-	128.70034790039062	471.8367614746094	9.47998046875	303.7239990234375	42
ritually slaughtered animals, has a bigger burden of proof and that the reasons	128.70034790039062	483.297119140625	9.47998046875	303.6396484375	42
available to ground such a discrimination are unconvincing.	128.70034790039062	494.81719970703125	9.47998046875	227.53329467773438	42
14 I am grateful to Peter Niesen and Svenja Ahlhaus for pressing me to respond to this question.	128.6999969482422	520.0147705078125	9.68389892578125	297.08229064941406	43
15 For the former category, see Regan (1983) and Francione (2008), for the latter, see Singer	128.6999969482422	529.31494140625	9.683837890625	303.63880920410156	43

16 If so, however, it is not clear how such a non-egalitarian act utilitarianism could justify the	128.6999969482422	547.914794921875	9.6839599609375	303.56861877441406	43
discriminatory treatment of ritually slaughtered animals with respect to non-ritually	137.2200927734375	558.918701171875	7.97998046875	295.1211242675781	43
slaughtered ones. Certainly, this measure is more beneficial to the non-ritually slaughtered	137.22007751464844	568.2185668945312	7.97998046875	295.08518981933594	43
animals, but it would be preferable to benefit both categories provided that such equal	137.2200927734375	577.5184326171875	7.97998046875	295.0660705566406	43
treatment is not disadvantageous in other respects. In sum, this discrimination is sub-	137.22007751464844	586.818359375	7.9799957275390625	295.0277862548828	43

We should recall that here I am discussing views endorsing a direct obliga-	140.0399932861328	115.3145751953125	9.48004150390625	292.2399139404297	45
tion toward animal welfare. There are diverse ways to ground an obligation	128.70001220703125	126.83465576171875	9.48004150390625	303.5931701660156	45
towards animal welfare. Whatever we think regarding the alleged animal right	128.70001220703125	138.2950439453125	9.48004150390625	303.6443176269531	45
to life, respect for animal welfare might be grounded in the idea that we ought	128.70001220703125	149.81512451171875	9.48004150390625	303.63873291015625	45
to respect animals’ sentience and natural dispositions. This holds true in gen-	128.70001220703125	161.335205078125	9.48004150390625	303.6471862792969	45

not defend any of these views. Instead, I am interested in understanding the	128.70001220703125	195.83575439453125	9.48004150390625	303.62066650390625	45
implications of a direct approach towards animal welfare for the issue of ritual	128.70001220703125	207.296142578125	9.48004150390625	303.5845947265625	45
slaughter. I simply assume that any of these views could reasonably be defend-	128.70001220703125	218.81622314453125	9.48004150390625	303.6784973144531	45
ed. What all of these views, and others, have in common is the idea that if we	128.70001220703125	230.3363037109375	9.48004150390625	303.6661376953125	45
owe a direct duty to an individual, that individual is supposed to have a feature	128.70001220703125	241.79669189453125	9.48004150390625	303.5855712890625	45
justifying our direct duties. In other words, the individual is recognized as	128.70001220703125	253.3167724609375	9.48004150390625	303.6092224121094	45
having an autonomous interest in not being harmed or in being benefited. This	128.70001220703125	264.83685302734375	9.48004150390625	303.6605529785156	45
obviously puts direct views in opposition to indirect views, according to which	128.70001220703125	276.2972412109375	9.48004150390625	303.5533447265625	45
– for instance, in the Kantian version – we ought not to cause unnecessary	128.70001220703125	287.81732177734375	9.48004150390625	303.665283203125	45

This is to say that whatever theory we adopt in support of direct duties to ani-	128.70001220703125	310.79779052734375	9.48004150390625	303.58935546875	45
mals, by adopting a direct view we implicitly assume that the individuals to	128.70001220703125	322.31787109375	9.480010986328125	303.5514221191406	45
whom we owe such duties have subjective interests that merit consideration in	128.70001220703125	333.8379821777344	9.47998046875	303.664306640625	45
their own right and not (only) in virtue of other kinds of considerations, wheth-	128.70001220703125	345.29833984375	9.47998046875	303.63397216796875	45
er indirect or instrumental. In virtue of this feature of owing something to a	128.70001220703125	356.81842041015625	9.47998046875	303.5827331542969	45
being that subjectively merits such a duty, it would be strange to assume that	128.70001220703125	368.3385009765625	9.47998046875	303.49456787109375	45
other typical general meta-normative principles do not apply. If we assume, as	128.70001220703125	379.7988586425781	9.47998046875	303.62530517578125	45
we do here, that we have direct duties towards animals and a responsibility to	128.70001220703125	391.3189392089844	9.47998046875	303.6566162109375	45
maintain animal welfare, it would seem odd if we did not apply the principle of	128.70001220703125	402.8390197753906	9.47998046875	303.6082763671875	45
non-discrimination toward the beings meriting our direct duties. The opposite	128.70001220703125	414.29937744140625	9.47998046875	303.5988464355469	45
claim would certainly bear a bigger burden of proof. The burden is to explain	128.70001220703125	425.8194580078125	9.47998046875	303.5448303222656	45
why we should treat some categories of animals differently.	128.70001220703125	437.33953857421875	9.47998046875	227.24411010742188	45
To justify such a discrimination, it is worth remarking that in direct views a	140.0399932861328	448.7998962402344	9.47998046875	292.2550811767578	45
being is entitled to certain treatment in virtue of its intrinsic features, not in	128.70001220703125	460.3199768066406	9.47998046875	303.6623840332031	45
virtue of the dispositions regarding animals that the person who is under that	128.70001220703125	471.8400573730469	9.47998046875	303.5135803222656	45
duty possesses. As such, we must ask what distinguishes ritually slaughtered	128.70001220703125	483.3004150390625	9.47998046875	303.6548767089844	45
animals from non-ritually slaughtered animals, and whether such a difference is	128.70001220703125	494.82049560546875	9.47998046875	303.6718444824219	45
sufficient to justify this discrimination. The only reason for this discrimination	128.70001220703125	506.340576171875	9.47998046875	303.60931396484375	45
is that animals are slaughtered ritually to respect the religious identity of Mus-	128.70001220703125	517.8009033203125	9.47998046875	303.5591125488281	45
lims and Jews. However, there are two considerations that weaken this point in	128.70001220703125	529.321044921875	9.47998046875	303.7116394042969	45
normative terms. First, we may say that what distinguishes ritually slaughtered	128.70001220703125	540.841064453125	9.47998046875	303.66619873046875	45
animals from non-ritually slaughtered animals is not an intrinsic feature of	128.70001220703125	552.3014526367188	9.47998046875	303.6367492675781	45
those animals, because they are ritually slaughtered only in virtue of the inde-	128.70001220703125	563.821533203125	9.47998046875	303.59130859375	45
pendent choice of a human being. There is no intrinsic and specific feature of	128.70001220703125	575.3416137695312	9.47998046875	303.4992980957031	45
animals that individually or collectively determines the fact that they merit	128.70001220703125	586.802001953125	9.480010986328125	303.6964416503906	45
such slaughter and that might provide a reason for grounding this discrimina-	128.70001220703125	598.3220825195312	9.479995727539062	303.6054382324219	45

tion. Second, the normative reason for this discrimination is respect for the	128.6999969482422	115.3145751953125	9.48004150390625	303.64720153808594	47

nate, but by no means necessary, consequence of the fact that there are different	128.6999969482422	172.79559326171875	9.48004150390625	303.7477569580078	47
religious doctrines and techniques for slaughtering animals. This means that the	128.6999969482422	184.315673828125	9.48004150390625	303.67176818847656	47
religious difference is not a reason to discriminate against a category of animals	128.6999969482422	195.83575439453125	9.48004150390625	303.78282165527344	47
when there are alternatives available (and we will see in the next section what	128.6999969482422	207.296142578125	9.48004150390625	303.59132385253906	47
the alternative is), because Jewish and Muslim practices do not demand that	128.6999969482422	218.81622314453125	9.48004150390625	303.53623962402344	47

Now we can respond to the non-egalitarian utilitarian objection raised	140.04022216796875	276.294921875	9.48004150390625	292.30157470703125	47
above. Although it is true that the welfarist approach I propose here would not	128.7002410888672	287.81500244140625	9.48004150390625	303.63682556152344	47
be vindicated by this form of utilitarianism, it is not clear in our case how such a	128.7002410888672	299.3350830078125	9.48004150390625	303.74684143066406	47

be preferable to benefit both categories provided that the equal treatment is not	128.70025634765625	345.2960205078125	9.47998046875	303.60546875	47
disadvantageous in other respects. And the only way to argue against this non-	128.70025634765625	356.81610107421875	9.47998046875	303.6529235839844	47
discrimination would be to point at the major costs incurred in granting better	128.70025634765625	368.336181640625	9.47998046875	303.67474365234375	47
treatment to ritually slaughtered animals. Although this is certainly a serious	128.70025634765625	379.7965393066406	9.47998046875	303.7108154296875	47
argument, it is doubtful that even from this perspective the mere matter of costs	128.70025634765625	391.3166198730469	9.47998046875	303.5845642089844	47
would outweigh the interests of ritually slaughtered animals in suffering less.	128.70025634765625	402.8367004394531	9.47998046875	293.1111145019531	47
Hence, in virtue of the implicit commitment to non-discrimination of the di-	140.0402374267578	414.29705810546875	9.47998046875	292.2646026611328	47
rect view and the lack of justification for discrimination, there seems no reason	128.70025634765625	425.817138671875	9.47998046875	303.6946105957031	47
not to uphold the principle of non-discrimination when it comes to animals, at	128.70025634765625	437.33721923828125	9.47998046875	303.59698486328125	47
least with respect to their overall welfare and suffering.	128.70025634765625	448.7975769042969	9.47998046875	210.34222412109375	47

To remedy the discrimination suffered by ritually slaughtered animals, one may	128.6999969482422	522.8945922851562	9.47998046875	303.75904846191406	50
argue that we ought to abandon ritual slaughter altogether. This is one plausible	128.6999969482422	534.4146728515625	9.47998046875	303.61875915527344	50
solution. But the more radical solution of banning the raising and killing of	128.6999969482422	545.875	9.47998046875	303.6415252685547	50
17 The same holds true at the legal level. In other words, even if the argument I propose here	128.6999969482422	575.81494140625	9.683837890625	303.57496643066406	51
was not a morally conclusive argument, it would be strange in a legal sense to treat ritually-	137.22007751464844	586.8186645507812	7.9799957275390625	295.09080505371094	51
and non-ritually slaughtered animals differently.	137.2200927734375	596.1784057617188	7.9799957275390625	155.3482666015625	51

animals seems to result from the same premises. However, if we want to make	128.6999969482422	115.3145751953125	9.48004150390625	303.67005920410156	53

If we are concerned with animal welfare, but consider the killing of animals	140.03997802734375	161.335205078125	9.48004150390625	292.32904052734375	53
acceptable, and if we want to respect the right to religious freedom, but are	128.6999969482422	172.79559326171875	9.48004150390625	303.6140899658203	53
worried about discriminating between ritually slaughtered and non-ritually	128.6999969482422	184.315673828125	9.48004150390625	303.62351989746094	53

mal are given equal prospects of sufficiently high well-being in terms of the	128.6999969482422	207.296142578125	9.48004150390625	303.6567840576172	53
amount of pain suffered throughout their whole lives. This means that we either	128.6999969482422	218.81622314453125	9.48004150390625	303.63941955566406	53
forbid ritual slaughter – but hold independent reasons for admitting it –, or we	128.6999969482422	230.3363037109375	9.48004150390625	303.6652069091797	53
demand that ritually slaughtered animals be treated better during their lives than	128.6999969482422	241.79669189453125	9.48004150390625	303.7600860595703	53
those that are not ritually slaughtered, so as to compensate for the pain they suffer	128.6999969482422	253.3167724609375	9.48004150390625	303.5949249267578	53
at the point of death. How this compensation should be realized depends on some	128.6999969482422	264.83685302734375	9.48004150390625	303.6366424560547	53
technical issues and on the relative costs, which I cannot discuss here. Moreover,	128.6999969482422	276.2972412109375	9.48004150390625	303.6244659423828	53
it depends on an estimation of an animal’s prospects of suffering, which seem	128.6999969482422	287.81732177734375	9.48004150390625	303.65855407714844	53
very difficult to calculate individually and comparatively.18 Despite problems	128.6999969482422	297.50152587890625	11.31591796875	303.57945251464844	53
with putting this idea into practice, doing so would certainly be feasible with	128.6995849609375	310.794921875	9.48004150390625	303.6045227050781	53
relatively minor changes to current methods of animal farming. To give an ex-	128.6995849609375	322.31500244140625	9.480010986328125	303.7077941894531	53
ample and a thumbnail criterion, it might be that ritually slaughtered animals	128.6995849609375	333.8351135253906	9.47998046875	303.6860046386719	53

Needless to say, the justification of this proposal depends on the supposition	140.03955078125	356.8155517578125	9.47998046875	292.1744689941406	53
that ritual slaughter is a necessary component of religious freedom and that we	128.69956970214844	368.33563232421875	9.47998046875	303.5856170654297	53
cannot simply tell Muslims and Jews not to eat meat. In other words, this solu-	128.69956970214844	379.7959899902344	9.47998046875	303.5807647705078	53
tion is acceptable only if ritual slaughter is necessary for the religious identity	128.69956970214844	391.3160705566406	9.47998046875	303.5865020751953	53

gious identities. If this condition does not obtain, we may simply require Mus-	128.69956970214844	414.2965087890625	9.47998046875	303.5428924560547	53

To meet this condition, it must be shown that religious identity and the in-	140.03955078125	437.336669921875	9.47998046875	292.253173828125	53

claim has to be justified, because religiously informed practices, as well as	128.69956970214844	460.3171081542969	9.47998046875	303.56187438964844	53

that Muslim and Jewish communities bear at least a minimal burden of proof to	128.69956970214844	529.318115234375	9.47998046875	303.71827697753906	53
demonstrate this, in virtue of the fact that some Muslim communities seem to	128.69956970214844	540.8382568359375	9.47998046875	303.52491760253906	53

anti-cruelty legislation is desirable. Such laws are not based on sectarian views,	140.0399627685547	306.9625244140625	9.0	283.86268615722656	56

would be at least displaced, if not rebutted, if ritually slaughtered animals were	128.6999969482422	397.79547119140625	9.47998046875	303.63206481933594	57
treated better than non-ritually slaughtered animals, thus being compensated for	128.6999969482422	409.3155517578125	9.47998046875	303.80174255371094	57
the extra suffering involved during their slaughter. In this way, a standard cri-	128.6999969482422	420.83563232421875	9.47998046875	303.56468200683594	57

ment would be neutralized. Indeed, one of the most troubling objections to	128.6999969482422	443.8160705566406	9.47998046875	303.65855407714844	57
culturally-based differential treatment is that the beneficiaries of an exemption	128.6999969482422	455.3361511230469	9.47998046875	303.63209533691406	57
or a special treatment seem to be advantaged with respect to those who are	128.6999969482422	466.7965087890625	9.47998046875	303.69459533691406	57
compelled to abide by standard legal requirements.20 But, if animals suffering	128.6999969482422	476.4815368652344	11.315032958984375	303.63636779785156	57
more during slaughter are compensated, and no overall deviation from the	128.69956970214844	489.8346862792969	9.47998046875	303.5724334716797	57
general concern for animal suffering is involved, the idea that ritual slaughter	128.69956970214844	501.2950439453125	9.47998046875	303.61305236816406	57
entails a special treatment disappears. Thus, if ritually slaughtered animals are	128.69956970214844	512.7884521484375	9.50665283203125	303.5334014892578	57

treatment is outlined by Barry (2001). For a defense of a qualified and conditional account	137.22007751464844	577.5185546875	7.97998046875	295.12196350097656	58

To conclude, it is worth emphasizing that in this paper I have not defended	128.6999969482422	197.87445068359375	9.48004150390625	303.63111877441406	63
ritual slaughter in general. Its justification is deeply conditional on its necessity	128.6999969482422	209.3348388671875	9.48004150390625	303.5988311767578	63

freedom. My aim in this paper, rather, was to show that it is possible to recon-	128.6999969482422	232.375	9.48004150390625	303.5504913330078	63

sion by compensating the pain caused to ritually slaughtered animals with	128.6999969482422	255.35546875	9.48004150390625	303.67478942871094	63
better conditions during their lives. The advantage of this solution is that it	128.6999969482422	266.87554931640625	9.48004150390625	303.6055145263672	63
employs a principle of fairness towards animals as well as towards human	128.6999969482422	278.3359375	9.48004150390625	303.47560119628906	63
beings. It applies a principle of fairness to animals themselves because it com-	128.6999969482422	289.85601806640625	9.48004150390625	303.38938903808594	63
pensates the discrimination imposed by ritual slaughter. And it is also fair with	128.6999969482422	301.3760986328125	9.48004150390625	303.6244659423828	63
respect to human beings because it does not simply concede an exemption from	128.6999969482422	312.83648681640625	9.48004150390625	303.58177185058594	63
a general principle to two religious communities, but it also demands that they	128.6999969482422	324.3565673828125	9.480010986328125	303.65187072753906	63
treat the ritually slaughtered animals better, without asking them to change	128.6999969482422	335.8766784667969	9.47998046875	303.56556701660156	63
their religious practice. Hence, such a solution seems to address the problems	128.6999969482422	347.3370361328125	9.47998046875	303.64231872558594	63

minority claims in an environment of pluralistic values. This solution may	128.6999969482422	370.377197265625	9.47998046875	303.6538543701172	63
seem too biased, to some people, towards the status quo regarding the overall	128.6999969482422	381.8375549316406	9.47998046875	303.6785125732422	63
treatment of animals, but it has the advantage of proposing a very feasible	128.6999969482422	393.3576354980469	9.47998046875	303.59889221191406	63
