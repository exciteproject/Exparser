This consistency of political attitudes towards Europe has been particularly strong	128.6999969482422	375.3583068847656	9.47998046875	303.96385192871094	8

support to the EU amongst the population. Previous works have suggested that	128.6999969482422	432.8392639160156	9.47998046875	303.74864196777344	8
this did not occur with the national political elite in the beginning of the crisis	128.6999969482422	444.3593444824219	9.47998046875	303.71644592285156	8

The context changed dramatically during Zapatero’s second term (2008-	140.040283203125	391.3171691894531	9.47998046875	292.23236083984375	16

Finally, the PP government accepted a bailout deal from the EU to the banking	128.70037841796875	379.77044677734375	9.506622314453125	303.62921142578125	19

Thus, public debt evolved from 69,5% (2011) to 99,3% of the GDP (2014),	128.70037841796875	437.3377685546875	9.47998046875	303.5192565917969	19

duce it to -5.9% (2014). In turn, unemployment peaked in 2013 to almost five	128.70037841796875	460.3182067871094	9.47998046875	303.6302185058594	19

Yet this does not mean the disappearance of ideological and party differences.	128.6999969482422	239.9615478515625	11.315185546875	303.59999084472656	29
In fact, some studies (Ruiz Jiménez and Egea de Haro 2011; Vázquez et al.	128.70016479492188	253.31463623046875	9.48004150390625	303.4860534667969	29

instance, the PSOE has traditionally shown a more federalist stance, while the	128.70016479492188	276.29510498046875	9.48004150390625	303.55908203125	29

interests. Hence, a second theoretical expectation is stable interparty divisions	128.70016479492188	299.33526611328125	9.48004150390625	303.5619812011719	29

Regarding the Europeanization of core sovereign policies (foreign policy,	128.6999969482422	423.4161376953125	9.47998046875	234.37303161621094	248

on EU decision making still persists. This is in line with the perception of	128.69998168945312	488.39886474609375	9.47998046875	303.59600830078125	292

The pro-EU positions among Spanish MPs is also evidenced when looking	128.6999969482422	522.8994140625	9.47998046875	119.70396423339844	292

played by Spanish parliamentary elites. As we have explained in previous	241.97999572753906	627.35302734375	8.135208129882812	76.95033264160156	293

called the dilemma between responsibility and responsiveness (2013, 140).	128.6999969482422	241.79669189453125	9.48004150390625	303.7012481689453	294
According to this, the emphasis on responsibility by traditional parties to the	128.6999969482422	253.3167724609375	9.48004150390625	303.6425018310547	294

parties' emphasis on responsibility may have eroded the popular basis of the	128.6999969482422	333.8379821777344	9.47998046875	303.5619354248047	294
