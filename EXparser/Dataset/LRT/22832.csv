In a series of three studies, we investigated the validity of implicit theories that the German	49.79999923706055	407.70843505859375	8.0	315.3599433898926	7
public holds regarding Muslims. German participants expected Muslims to be more aggressive	49.79999923706055	417.70843505859375	8.0	327.9999885559082	7
than Christians, and therefore be more supportive of terrorism than Christians. Furthermore,	49.79999923706055	427.70843505859375	7.9999847412109375	325.5999946594238	7
Muslims were assumed to be more intrinsically religious and to hold a stronger identity with	49.79999923706055	437.70843505859375	8.0	319.1999397277832	7
their religion than Christians (Study 1). However, self-assessment surveys of Muslims and	49.79999923706055	447.70843505859375	8.0	307.5280342102051	7

Muslims were not more aggressive, more intrinsically religious, or more supportive of terrorism	49.79999923706055	467.70843505859375	8.0	330.8800849914551	7

(Study 2). Correspondingly, threat to religious identity was found to affect only Muslims’, but	49.80000305175781	487.70843505859375	8.0	323.2480010986328	7

(Jackson & Hunsberger, 1999), it seems possible	246.94479370117188	433.6299743652344	9.0	185.32168579101562	77
