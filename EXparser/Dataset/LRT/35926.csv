A Study of Works Councils in the Textile Industry**	56.69999694824219	130.31121826171875	20.95465087890625	398.64002990722656	3
This study has two aims: firstly to examine the general pattern of works	85.08000183105469	178.48663330078125	13.98004150390625	401.07508850097656	4
councillor attitudes towards management in the East German textile industry;	56.70060348510742	194.62652587890625	13.98004150390625	437.3964424133301	4
secondly to investigate the effectiveness of these works councils in representing	56.700592041015625	210.76641845703125	13.98004150390625	444.4786682128906	4
workers' interests. A survey of works councillors in over fifty mostly privatised textile	56.70060729980469	226.90631103515625	13.98004150390625	477.37086486816406	4
firms provided some initial indication that they have a cautious, co-operative attitude	56.700592041015625	243.04620361328125	13.98004150390625	479.0624084472656	4
towards management and are surely not „extended arms of management“ as has	56.700592041015625	259.18609619140625	13.98004150390625	471.7565002441406	4
been often declared in the literature. Moreover, a survey of the unionised workers in	56.700592041015625	275.32598876953125	13.98004150390625	473.6381530761719	4
these firms revealed an overwhelming acceptance of their works councils and a	56.700592041015625	291.46588134765625	13.98004150390625	445.65582275390625	4
conviction that the limited effectiveness of these institutions is mainly caused by the	56.700592041015625	307.60577392578125	13.98004150390625	467.0227966308594	4

are perhaps two deficiencies. The first is at the methodological level. The published	56.7003173828125	220.22772216796875	13.97998046875	482.10028076171875	14
research is almost entirely based on expert interviews and/or case studies of specific	56.70033264160156	236.5479736328125	13.97998046875	482.2106170654297	14
companies. More representative, quantitative studies have yet to be undertaken. The	56.700347900390625	252.86822509765625	13.97998046875	482.1463928222656	14
second deficiency is on a contextual level. Although it has been frequently argued that	56.700347900390625	269.1884765625	13.97998046875	482.1966857910156	14
employees are crucial actors at workplace level, there are still no broadly-based,	56.70033264160156	285.50872802734375	13.97998046875	482.09605407714844	14

This paper addresses these deficiencies in a study of workplace relations in the	85.07975769042969	321.14935302734375	13.980010986328125	453.5321807861328	14
East German textile industry. Two main issues are discussed. Firstly, it examines the	56.698974609375	337.4696044921875	13.980010986328125	481.9296875	14

Secondly and perhaps more importantly, it investigates the extent to which works	56.69903564453125	370.110107421875	13.980010986328125	481.9688720703125	14
councils are effective in representing workers interests. This will be discussed by	56.69903564453125	386.39105224609375	14.019317626953125	482.00384521484375	14

The paper starts by reviewing the relevant literature on workplace relations in East	56.69761657714844	419.07086181640625	13.980010986328125	481.9521026611328	14

Research on East German workplace relations commonly distinguishes between	85.07843017578125	505.4714660644531	13.980010986328125	453.62860107421875	17
the period before and the period after privatisation of the East German enterprises,2	56.69903564453125	519.1224365234375	16.649322509765625	481.9808349609375	17
since privatisation is seen as having a radical impact on workplace relations (e.g.	56.6998291015625	538.106201171875	13.980010986328125	481.97308349609375	17
Dathe and Schreiber 1993: 6; Ermischer and Preusche 1992; Hürtgen 1992). With	56.69984436035156	554.426513671875	13.980010986328125	481.9171600341797	17
regard to the first period, one may distinguish two views. The first argues that the	56.6998291015625	570.7467041015625	13.980010986328125	481.95068359375	17

operative, whilst the second argues that it was one in which the works council was	56.6998291015625	603.38720703125	13.979995727539062	481.9744873046875	17

each other, and with no extreme social status differences between management and	56.69921875	174.267578125	13.97998046875	482.02197265625	23
workers) is said to enhance co-operation.	56.69920349121094	190.58782958984375	13.97998046875	229.94996643066406	23
Secondly, there is said to have been a particular inter-dependence between	85.07859802246094	209.908203125	13.97998046875	453.57691955566406	23
management and works councils: both parties had an equal status in the beginning,	56.69923400878906	226.22845458984375	13.97998046875	481.96055603027344	23
even that management was sometimes in a weaker situation since it had to earn/	56.699249267578125	242.5487060546875	13.97998046875	482.0275573730469	23
regain legitimacy from the workforce (i.e. unclarified power relations, i.e. „power	56.699249267578125	258.86895751953125	13.97998046875	481.9702453613281	23
vacuum“ [Machtvakuum]) (e.g. Kirschner 1992: 85). Consequently, it is claimed that	56.699249267578125	275.189208984375	13.97998046875	481.9716491699219	23
management was dependent on the works council to get the support of the workforce	56.699249267578125	291.50946044921875	13.97998046875	481.8934020996094	23
for any restructuring. Moreover, both parties faced radical challenges from the	56.699249267578125	307.8297119140625	13.97998046875	481.9535217285156	23
internal and external environments. It is argued that this worked as a force for co-	56.699249267578125	324.14996337890625	13.980010986328125	481.9129333496094	23
operative relations in order to have at least one stabilizing factor during the difficult	56.697845458984375	340.47021484375	13.980010986328125	482.0219421386719	23
survival process. According to Ermischer and Preusche (1995: 55) „the co-operation	56.697845458984375	356.79046630859375	13.980010986328125	481.9940490722656	23
enhanced the plant level process of transformation and helped to compensate for the	56.69647216796875	373.1107177734375	13.980010986328125	482.01361083984375	23
lack of experience of both management and the works council with the strange	56.69648742675781	389.43096923828125	13.980010986328125	481.90171813964844	23
economic and legal system“. One should also note that the common „enemy“, the	56.69648742675781	405.751220703125	13.980010986328125	481.90733337402344	23
Treuhand (the state privatisation agency) arguably induced „emergency associations“	56.696502685546875	422.07147216796875	13.980010986328125	482.0499572753906	23

Thirdly, there was the particularly unifying aim of (a) preparing the enterprise for	85.07589721679688	457.71209716796875	13.980010986328125	453.7502746582031	23
the market economy (e.g. Dathe and Schreiber 1993: 9), and (b) of dismantling the	56.695098876953125	474.0323486328125	13.980010986328125	482.0541076660156	23
political structures, i.e. „de-ideologisation“ of the work structure and organisation (e.g.	56.695098876953125	490.35260009765625	13.980010986328125	482.0457458496094	23
getting rid of the „red socks“). Some even argue that there has been a third unifying	56.69508361816406	506.6728210449219	13.980010986328125	482.07786560058594	23
aim, the development of more employee involvement (Ermischer and Preusche 1992: 2).	56.695068359375	522.9931640625	13.980010986328125	481.7227783203125	23
In sum, these authors conclude that co-management generally emerged in their	85.074462890625	542.3134765625	13.980010986328125	453.64959716796875	23

(turnaround). Ermischer and Preusche's empirical investigation (interviews in 34	56.695068359375	574.9539794921875	13.979995727539062	482.03179931640625	23

conclusion on the finding that in the majority of cases the management and works	56.69505310058594	607.594482421875	13.979995727539062	481.97731018066406	23
council saw their relationship as a positive, co-operative relationship with the aim of	56.695068359375	623.9147338867188	13.979995727539062	481.957763671875	23
achieving consensus (1993: 185).	56.69508361816406	640.2349853515625	13.979995727539062	187.49560546875	23
It is a weakness of these studies that we are not told which interview questions	85.07447814941406	659.5553588867188	13.979995727539062	453.57273864746094	23
were asked, nor are important terms like „co-operation“ clearly defined. For example,	56.69366455078125	675.8756103515625	13.979995727539062	481.96044921875	23
the perception of „shared goals“ does not necessarily lead to an effective	56.69364929199219	692.1958618164062	13.979995727539062	481.96888732910156	23
codetermination, i.e. co-operation. It is also possible that if a works council shares the	56.69366455078125	708.51611328125	13.980003356933594	481.9744873046875	23
same goals as management, it does not see the need to become pro-active.	56.693695068359375	724.8363647460938	13.980003356933594	413.6150207519531	23
This view is supported by the other school of thought on these issues who propose	85.07305908203125	744.15673828125	13.980003356933594	453.785400390625	23
that co-operative works councils in East Germany are „extended arms of management“	56.693660736083984	760.4769897460938	13.980003356933594	482.237247467041	23

rather than „independent“ and effective worker institutions. Some of their arguments	56.70000076293945	73.345947265625	13.97998046875	482.18134689331055	26
will be reviewed: Jander and Lutz (1991: 411) of the Berlin/Göttingen group found in	56.70001220703125	89.66619873046875	13.97998046875	482.17156982421875	26
their surveys3 that cases of pro-active works councils were the exception rather than the	56.70002746582031	103.32244873046875	16.64398193359375	482.16795349121094	26
rule, and they speculate that these were likely to have been concentrated around Leipzig	56.699188232421875	122.30621337890625	13.97998046875	482.2261047363281	26
and Dresden (the home of the civil movement). They also found that even in the	56.699188232421875	138.62646484375	13.97998046875	482.1729431152344	26
beginning, when works councils formally attended management meetings, they did not	56.699188232421875	154.94671630859375	13.97998046875	482.1897888183594	26
participate greatly in the decision making, but basically agreed to decisions which	56.69920349121094	171.2669677734375	13.97998046875	482.16590881347656	26
sounded economically rational. For example, there was no works council in their sample	56.69920349121094	187.58721923828125	13.97998046875	482.16737365722656	26
which had developed alternatives to management's reconstruction concept. In general,	56.699188232421875	203.907470703125	13.97998046875	482.2037048339844	26
works councillors were found to be very open to economic arguments because of their	56.69915771484375	220.22772216796875	13.97998046875	482.262451171875	26
belief that economic irrationality led the former system into ruin. Economic rationality	56.69914245605469	236.5479736328125	13.97998046875	482.1897735595703	26
and especially technological progress were often seen as panaceas (also Dathe and	56.69914245605469	252.86822509765625	13.97998046875	482.23316955566406	26
Schreiber 1993: 42; David 1992: 132-134). Mickler et al.'s case study of VW gives an	56.69914245605469	269.1884765625	13.97998046875	482.17994689941406	26
impressive account of the works council's agreement to the introduction of lean	56.699127197265625	285.50872802734375	13.97998046875	482.1561584472656	26
production without any restrictions (1992: 16). Moreover, according to Jander and Lutz	56.699127197265625	301.8289794921875	13.97998046875	482.1897277832031	26
(ibid.) East German works councils generally did not (and still do not) mobilize against	56.699127197265625	318.14923095703125	13.980010986328125	482.2484436035156	26
staff reductions, because they are accepted as unavoidable, and avoid any politicisation	56.699127197265625	334.469482421875	13.980010986328125	482.1967468261719	26
of labour relations, since this is seen as a core reason for the old mis-management.	56.699127197265625	350.78973388671875	13.980010986328125	482.1030578613281	26
Consequently, as Kädtler and Kottwitz (1994: 27) argue, the „works council as a	56.69914245605469	367.1099853515625	13.980010986328125	482.09742736816406	26
partner/arm of management“ is often believed by works councillors themselves to be the	56.69914245605469	383.43023681640625	13.980010986328125	482.1939239501953	26
ideal type (see Kotthoff's typology below). Accordingly, as the authors conclude, the	56.69914245605469	399.75048828125	13.980010986328125	482.1142120361328	26
relationship between management and works council is not seen by the councillors as	56.699127197265625	416.07073974609375	13.980010986328125	482.1659851074219	26
the expression of any fundamental conflict of interest but as a „functional	56.699127197265625	432.3909912109375	13.980010986328125	482.1477355957031	26
complementary relationship“. Similarly, their study found that works councils, having	56.699127197265625	448.71124267578125	13.980010986328125	482.2121276855469	26
realized that their scope for action is very limited, were persuaded that co-operation is	56.69911193847656	465.031494140625	13.980010986328125	482.1827850341797	26
the best posture. The authors mention that „it is not the announcement of a third or	56.70050048828125	481.35174560546875	13.980010986328125	482.016357421875	26

(p.28). Thus, only when informal norms were violated, did the works council become	56.70051574707031	530.3125	13.980010986328125	482.1869354248047	26

Jander and Lutz also remark that the early attendance of the works council at	85.0794677734375	565.9462890625	13.980010986328125	453.73492431640625	27
board meetings in some firms could easily be seen more as a management strategy to	56.70008850097656	582.2665405273438	13.979995727539062	482.10594177246094	27

management. In addition, Kädtler (1992: 8-10) cannot find any evidence to suggest that	56.7000732421875	614.9070434570312	13.979995727539062	482.14501953125	27

broader participation rights had been kept, the outcome of „co-management“ would	56.70001220703125	122.30670166015625	13.97998046875	482.11566162109375	33
have been the same, largely due to the particular economic and political context.	56.70001220703125	138.626953125	13.97998046875	440.0274658203125	33
There is more agreement among analysts as the quality of workplace relations	85.08082580566406	157.94732666015625	13.97998046875	453.56150817871094	33
after privatisation. The workforce, works council and management no longer jointly	56.700042724609375	174.228271484375	14.019287109375	482.0052185058594	33
face the Treuhand in safeguarding the interests of the enterprise. It is argued that the	56.701416015625	190.58782958984375	13.97998046875	481.9296875	33
classic division of interests between capital and labour therefore becomes more	56.701416015625	206.9080810546875	13.97998046875	481.988525390625	33
explicit (Ermischer and Preusche 1995: 59; Lungwitz and Preusche 1994). Workplace	56.70140075683594	223.22833251953125	13.97998046875	481.98707580566406	33
relations become characterized on the one side by management strengthening its	56.701416015625	239.548583984375	13.97998046875	481.9898681640625	33
position (e.g. legitimized by new owners or by a management buy-out), and	56.701416015625	255.86883544921875	13.97998046875	481.95770263671875	33
frequently reinforcing „taylorist“ control and disciplinary methods (e.g. Bluhm 1992;	56.701416015625	272.1890869140625	13.97998046875	481.9912109375	33
Lippold et al. 1992; Voskamp and Wittke 1991). On the other side the deteriorating	56.70143127441406	288.50933837890625	13.97998046875	481.96470642089844	33
economic situation is regarded as to reduce the task of works councils to that of	56.701446533203125	304.82958984375	13.97998046875	481.9171447753906	33
administrating redundancies instead of „co-managing“ the on-going reorganisation.	56.70143127441406	321.14984130859375	13.980010986328125	481.95762634277344	33
For example, Mickler et al.'s case study (e.g. 1992) of the new Volkswagen car	56.701416015625	337.4700927734375	13.980010986328125	481.966064453125	33
factory in Saxony showed that the informal „survival pacts“ which existed in 1990	56.70001220703125	353.79034423828125	13.980010986328125	482.00238037109375	33
were starting to fall apart by 1992: management wanted more productivity and the	56.70001220703125	370.110595703125	13.980010986328125	481.96051025390625	33
workforce wanted to keep their traditional piece rates and customs. Thus, Mickler et	56.70001220703125	386.43084716796875	13.980010986328125	482.02337646484375	33
al. write that it is „not the democratisation of workplace relations, but company’s	56.69999694824219	402.7510986328125	13.980010986328125	481.95484924316406	33
survival, massive redundancies and the securing of a minimum social standard	56.699981689453125	419.07135009765625	13.980010986328125	481.9157409667969	33
[which] determines the daily work of the councils“ (1993: 21). Finally, it is argued	56.69999694824219	435.3916015625	13.980010986328125	481.91578674316406	33
that privatisation often leads to the employment of West German or foreign managers	56.699981689453125	451.71185302734375	13.980010986328125	482.0345764160156	33
who are likely to challenge the established East German community (see Aderhold et	56.69999694824219	468.0321044921875	13.980010986328125	482.03871154785156	33

In sum, the literature on workplace relations in East German enterprises before	85.07940673828125	503.6726989746094	13.980010986328125	453.60205078125	33
privatisation can be categorized into two broad camps, a positive/optimistic one (e.g.	56.6986083984375	519.9930419921875	13.980010986328125	481.9827880859375	33
WISOC) who propose co-operative (and effective) works councils, and a negative/	56.6986083984375	536.313232421875	13.980010986328125	481.98974609375	33
pessimistic one (e.g. Berlin/Göttingen). Obviously, these two groups are „ideal	56.69859313964844	552.633544921875	13.980010986328125	481.9073028564453	33
types“. Both sides however agree that there has been a shift and deterioration in	56.6986083984375	568.9537353515625	13.980010986328125	481.98004150390625	33
works council-management relations over the years.	56.6986083984375	585.2739868164062	13.979995727539062	292.0869140625	33
The characterisation by some researchers of early workplace relations as co-	85.0780029296875	604.5943603515625	13.979995727539062	453.597900390625	33
operative would be enhanced by a precise definition of concepts such as „co-	56.6986083984375	620.9146118164062	13.979995727539062	481.98980712890625	33
operation“ or „co-management“. Was it „real“ co-operation, say between two equally	56.6986083984375	637.23486328125	13.979995727539062	481.99822998046875	33
strong partners,5 or a more one-sided acquiescence on the part of the works council?	56.6986083984375	650.8824462890625	16.652664184570312	481.953857421875	33
Furthermore, the argument that „co-operation“ has declined since privatisation does	56.70037841796875	669.8662109375	13.979995727539062	481.97027587890625	33
not say what it has been substituted by. Does „non-co-operation“ mean a conflictual	56.70036315917969	686.1864624023438	13.979995727539062	481.95899963378906	33
relationship or does it mean that the works council becomes (or continues to be) an	56.700347900390625	702.5067138671875	13.980003356933594	482.0414733886719	33
extended arm of management, thus administering management functions, as	56.70033264160156	718.8269653320312	13.980003356933594	481.9702606201172	33

Co-operation is often defined differently, e.g. that people willingly co-operate because of	85.08000183105469	759.4033203125	12.0	453.6359405517578	35

Mahnkopf (1991: 280) or Jander and Lutz (1991) argue? Obviously, it is difficult at	56.70000076293945	73.345947265625	13.97998046875	481.91718673706055	38

inevitably remain vague, e.g. Ermischer and Preusche's (1995: 60) conclusion that	56.70001220703125	105.9864501953125	13.97998046875	481.97161865234375	38
their case studies in 1994 show „more conflictual relations without the loss of co-	56.69999694824219	122.30670166015625	13.97998046875	481.94654846191406	38
operation“. In addition, the discussion on „co-management or conflict“ seems to be	56.70001220703125	138.626953125	13.97998046875	481.9981689453125	38
burdened with the problem that the authors seem to have different understandings of	56.70001220703125	154.94720458984375	13.97998046875	481.96331787109375	38
what they mean by these terms, and that the concepts themselves are difficult to	56.69999694824219	171.2674560546875	13.97998046875	481.94227600097656	38

Related to the question of co-operation is whether works councils manage to	85.07939147949219	241.2877197265625	13.97998046875	453.6062774658203	41
represent workers' interests effectively or not. However, there is little West German	56.698577880859375	257.56866455078125	14.019287109375	481.9800720214844	41

The only major study which focuses on the quality of interest representation is	56.698577880859375	306.5687255859375	13.97998046875	482.0010681152344	41

created a useful typology of works councils and distinguished between: (i) deficient	56.69964599609375	339.2062072753906	13.980010986328125	482.03875732421875	41
forms of interest representation: „the ignored works council“; „the isolated works	56.69964599609375	355.5264587402344	13.980010986328125	481.94793701171875	41

forms of (autonomous) interest representation: „the respected, co-operative works	56.69964599609375	388.1669616699219	13.980010986328125	481.94512939453125	41

operative hostile power“. There is no corresponding East German research on this	56.69964599609375	420.8074645996094	13.980010986328125	482.037353515625	41
issue, which is partly explained by the fact that it is especially hard to measure the	56.69966125488281	437.1277160644531	13.980010986328125	481.97300720214844	41
effectiveness of interest representation during times of transformation. The most	56.69964599609375	453.4479675292969	13.980010986328125	481.99676513671875	41
common approach in the current East German literature is to outline some problems	56.69964599609375	469.7682189941406	13.980010986328125	481.91583251953125	41
which works councils are currently facing and to assert (rather than to analyse) that	56.69964599609375	486.0884704589844	13.980010986328125	481.985595703125	41
these problems hinder the proper functioning of works councils. There are at least	56.69964599609375	502.4087219238281	13.980010986328125	481.81219482421875	41
five problems mentioned in the literature (more by the Berlin/Göttingen group, e.g.	56.69964599609375	518.72900390625	13.980010986328125	481.9591064453125	41

them: (i) the intensified classical dilemma facing works councils of balancing the	56.69964599609375	551.3695068359375	13.980010986328125	481.9801025390625	41

East Germany (e.g. Kottwitz 1991: 417); (ii) the unsuitability of the West German	56.69966125488281	584.010009765625	13.979995727539062	481.95628356933594	41

which is the absence of prosperous companies which are said to be a precondition for	56.69964599609375	616.6505126953125	13.979995727539062	482.08355712890625	41

supposedly low image of the works council among the workforce, i.e. workers perceive	56.70001220703125	89.66619873046875	13.97998046875	482.10443115234375	46
works councils as ineffective (e.g. Jander et al. 1992).	56.70001220703125	105.9864501953125	13.97998046875	294.8730773925781	46
Kädtler and Kottwitz (1993: 4) go so far as to suggest that these deficiencies in	85.07940673828125	125.30682373046875	13.97998046875	453.59088134765625	46
workplace relations have implications for the functioning of the whole industrial	56.70001220703125	141.6270751953125	13.97998046875	481.8780517578125	46
relations system. According to Jander and Lutz (1993) there is the paradox that	56.70002746582031	157.94732666015625	13.97998046875	481.9269256591797	46
although the West German industrial relations system was transferred without any	56.70001220703125	174.267578125	13.97998046875	481.9842529296875	46
adjustments to the particular East German situation, East Germany could very well	56.70001220703125	190.58782958984375	13.97998046875	482.027587890625	46
end up not practising the same industrial relations as the West, especially because of	56.70001220703125	206.9080810546875	13.97998046875	481.9339599609375	46
the ineffective works councils (see also Jacoby 1994). For these researchers therefore	56.70001220703125	223.22833251953125	13.97998046875	481.9632568359375	46
the likely scenario is of a few companies with „good“ workplace relations surrounded	56.70001220703125	239.548583984375	13.97998046875	481.82061767578125	46
by a majority of companies with poor co-determination practices (see also Mahnkopf	56.70001220703125	255.86883544921875	13.97998046875	482.0303955078125	46
1991).	56.70001220703125	272.1890869140625	13.97998046875	36.187232971191406	46
However, listing possible reasons why works councils might not be effective is	85.07940673828125	291.50946044921875	13.97998046875	453.68743896484375	46
not an entirely satisfactory exercise. The authors do not provide persuasive evidence as	56.700008392333984	307.8297119140625	13.97998046875	482.0779457092285	46
to why these problems render works councils ineffective, nor do they analyse whether	56.70001220703125	324.14996337890625	13.980010986328125	482.108642578125	46
these supposed problems are short-term (due to the novelty of the institutions) or long-	56.70001220703125	340.47021484375	13.980010986328125	482.04156494140625	46
term (due to the structural unsuitability of western regulations in the East).	56.70001220703125	356.79046630859375	13.980010986328125	482.09320068359375	46
Furthermore, it has also not been tested how far these problems, rather than, for	56.69999694824219	373.1107177734375	13.980010986328125	482.11146545410156	46
example, unco-operative management, account for any works council ineffectiveness.	56.69999694824219	389.43096923828125	13.980010986328125	482.10865783691406	46
There are also problems with the arguments as such. To give just one example: arguing	56.701385498046875	405.751220703125	13.980010986328125	482.0904846191406	46
that the West German system is not suitable for the specific East German situation does	56.701385498046875	422.07147216796875	13.980010986328125	482.1310729980469	46
not provide a convincing explanation why this should evoke a dysfunctioning of the	56.701385498046875	438.3917236328125	13.980010986328125	482.0318298339844	46
works council. Without wanting to go into the debate as to how far the situation in the	56.701385498046875	454.71197509765625	13.980010986328125	482.0959777832031	46
East today is comparable with that of West Germany after 1945 (see Jacoby 1994), it	56.701385498046875	471.0322265625	13.980010986328125	482.0722961425781	46
seems a dubious assertion that the West German industrial relations system only	56.70140075683594	487.35247802734375	13.980010986328125	482.1352081298828	46
„works“ in prosperous economic situations. The system seems to have managed	56.70140075683594	503.6726989746094	13.980010986328125	482.0625762939453	46

As said before most of the studies are based solely on interviews with	85.08082580566406	539.3133544921875	13.980010986328125	453.62022399902344	46
councillors (and sometimes with management). Very few came from more	56.70001220703125	555.6336669921875	13.980010986328125	481.93798828125	46

towards the new institutions. This study attempts to contribute to the analysis of the	56.69999694824219	588.2741088867188	13.979995727539062	481.8626251220703	46
quality of workplace relations in East German firms in two ways. Co-operative	56.70001220703125	604.5943603515625	13.979995727539062	481.98419189453125	46
workplace relations will be investigated by focusing on one side, works councillors'	56.69999694824219	620.9146118164062	13.979995727539062	481.91578674316406	46
attitudes towards management, only. Moreover, the study examines the „customers“	56.699981689453125	637.23486328125	13.979995727539062	481.9017639160156	46
of works councils, the workforce, and analyse their perceptions of the works council's	56.699981689453125	653.5551147460938	13.979995727539062	481.9619445800781	46

The study comprised two surveys, one of works councillors and one of	85.07939147949219	723.5753784179688	13.980003356933594	453.59645080566406	49

only very few former managers. At the supervisory level nothing really had changed,	56.698638916015625	318.44891357421875	13.980010986328125	482.0052185058594	63

supervisory level and changes in management. Thus, privately owned firms had not	56.70037841796875	367.4064636230469	13.980010986328125	481.9801025390625	63

With regard to staff reductions, most firms had reduced their staff by at least	85.08114624023438	403.04705810546875	13.980010986328125	453.7697448730469	63

regard to the medium-term prospects of their firms, the respondents were split: 22 were	56.70111083984375	435.68621826171875	13.980010986328125	482.1463623046875	63
sceptical and 20 were more optimistic. Privately owned firms were more optimistic	56.69970703125	452.0064697265625	13.980010986328125	482.160400390625	63
than Treuhand firms, and firms with new management felt more secure than those with	56.69970703125	468.32672119140625	13.980010986328125	482.1129150390625	63

and in 16 it was higher than 90%. This confirms the female dominance in the textile	56.69996643066406	549.9268798828125	13.980010986328125	482.04844665527344	63

unsecure firms, but not necessarily stronger in Treuhand firms compared to private	56.69996643066406	615.2078857421875	13.979995727539062	482.1897430419922	63

The idea was to apply a set of previously tested questions here in order to	85.07952880859375	208.46563720703125	13.97998046875	453.617431640625	72

workplace situation. In addition, this small-scale survey is not able to establish	56.69873046875	257.4263916015625	13.97998046875	481.89337158203125	72

it might be a first approach to investigate the two opposite hypotheses of the	56.69873046875	290.06689453125	13.97998046875	481.92413330078125	72

company (r= .29*) and whether the councillor was a former BGL official (r= .27*):	56.70074462890625	640.346435546875	13.979995727539062	481.98699951171875	79
Works councillors in a company with no former directors were more likely to	56.70074462890625	656.666748046875	13.979995727539062	482.03179931640625	79

councillors who were not former BGL officials were more likely to perceive the	56.70074462890625	689.3072509765625	13.979995727539062	482.0052490234375	79
relationship as good than works councillors who were former BGL officials. This was	56.70074462890625	705.6275024414062	13.980003356933594	482.0150146484375	79
also confirmed by t-tests. Thus, contrary to some suggestions in the literature (e.g.	56.70074462890625	721.94775390625	13.980003356933594	481.91436767578125	79

Furthermore, the general perception of the workplace relations is correlated with	85.07939147949219	108.986572265625	13.97998046875	453.59498596191406	84
the following questions: the more works councils were involved in strategic planning	56.699981689453125	125.30682373046875	13.97998046875	481.9661560058594	84
(r= .35*) or feel sufficiently informed (r= -.38**), the more they perceived a positive	56.699981689453125	141.6270751953125	13.97998046875	481.8988952636719	84
relationship with management and the less likely they described management as	56.69996643066406	157.94732666015625	13.97998046875	482.0276336669922	84
strengthening its power. Moreover, companies which had not experienced industrial	56.69996643066406	174.267578125	13.97998046875	482.0359344482422	84
conflicts were more likely to have this harmonious relationship (r= .35*).	56.699951171875	190.58782958984375	13.97998046875	481.95489501953125	84
Furthermore, t-tests found that the more insecure the future of the firm, the more the	56.699951171875	206.9080810546875	13.97998046875	481.8724365234375	84
works council saw the need for harmonious relationships (in the best interest of the	56.69993591308594	223.22833251953125	13.97998046875	481.97438049316406	84
workforce). This is a very interesting finding. At first sight one might interpret good	56.69993591308594	239.548583984375	13.97998046875	481.98841857910156	84
relationships with management as coming out of a weak bargaining position of the	56.699951171875	255.86883544921875	13.97998046875	481.91717529296875	84
works council. However, it seems more likely that it means that difficult times bind	56.69993591308594	272.1890869140625	13.97998046875	482.05409240722656	84
the two sides together.	56.69993591308594	288.50933837890625	13.97998046875	125.94999694824219	84
Finally, t-tests revealed that companies with former managers were more likely	85.07933044433594	307.8297119140625	13.97998046875	453.6621856689453	84
to have informal negotiations. This might indicate a legacy of former socialist	56.69854736328125	324.14996337890625	13.980010986328125	482.00518798828125	84
workplace relations in firms with predominantly former managerial staff, as has been	56.69854736328125	340.47021484375	13.980010986328125	481.99822998046875	84
suggested in previous studies (e.g. Ermischer and Preusche 1993). Obviously it is	56.69854736328125	356.79046630859375	13.980010986328125	481.92425537109375	84
difficult to evaluate at this stage whether this is a temporary or a permanent	56.69854736328125	373.1107177734375	13.980010986328125	481.9674072265625	84
phenomenon.	56.69854736328125	389.43096923828125	13.980010986328125	75.75480651855469	84
With regard to the second factor („general views of management“) the overall	85.07794189453125	408.7513427734375	13.980010986328125	453.617431640625	84
result is less positive. Management was perceived untrustful and as trying to	56.69853210449219	425.07159423828125	13.980010986328125	482.03871154785156	84
strengthen its power (t-tests revealed that this is more perceived in financially	56.698516845703125	441.391845703125	13.980010986328125	481.9981994628906	84
„secure“ than in „insecure“ firms). In addition, the councillors acknowledged the	56.69853210449219	457.71209716796875	13.980010986328125	481.95484924316406	84
conflicting interests of employers and unions. If management was perceived to be	56.69854736328125	474.0323486328125	13.980010986328125	481.99267578125	84
seeking to strengthen its power, works councils were also more likely to perceive	56.69854736328125	490.35260009765625	13.980010986328125	482.027587890625	84
union–employer relations as antagonistic (r= .31*). However, t-tests did not reveal a	56.69854736328125	506.6728210449219	13.980010986328125	481.9437255859375	84
significant difference between private and state ownership with regard to perceptions	56.698577880859375	522.9931640625	13.980010986328125	481.9745178222656	84
of different interests.	56.698577880859375	539.3133544921875	13.980010986328125	116.99583435058594	84
In sum, it seems that although the works councillors were convinced of the	85.07797241210938	558.6337890625	13.980010986328125	453.5922546386719	84
desirability of harmonious relations, and were willing to do its part, they realised that	56.698577880859375	574.9539794921875	13.979995727539062	481.9674377441406	84
management was sometimes less willing to co-operate, and they perceived a	56.69720458984375	591.2742309570312	13.979995727539062	481.9940185546875	84
difference of interests of both sides.	56.69720458984375	607.594482421875	13.979995727539062	200.56967163085938	84
Regarding the second part of the questionnaire, works councils were described	85.07659912109375	626.9148559570312	13.979995727539062	453.62298583984375	84
primarily as connecting links between management and workforce, thus not as a pure	56.69580078125	643.235107421875	13.979995727539062	481.94793701171875	84
interest representation, and consequently the well-being of the company was seen as	56.69580078125	659.5553588867188	13.979995727539062	481.996826171875	84
of prime importance. This is also a typical phenomenon in West German studies (e.g.	56.69580078125	675.8756103515625	13.979995727539062	482.072265625	84

The data also adds support to the argument in the literature that „plant-level	56.69580078125	708.51611328125	13.980003356933594	481.96600341796875	84

egoism“17 predominates East German works councils (e.g. Lippold et al. 1992;	56.70000076293945	70.68243408203125	16.64349365234375	482.0406608581543	87

Furthermore, management was seen as pursuing a trustworthy relationship with	85.07997131347656	108.986572265625	13.97998046875	453.57542419433594	87
the workforce, which correlated with the general perception of good workplace	56.69917297363281	125.30682373046875	13.97998046875	481.9800262451172	87

between management and workforce (r= .32*). Interestingly, the higher the share of	56.69917297363281	157.94732666015625	13.97998046875	481.88780212402344	87
females in the workforce, the more management was perceived as fostering a trustful	56.699188232421875	174.267578125	13.97998046875	482.0010681152344	87

(r= .31*). However there was no significant difference between private and state	56.699188232421875	206.9080810546875	13.97998046875	481.9506530761719	87

Finally, the workforce was perceived as supporting the works council, especially	85.07861328125	242.5487060546875	13.97998046875	453.56573486328125	87
in firms employing few former directors. Thus, the councillors argued that workplace	56.69781494140625	258.86895751953125	13.97998046875	481.9017333984375	87
relations are generally better in firms with new management than with the old	56.69779968261719	275.189208984375	13.97998046875	481.98146057128906	87
directors. Yet, the workforce is said to support the works council more in firms with	56.69779968261719	291.50946044921875	13.97998046875	481.96742248535156	87
new management. One could follow that the works council saw privatisation and new	56.69779968261719	307.8297119140625	13.97998046875	481.9534454345703	87

The findings of the works councillor questionnaire contribute to two	85.07939910888672	95.686767578125	14.019287109375	453.57129669189453	107
propositions of the literature reviewed. Firstly, they cannot support the widespread	56.6986083984375	112.04632568359375	13.97998046875	481.924072265625	107
claim of researchers that workplace relations were more antagonistic or that the	56.6986083984375	128.3665771484375	13.97998046875	481.9730224609375	107
works council was pushed to the sidelines after privatisation. Clearly, this data is a	56.69862365722656	144.68682861328125	13.97998046875	481.9548797607422	107
„snap shot“, not longitudinal and thus does not provide information on possible	56.698638916015625	161.007080078125	13.97998046875	481.9981994628906	107
changes before and after privatisation. Furthermore, the small sample and the limited	56.698638916015625	177.32733154296875	13.97998046875	482.0387878417969	107
number of questions do not allow a final judgement on the quality of works council-	56.698638916015625	193.6475830078125	13.97998046875	481.8905334472656	107
management relations. However, the data gives a first indication that the current	56.69862365722656	209.96783447265625	13.97998046875	481.9338836669922	107
relationship in these firms, which are mostly privatised, was generally harmonious.	56.69862365722656	226.2880859375	13.97998046875	481.93809509277344	107
Thus, the data adds support to the argument of „co-management“ by the WISOC	56.698638916015625	242.60833740234375	13.97998046875	481.9618835449219	107
group (e.g. Ermischer and Preusche 1992). Moreover, it challenges the argument that	56.698638916015625	258.9285888671875	13.97998046875	482.0820617675781	107
co-management is at risk in firms after privatisation (e.g. Ermischer and Preusche	56.698638916015625	275.24884033203125	13.97998046875	481.9842224121094	107
1995: 59), and that privatisation is likely to cause a polarisation between the two	56.698638916015625	291.569091796875	13.97998046875	481.9758605957031	107
sides (e.g. Kern and Land 1991). In contrast, the data revealed that co-operation was	56.698638916015625	307.88934326171875	13.97998046875	482.0093688964844	107
more likely where there were „new“ managers and „new“ works councillors. A rather	56.698638916015625	324.2095947265625	13.980010986328125	481.9591369628906	107
straightforward interpretation for this perhaps surprising finding is that the old	56.69865417480469	340.52984619140625	13.980010986328125	481.8723907470703	107
relations between directors and worker representatives were highly distrustful and	56.69866943359375	356.85009765625	13.980010986328125	482.01922607421875	107
conflictual and privatisation enabled „fresh blood“ to make a new start. This assumes	56.69865417480469	373.17034912109375	13.980010986328125	481.94508361816406	107
that both sides perceive co-operative relations as worthwhile (the councillors	56.69865417480469	389.4906005859375	13.980010986328125	481.9633331298828	107
acknowledged this).	56.69865417480469	405.81085205078125	13.980010986328125	112.72212219238281	107
Secondly, the findings oppose the fears of some researchers (especially the	85.07804870605469	425.1312255859375	13.980010986328125	453.59645080566406	107
Berlin/Göttingen group) that works councils are powerless „extended arms of	56.697235107421875	441.45147705078125	13.980010986328125	481.9758605957031	107
management“. Although the councillors in this sample are obviously not „conflictual,	56.697235107421875	457.771728515625	13.980010986328125	481.9255676269531	107
class conscious works councils“ and strongly antagonistic (see Kotthoff's typology	56.697235107421875	474.09197998046875	13.980010986328125	481.9730529785156	107
above), they are very aware of the different interests of capital and labour and also of	56.69721984863281	490.4122314453125	13.980010986328125	482.04161071777344	107
the power balance within the firm and do not necessarily trust management. Thus,	56.697235107421875	506.7325134277344	13.980010986328125	481.9353332519531	107
they surely do not represent Kotthoff's „deficient“ types of works councils (isolated,	56.697235107421875	523.052734375	13.980010986328125	481.9968566894531	107
ignored, extended arm of management), but more his „effective“ types, in particular	56.697235107421875	539.373046875	13.980010986328125	482.0122375488281	107
the „respected, co- operative“ works council. In other words, the data supports more	56.697235107421875	555.6932373046875	13.980010986328125	481.9339294433594	107
the hypothesis of co-operative relationships than that of a one-sided acquiescence on	56.697235107421875	572.0135498046875	13.980010986328125	481.9366760253906	107
the part of the works councils. However, the survey certainly does not allow any final	56.697235107421875	588.333740234375	13.979995727539062	481.9562683105469	107
conclusion regarding the practical effectiveness of the works councils' interest	56.69725036621094	604.6539916992188	13.979995727539062	481.9577178955078	107
representation, and therefore the categorisation can be only speculative. The real	56.697265625	620.9742431640625	13.979995727539062	482.02197265625	107
effectiveness of these councils is better to be explored by methods such as non-	56.69725036621094	637.2944946289062	13.979995727539062	481.9898223876953	107
participative observation or interviews with the workforce or by the workforce	56.697265625	653.61474609375	13.979995727539062	481.91986083984375	107
questionnaires. However, the finding that the works councils felt strongly supported	56.695831298828125	669.9349975585938	13.979995727539062	481.9380798339844	107
by the workforce might be a first indicator of the works councils' functioning and	56.69581604003906	686.2552490234375	13.979995727539062	481.8696746826172	107
indeed its effectiveness.	56.69581604003906	702.5755004882812	13.980003356933594	134.00389099121094	107
With regard to the membership questionnaire the three major findings are firstly	85.07521057128906	721.8565673828125	14.019309997558594	453.5475311279297	107
the overall acceptance of the works council as a necessary institution, and a clear	56.69439697265625	738.2161254882812	13.980003356933594	481.94091796875	107
preference for the new interest institution. This also confirms the preliminary	56.69439697265625	754.536376953125	13.980003356933594	481.98565673828125	107
Industrielle Beziehungen, 4. Jg., Heft 3, 1997	56.70000076293945	44.25262451171875	10.01995849609375	182.13554000854492	108

suggestion in the works council questionnaire, that works councils saw themselves	56.70000076293945	73.345947265625	13.97998046875	481.95209884643555	110
being accepted by their workforce.	56.70001220703125	89.66619873046875	13.97998046875	194.71205139160156	110
The second major result refers to the divided views on the works council's actual	85.07940673828125	108.986572265625	13.97998046875	453.63568115234375	110
work. One needs to address how this finding relates to the hypothesis in the literature	56.70002746582031	125.30682373046875	13.97998046875	481.99681091308594	110
that workers are highly disillusioned over the effectiveness of works councils (with	56.700042724609375	141.6270751953125	13.97998046875	481.9772644042969	110
respect to the redundancies, co-management etc.). Workers were realistic about the	56.700042724609375	157.94732666015625	13.97998046875	481.9828796386719	110
limited resources of works councils in these economic circumstances. This might be	56.700042724609375	174.267578125	13.97998046875	481.9912414550781	110
disappointing, yet it did not lead people to reject the institution as such. In short,	56.70005798339844	190.58782958984375	13.97998046875	481.9480743408203	110
although the findings do not suggest highly effective and powerful institutions,	56.70005798339844	206.9080810546875	13.97998046875	481.94374084472656	110
workers conclude that this is related more to the external conditions than to the design	56.7000732421875	223.22833251953125	13.97998046875	481.80670166015625	110
of the institution as such. One should add that this result might be biased by the fact	56.70008850097656	239.548583984375	13.97998046875	481.9982147216797	110
that only union members were asked. However, this survey was also distributed to	56.70008850097656	255.86883544921875	13.97998046875	481.98143005371094	110
non-union members in the largest firm of our sample and the results for this firm did	56.7000732421875	272.1890869140625	13.97998046875	482.00372314453125	110
not reveal any significant differences between non-union members and members in	56.7000732421875	288.50933837890625	13.97998046875	482.01214599609375	110
this respect (see Frege 1996a, chp. 9). In sum, the data adds support to the more	56.7000732421875	304.82958984375	13.97998046875	481.924072265625	110
positive studies about workers' attitudes towards the works council, such as Heering	56.70005798339844	321.14984130859375	13.980010986328125	481.97169494628906	110

towards their works council (the precise question is however not published); and	56.700042724609375	353.79034423828125	13.980010986328125	481.9967956542969	110
challenges pessimistic studies such as Jander et al. (1992). Moreover, the large-scale	56.700042724609375	370.110595703125	13.980010986328125	481.9170837402344	110

the German working population (employed and unemployed) every other year (since	56.700042724609375	402.7510986328125	13.980010986328125	481.9800720214844	110
1992 in the East and West), on their attitudes towards interest institutions, shows that	56.700042724609375	419.07135009765625	13.980010986328125	481.9829406738281	110
a majority of East German employees value the works councils' work in 1994 slightly	56.700042724609375	435.3916015625	13.980010986328125	481.8835754394531	110
more than in 1992, although they were still more critical than in the West: in 1994	56.700042724609375	451.71185302734375	13.980010986328125	481.9870300292969	110
32% of East Germans valued the work (46% West Germans), 30% marked it	56.700042724609375	468.0321044921875	13.980010986328125	481.9241027832031	110
negatively (25%). In particular, our data is more positive than the DGB results for the	56.70002746582031	484.35235595703125	13.980010986328125	481.9185028076172	110
GTB (West and East): These were in 1992 considerably below the DGB German	56.700042724609375	500.6725769042969	13.980010986328125	481.9479064941406	110
average with only 6% approving the works council's work (no separate data for	56.700042724609375	516.992919921875	13.980010986328125	482.0080261230469	110
1994). However 59% did not answer and the sample consisted of only 83 persons,	56.700042724609375	533.3131103515625	13.980010986328125	481.9521179199219	110
which questions the data's reliability.21	56.700042724609375	546.9623413085938	16.651092529296875	216.35995483398438	110
Finally, the third result refers to members' strong willingness to participate in	85.07933044433594	568.9462890625	13.980010986328125	453.5937042236328	111
certain works council activities and their conviction that workers' support is a	56.69854736328125	585.2665405273438	13.979995727539062	481.94927978515625	111
necessary condition for works councils' effectiveness. This underlines workers'	56.69854736328125	601.5867919921875	13.979995727539062	482.0709228515625	111
acceptance of the new institution and a conviction of its basic instrumentality.	56.69854736328125	617.9070434570312	13.979995727539062	481.94927978515625	111
Besides, the data supports an established western theory that members are far easier	56.69854736328125	634.227294921875	13.979995727539062	482.0457763671875	111
to mobilize for selective collective actions than for continuous voluntary	56.69853210449219	650.5475463867188	13.979995727539062	482.00514221191406	111
commitments. A similar distinction has also been found in the questions on union	56.698516845703125	666.8677978515625	13.979995727539062	481.9408264160156	111
participation (see Frege 1996b) and also in West German studies. For example,	56.698516845703125	683.1880493164062	13.979995727539062	481.9842224121094	111
Wiedenhofer (1979: 44) found 20% willing members to stand for works council	56.698516845703125	699.50830078125	13.979995727539062	481.9856262207031	111

Neither survey can provide the in-depth analysis of workplace relations that	85.07940673828125	143.3662109375	13.97998046875	453.56988525390625	120
intensive case studies can provide. On the other hand it is rare to see relatively large	56.698638916015625	159.68646240234375	13.97998046875	481.9897766113281	120
samples of works councils and unionized workers being examined together, and this	56.698638916015625	176.0067138671875	13.97998046875	481.9730529785156	120
in an industrial sector which is normally neglected in such an area of research.	56.698638916015625	192.32696533203125	13.97998046875	438.14434814453125	120
In a nutshell the works councillor data presented co-operative attitudes towards	85.07803344726562	211.6473388671875	13.97998046875	453.6342468261719	120
management, in particular in firms with „new“ managers and „new“ councillors.	56.69725036621094	227.96759033203125	13.97998046875	482.00941467285156	120
However, the councillors were cautious in trusting management and critical about	56.69725036621094	244.287841796875	13.97998046875	482.0205841064453	120
management's willingness to co-operate. They also did not perceive themselves as	56.69725036621094	260.60809326171875	13.97998046875	481.95631408691406	120
extended arms of management. Overall, it seems safe to say that co-operation might	56.697235107421875	276.9283447265625	13.97998046875	482.0038757324219	120
well be founded on the new transferred industrial relations institutions rather than	56.69725036621094	293.24859619140625	13.97998046875	481.9702911376953	120
being a legacy of the socialist times.	56.697265625	309.56884765625	13.97998046875	203.032958984375	120
Moreover, works councillors did not seem to neglect their representative tasks,	85.07666015625	328.88922119140625	13.980010986328125	453.617431640625	120
as has been proposed in various studies (e.g. Jander and Lutz 1991; Kädtler and	56.69586181640625	345.20947265625	13.980010986328125	482.0401611328125	120
Kottwitz 1994). This is supported by the worker survey. The data reveals that,	56.69584655761719	361.52972412109375	13.980010986328125	481.95912170410156	120
although successes were critically evaluated, workers were aware of the desperate	56.69586181640625	377.8499755859375	13.980010986328125	481.925537109375	120
economic situation limiting works council's possibilities. Thus the limited	56.69586181640625	394.17022705078125	13.980010986328125	481.96893310546875	120
effectiveness of works councils did not prejudice people's acceptance, legitimisation	56.69586181640625	410.490478515625	13.980010986328125	482.052734375	120
and support of the new institutions (contrary to Jander et al. 1992). The works	56.69586181640625	426.81072998046875	13.980010986328125	481.90753173828125	120
councils were widely accepted as a necessary and important interest institution at	56.69586181640625	443.1309814453125	13.980010986328125	481.9842529296875	120
workplace level.	56.69586181640625	459.45123291015625	13.980010986328125	92.37843322753906	120
In sum, both data sets support Kotthoff's category of an effective, respected and	85.07525634765625	478.7716064453125	13.980010986328125	453.6495361328125	120
co-operative works council (which was also the major category in his West German	56.695831298828125	495.09185791015625	13.980010986328125	481.9590759277344	120
study). This finding might stir up first doubts about the conclusion of some literature	56.695831298828125	511.4120788574219	13.980010986328125	481.9814758300781	120
(e.g. Mense-Petermann 1996) that qualitatively different workplace relations	56.695831298828125	527.732421875	13.980010986328125	482.0178527832031	120
becoming established in the East Germany (compared to the West). In addition, the	56.695831298828125	544.0526123046875	13.980010986328125	481.9408874511719	120
data also indicates a successful „institutionalisation“ of the works council. Thus, not	56.695831298828125	560.3729248046875	13.980010986328125	481.9325256347656	120
only were the works councils formally installed but also the „substantive“ or	56.69581604003906	576.693115234375	13.979995727539062	481.9786834716797	120
„normative“ establishment was successful in terms of the acceptance, legitimisation	56.69580078125	593.0133666992188	13.979995727539062	482.0135498046875	120
and support of the actors, i.e. workers, involved. This result stands in strong contrast	56.695770263671875	609.3336181640625	13.979995727539062	481.9646911621094	120
to that of studies which emphasize the lack of workers' support for works councils	56.695770263671875	625.6538696289062	13.979995727539062	481.9898376464844	120
and which postulate that the works councils have not yet been successfully	56.695770263671875	641.97412109375	13.979995727539062	482.0024719238281	120
institutionalised (e.g. Jander and Lutz 1993; Mahnkopf 1991: 280 pp; Lippold et al.	56.695770263671875	658.2943725585938	13.979995727539062	481.9576721191406	120
1992: 92; Spangenberg 1993: 20). Finally, this data provides a first indication that the	56.695770263671875	674.6146240234375	13.979995727539062	481.9730529785156	120
current problems of the East German works councils are far more likely to be caused	56.695770263671875	690.9348754882812	13.979995727539062	482.0275573730469	120

factors (i.e. institutional deficiencies, lacking support of workforce) or indeed	56.69575500488281	723.5753784179688	13.980003356933594	481.9576873779297	120
