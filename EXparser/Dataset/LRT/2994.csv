Hülya accepts a pre-arranged marriage (probably mainly	165.53982543945312	149.81549072265625	9.48004150390625	229.81881713867188	26

The interview with Hülya shows numerous aspects of life histories of Turkish	128.6999969482422	319.194580078125	9.48004150390625	303.4821319580078	29
migrant workers coming to Germany, which we consider as typical for the	128.6999969482422	330.7146911621094	9.47998046875	303.5542449951172	29
organised work migration to Germany in the sixties and early seventies. But it	128.6999969482422	342.2347717285156	9.47998046875	303.6111297607422	29
also shows features, which are unique and outstanding. Common structural	128.6999969482422	353.69512939453125	9.47998046875	303.68223571777344	29
features are, for example, the institutional processing of the workers by the	128.6999969482422	365.2152099609375	9.47998046875	303.5846405029297	29
recruiting, examination and selection strategies in Turkey and the intake and	128.70001220703125	376.73529052734375	9.47998046875	303.6054992675781	29
exploitation strategies by German firms (in Germany). Of course, all of these	128.70001220703125	388.1956481933594	9.47998046875	303.59881591796875	29
structural features are connected with deep experiences of extended suffering:	128.70001220703125	399.7157287597656	9.47998046875	303.60552978515625	29

metically isolated; of being the despicable marginalized stranger, who doesn’t	128.70001220703125	434.21624755859375	9.47998046875	303.6376953125	29
understand anything of importance to Germans; of being emotionally and mor-	128.70001220703125	445.736328125	9.47998046875	303.58270263671875	29
ally disoriented by being a cultural hybrid; of doing hard industrial work which	128.70001220703125	457.1966857910156	9.47998046875	303.63201904296875	29
one is not used to yet; of feeling estranged from oneself; of getting sick by	128.70001220703125	468.7167663574219	9.47998046875	303.6093444824219	29
exhaustion; etc.—But there are some other features in the interview with Hülya	128.70001220703125	480.2368469238281	9.47998046875	303.5951843261719	29
that are not as common as the just mentioned features. These other features	128.70001220703125	491.69720458984375	9.47998046875	303.6150207519531	29

she continues to stay alone as a marginalized person during the entire	158.0399932861328	560.69482421875	9.47998046875	274.19566345214844	30

be emotionally quite unstable. Hülya doesn’t see any future perspective for her	128.69960021972656	356.81878662109375	9.47998046875	303.6063995361328	41

father’s advice probably plays an important role in this context. Taking into	128.6995849609375	414.29974365234375	9.47998046875	303.5277404785156	41

(ll.145-146), Hülya at first fantasizes about and then plans to embark on a	128.69960021972656	126.83502197265625	9.48004150390625	303.63771057128906	45

There are two features of Hülya’s action plan to go to West Germany as a	140.03958129882812	184.3160400390625	9.48004150390625	292.1887512207031	45
guest worker, which seem to be special. First, Hülya is the youngest child of	128.69960021972656	195.83612060546875	9.48004150390625	303.69837951660156	45
the family and it can legitimately be asked, why is she the only member of the	128.69960021972656	207.2698974609375	9.50665283203125	303.5504913330078	45

labour migration? Being very young and female she seems to be the least fit	128.70053100585938	230.336669921875	9.48004150390625	303.61871337890625	45
family member for this type of rescue action—to be accomplished through hard	128.70053100585938	241.79705810546875	9.48004150390625	303.7467041015625	45

tion. Second, although Hülya painstakingly attempts to give the impression that	128.70053100585938	264.83721923828125	9.48004150390625	303.59600830078125	45
her family—especially her father and her mother—does not like to send her	128.70053100585938	276.297607421875	9.48004150390625	303.6747131347656	45
abroad, it is her father, who finally assists in the legal procedure of “making her	128.70053100585938	287.81768798828125	9.48004150390625	303.74676513671875	45
younger” to the effect that she can apply in advance to the administrative guest	128.70053100585938	299.3377685546875	9.48004150390625	303.5050048828125	45

in the administrative recruitment procedure for getting promising (healthy,	128.70053100585938	333.8383483886719	9.47998046875	303.5533447265625	45
bright, well educated, hard working) guest workers. He obviously is not only	128.70053100585938	345.2987060546875	9.47998046875	303.6955871582031	45

One gets the impression that it is not just Hülya, who pushes through her	140.04051208496094	391.3193054199219	9.47998046875	292.15647888183594	45

tive—perhaps even pushy—regarding her pursuit and realisation of the plan.	128.70053100585938	414.29974365234375	9.47998046875	303.673828125	45
Though being the youngest child, she appears to be the least embedded and	128.70053100585938	425.81982421875	9.47998046875	303.6235046386719	45
least rooted within the family structure and social structure of rural Turkey; she	128.70053100585938	437.33990478515625	9.47998046875	303.59503173828125	45
therefore is the one most “available” for uprooting and migration to Germany	128.70053100585938	448.8002624511719	9.47998046875	303.62066650390625	45

the youngest child she can least be helped in getting a good education and a	128.7005157470703	471.8404235839844	9.47998046875	303.60643005371094	45

Hülya undergoes the institutional procedure of being tested, examined and	128.6999969482422	556.3145751953125	9.47998046875	303.61122131347656	47
selected for “guest work” in Germany. This procedure resembles the intake	128.6999969482422	567.834716796875	9.47998046875	303.6330108642578	47

tered to the applicants. But it also shows some additional features of checking	128.6999969482422	602.335205078125	9.480010986328125	303.5856475830078	47

He obviously does not check if somebody of the Turkish work personnel is	128.69960021972656	287.81768798828125	9.48004150390625	303.6111602783203	49

During her first year in Germany, Hülya is trapped within the dynamics of a	128.6999969482422	429.8345947265625	9.47998046875	303.60069274902344	51

In Hülya’s case, the normal type of an immigrant’s trajectory means that for	140.03997802734375	487.3155517578125	9.47998046875	292.15179443359375	51

strange, very urging new life predicament. For example, she or he would be	128.69960021972656	161.3355712890625	9.48004150390625	303.5618438720703	53

unexpected necessities. At the same time the immigrant would also be isolated	128.69960021972656	184.3160400390625	9.48004150390625	303.5420379638672	53

communicate with others and would feel alone. In addition, she or he would be	128.69960021972656	207.2965087890625	9.48004150390625	303.6263885498047	53

patterns brought into the new cultural and social situation (SCHÜTZ 1964a).	128.69960021972656	230.336669921875	9.48004150390625	303.5989227294922	53
The immigrant would feel self-alienated by her or his incapacity to follow up	128.69960021972656	241.79705810546875	9.48004150390625	303.6168975830078	53

action possibilities of the new life and labour situation. All of this would be	128.69960021972656	310.79815673828125	9.48004150390625	303.5675506591797	53
quite difficult initially. But after some time, the immigrant would be able to re-	128.69960021972656	322.3182373046875	9.480010986328125	303.6566925048828	53

scheme of earning surplus money and to improve her situation. For example,	128.69960021972656	345.2987060546875	9.47998046875	303.65379333496094	53
Hülya could really start to support her family in Turkey, and in addition to this	128.69960021972656	356.81878662109375	9.47998046875	303.6870880126953	53
she could develop a new biographical action scheme (e.g., to establish her own	128.69960021972656	368.3388671875	9.47998046875	303.6424102783203	53
autonomous existence in Germany). Of course, to a certain extent, she would	128.69960021972656	379.7992248535156	9.47998046875	303.6974639892578	53
remain a cultural stranger. She still would compare her old cultural expecta-	128.69960021972656	391.3193054199219	9.47998046875	303.6272735595703	53

(SCHÜTZ 1964a, 1964b). But as such an “enculturated” stranger she surely	128.69960021972656	414.29974365234375	9.47998046875	303.72401428222656	53
would be able to act autonomously again. In addition, as a cultural hybrid	128.69960021972656	425.81982421875	9.47998046875	303.63966369628906	53
(BHABHA 1994) she increasingly would envision certain opportunities for	128.69960021972656	437.33990478515625	9.47998046875	303.57322692871094	53

she would still suffer from being positioned between the two cultures and so-	128.69960021972656	471.8404235839844	9.47998046875	303.6547393798828	53

of the contract. And in fact, by physical force nobody endangered Hülya’s life at all.—But	137.2193603515625	404.6448059082031	7.980010986328125	295.07403564453125	56
on the other hand, decisive is the fact, that Hülya did not know about such alternatives. She	137.2193603515625	413.8848571777344	7.980010986328125	295.161865234375	56
mistakenly assumed that she was forced to remain in her work position in the slaughter-	137.21934509277344	423.0650634765625	7.980010986328125	294.9918670654297	56

The management of the slaughterhouse systematically reckoned with the ignorance of the	137.2193145751953	441.4853210449219	7.980010986328125	295.06849670410156	56
newly recruited workers and was, thus, able to organize a hermetically closed system of	137.2193145751953	450.66552734375	7.980010986328125	295.10035705566406	56
exploitation of its neophytes. In addition, there seemed to be at least some bit of vague col-	137.21929931640625	459.8457336425781	7.980010986328125	295.0908203125	56

tors and local hospitals tended to look away, to circumvent the ominous establishment, to	137.21929931640625	496.6862487792969	7.980010986328125	295.054931640625	56

morally irresponsible nevertheless. (In this regard Hülya is especially critical about the lo-	137.21934509277344	533.4669189453125	7.980010986328125	295.11402893066406	56

tra work—and at least formally she probably even got some extra pay for it, although it	137.21934509277344	551.827392578125	7.980010986328125	295.23683166503906	56
was, then, factually reduced from her regular pay again. But she was systematically ma-	137.21934509277344	561.0673828125	7.980010986328125	295.0270538330078	56
nipulated to mistakenly assume that there was no alternative from doing that extra work. In	137.21934509277344	570.24755859375	7.980010986328125	294.97828674316406	56

cases of accident Hülya does not receive proper treatment and is forced by the	128.69960021972656	115.31494140625	9.48004150390625	303.54576110839844	58

Hülya assumes to be forced to stay in the slaughterhouse for the first year in	140.03958129882812	172.79595947265625	9.48004150390625	292.1763916015625	58
Germany. She does not have her passport. She is in debt to the firm, since it	128.69960021972656	184.3160400390625	9.48004150390625	303.6453094482422	58
issued her an advance payment to her at the beginning of the contract. Hülya	128.69960021972656	195.83612060546875	9.48004150390625	303.6491241455078	58
thinks that there is no legal escape from the contract and that it is totally impos-	128.69960021972656	207.2965087890625	9.48004150390625	303.67564392089844	58
sible to change from one firm to the other during the first year, the contract	128.69960021972656	218.81658935546875	9.48004150390625	303.6956329345703	58

this assumption when they refuse a slightly premature ending of the one-year	128.69960021972656	241.79705810546875	9.48004150390625	303.56944274902344	58
contract.) It is a nightmare for Hülya to imagine the “worst case scenario”:	128.69960021972656	253.317138671875	9.48004150390625	303.62245178222656	58
being forced to go home without ending the contract and returning to Turkey as	128.69960021972656	264.83721923828125	9.48004150390625	303.6320343017578	58
a failure. (The company probably knows that its Turkish employees do not see	128.69960021972656	276.297607421875	9.48004150390625	303.53819274902344	58
a feasible escape from the situation by returning home to Turkey. Pride, self	128.69960021972656	287.81768798828125	9.48004150390625	303.53916931152344	58

ingly at stake.)	128.69960021972656	310.79815673828125	9.48004150390625	56.26094055175781	58
The compulsory work situation has three features of biographical impact.	140.03958129882812	322.3182373046875	9.480010986328125	292.2654724121094	58
First, it isolates the persons in the same predicament from each other. At the	128.69960021972656	333.8383483886719	9.47998046875	303.5542449951172	58
beginning of Hülya’s stay there is no solidarity of mutual help and consolation	128.69960021972656	345.2987060546875	9.47998046875	303.5153045654297	58
between the newcomers and the other dormitory dwellers and co-workers.	128.69960021972656	356.81878662109375	9.47998046875	303.51441955566406	58
Second, it is a life and work situation of extreme humiliation: Hülya knows	128.69960021972656	368.3388671875	9.47998046875	303.61866760253906	58
about her exploitation—too much and too hard work and far too little pay—but	128.69960021972656	379.7992248535156	9.47998046875	303.62071228027344	58
she cannot change it. Her central biographical problem is to be forced into a	128.69960021972656	391.3193054199219	9.47998046875	303.6405487060547	58
situation that is unjust and unfair. Moreover, her situation makes little sense	128.69960021972656	402.8393859863281	9.47998046875	303.6822967529297	58
with respect to her former biographical action scheme of supporting her family	128.69960021972656	414.29974365234375	9.47998046875	303.6367645263672	58
in Turkey. She realises that her suffering is not only an everyday burden, but	128.69960021972656	425.81982421875	9.47998046875	303.62074279785156	58
also does not matter in terms of future biographical developments and perspec-	128.69960021972656	437.33990478515625	9.47998046875	303.54481506347656	58
tives. Hülya feels and fears to be seen as a grumbler after she has been injured	128.69960021972656	448.8002624511719	9.47998046875	303.5628204345703	58
by the two work accidents and complaining about them and the pain involved.	128.69960021972656	460.3203430175781	9.47998046875	303.65003967285156	58
Her me-images (MEAD 1934) are impaired. She would like to be seen as a	128.69960021972656	471.8404235839844	9.47998046875	303.63294982910156	58
hard efficient worker and she feels to be approached like a malingerer. Third,	128.69960021972656	483.30078125	9.47998046875	303.5978546142578	58
Hülya is forced to postpone learning German and being socialized into German	128.69960021972656	494.82086181640625	9.47998046875	303.6149444580078	58

mans (even buying groceries is difficult, since she has to work from 6 to 22	128.69960021972656	517.80126953125	9.47998046875	303.5363006591797	58

tion or the union provide related opportunities or support.) In addition, there	128.69960021972656	552.3018188476562	9.47998046875	303.5192108154297	58
might be an emotional barrier to learn the language and culture of a society in	128.69960021972656	563.8218994140625	9.47998046875	303.5884552001953	58
which such a despicable systematic work situation of unfairness, loss of bio-	128.69960021972656	575.3419799804688	9.47998046875	303.65858459472656	58
graphical sense, and personal humiliation is possible. It is remarkable that	128.69960021972656	586.8023681640625	9.480010986328125	303.63490295410156	58
Hülya learns German and gets into German culture only eight years later, when	128.69960021972656	598.3224487304688	9.479995727539062	303.68995666503906	58

she seriously considers building a life in Germany rather than in Turkey and	128.69960021972656	115.31494140625	9.48004150390625	303.5600128173828	60
after going through a pre-arranged marriage and her divorce. The delay of	128.69960021972656	126.83502197265625	9.48004150390625	303.64906311035156	60
learning German and getting involved in German culture might be due not only	128.69960021972656	138.29541015625	9.48004150390625	303.6708221435547	60

quite important in legal terms, because for them Hülya and her roommates	128.6999969482422	498.8368225097656	9.47998046875	303.70130920410156	62

Hülya also becomes aware of the social base of sisterly solidarity and mutual	128.69960021972656	253.317138671875	9.48004150390625	303.62254333496094	64

separated from her own family of origin. Hülya starts to understand—and later	128.69956970214844	391.3193054199219	9.47998046875	303.61119079589844	64

The private accommodation situation of Hülya is difficult, too. She has to	140.03958129882812	149.81549072265625	9.48004150390625	292.1745300292969	70

just work and salary oriented. In Hülya’s view, these old and worn out guest	128.6995849609375	333.8383483886719	9.47998046875	303.65386962890625	70
workers became personally isolated exactly by losing the social ties of family	128.6995849609375	345.2987060546875	9.47998046875	303.63677978515625	70
and friendship networks in their country of origin. In addition, from the point	128.6995849609375	356.81878662109375	9.47998046875	303.6557922363281	70
of view of Hülya, their ability to relate to interaction partners in Germany with	128.6995849609375	368.3388671875	9.47998046875	303.6443786621094	70

too, because they did not understand that a substitution of the lost family ties	128.6995849609375	391.3193054199219	9.47998046875	303.6300964355469	70

engaging oneself in Turkish and/or German voluntary associations, of finding	128.6995849609375	414.29974365234375	9.47998046875	303.6272888183594	70

One has to take into account that here Hülya is using a common Turkish	140.03958129882812	494.82086181640625	9.47998046875	292.18115234375	70

bers of concentration camps (l.455). But nevertheless, the biographical suffer-	128.6996307373047	391.3193054199219	9.47998046875	303.6984100341797	72

situation seems to be even worse. Hülya marks the working-through of this	128.6996307373047	414.29974365234375	9.47998046875	303.5912628173828	72
suffering as one of the important “switch stations” of her managing her migrant	128.6996307373047	425.81982421875	9.47998046875	303.61119079589844	72
worker trajectory. She delineates that experience and the biographical suffering	128.6996307373047	437.33990478515625	9.47998046875	303.5239715576172	72
connected to it as a “hard blow” for her (l.512); she cries all the time (l.518),	128.6996307373047	448.8002624511719	9.47998046875	303.6680145263672	72
and the janitor admonishes her that her permanent crying would finally kill her	128.6996307373047	460.3203430175781	9.47998046875	303.66050720214844	72
(ll.527-528).	128.6996307373047	471.8404235839844	9.47998046875	48.06927490234375	72
There are three reasons for the utter bleakness of Hülya’s second work tra-	140.03961181640625	483.30078125	9.47998046875	292.0853576660156	72
jectory experience: First, Hülya had hoped to escape from the trajectory trap of	128.6996307373047	494.82086181640625	9.47998046875	303.5723114013672	72
exploitative and alienating work when leaving the slaughterhouse for chicken.	128.6996307373047	506.3409423828125	9.47998046875	303.5570831298828	72
Understandably, she had assumed that her first work situation in Germany	128.6996307373047	517.80126953125	9.47998046875	303.52015686035156	72
would be extraordinary through its open illegality and coercion. Now she has to	128.6996307373047	529.3214111328125	9.47998046875	303.6187286376953	72
realise that even under correct legal conditions the dynamics of the trajectory of	128.6996307373047	540.8414306640625	9.47998046875	303.6415252685547	72
exploitative and alienating work, in which migrant workers in Germany can be	128.6996307373047	552.3018188476562	9.47998046875	303.7078399658203	72
entrapped, goes on and on. She also has to acknowledge, that this trajectory	128.6996307373047	563.8218994140625	9.47998046875	303.6197052001953	72
dynamics and its organisational structural context are an overwhelmingly well	128.6996307373047	575.3419799804688	9.47998046875	303.62547302246094	72
organised system, and that her chances for escaping them are small. Second, in	128.6996307373047	586.8023681640625	9.480010986328125	303.6964569091797	72
her second work position and the housing connected to it Hülya feels even	128.6996307373047	598.3224487304688	9.479995727539062	303.59791564941406	72

more isolated than in her first work and dwelling situation, since she lost her	128.69960021972656	115.31494140625	9.48004150390625	303.56944274902344	74
young solidarity group of sisterly Turkish roommates. Third—and this is the	128.69960021972656	126.83502197265625	9.48004150390625	303.5894012451172	74
most important reason—Hülya envisions, looking at her future life course, how	128.69960021972656	138.29541015625	9.48004150390625	303.67567443847656	74
her own biographical identity could develop, when she would permanently	128.69960021972656	149.81549072265625	9.48004150390625	303.5769805908203	74
remain as an isolated migrant worker in Germany. She looks into the mirror	128.69960021972656	161.3355712890625	9.48004150390625	303.6783905029297	74
image of older women who underwent the isolated migrant worker trajectory	128.69960021972656	172.79595947265625	9.48004150390625	303.6405487060547	74
for extended periods of their lives. She realises the mechanisms of becoming	128.69960021972656	184.3160400390625	9.48004150390625	303.65953063964844	74
alienated from one’s own identity connected with that isolated migrant worker	128.69960021972656	195.83612060546875	9.48004150390625	303.66896057128906	74
trajectory. Of course, she stresses in her argumentative commentary (ll.515-	128.69960021972656	207.2965087890625	9.48004150390625	303.61878967285156	74
522) that she is different in terms of her essential features of identity “lay-out”	128.69960021972656	218.81658935546875	9.48004150390625	303.5770721435547	74
as inherited from her family and home culture. But when she explains that she	128.69960021972656	230.336669921875	9.48004150390625	303.58177185058594	74
is “still sentimental, sensible today” she insinuates that she has already gotten	128.69960021972656	241.79705810546875	9.48004150390625	303.53721618652344	74
hardened, too (l.519). It is a nightmare for her to imagine, that she could be-	128.69960021972656	253.317138671875	9.48004150390625	303.59791564941406	74
come just a working machine and—connected to it—could get utterly selfish	128.69960021972656	264.83721923828125	9.48004150390625	303.5476837158203	74
and materialistic like the older women with whom she lives. She realises the	128.69960021972656	276.297607421875	9.48004150390625	303.6216278076172	74
danger of losing her own biographical identity by a systematic process of self-	128.69960021972656	287.81768798828125	9.48004150390625	303.5827178955078	74
alienation connected to the isolated migrant worker trajectory. Now she knows	128.69960021972656	299.3377685546875	9.48004150390625	303.6017303466797	74
that she has to make a serious attempt to change her life situation drastically.	128.69960021972656	310.79815673828125	9.48004150390625	303.7154083251953	74
This is her next step of biographical work: to analyse the isolated migrant	128.69960021972656	322.3182373046875	9.480010986328125	303.5920867919922	74
worker’s trajectory and to decide to hinder such a gloomy development by	128.69960021972656	333.8383483886719	9.47998046875	303.59788513183594	74
searching for a way out.	128.69960021972656	345.2987060546875	9.47998046875	91.59385681152344	74

escape from the isolated migrant worker’s trajectory (ll.546-573,	131.52037048339844	387.4710998535156	11.519989013671875	297.9878692626953	75

Not earlier than almost two years after her coming to Germany Hülya is able to	128.6999969482422	419.8146057128906	9.47998046875	303.56187438964844	76
go on a vacation to Turkey. Only then her mother fully realises how much her	128.6999969482422	431.3346862792969	9.47998046875	303.55625915527344	76
daughter has suffered: she is only a shadow of herself, having lost 40 pounds.	128.6999969482422	442.7950439453125	9.47998046875	303.58177185058594	76
And Hülya, in turn, realises how much her mother, too, has suffered from her	128.6999969482422	454.31512451171875	9.47998046875	303.5705108642578	76
being abroad: she became severely ill immediately after Hülya’s leaving for	128.6999969482422	465.835205078125	9.47998046875	303.5192108154297	76
Germany. During her stay at home mother and daughter—perhaps the whole	128.6999969482422	477.2955627441406	9.47998046875	303.6328887939453	76
family—must have understood that Hülya would not have a realistic chance to	128.6999969482422	488.8156433105469	9.47998046875	303.6859588623047	76
become affluent in Germany and that her worker’s existence in Germany might	128.6999969482422	500.3357238769531	9.47998046875	303.58177185058594	76
be connected to too much suffering. And note again, that immediately before,	128.6999969482422	511.79608154296875	9.47998046875	303.6689910888672	76
while still in Germany, Hülya had detected for herself the danger of becoming	128.6999969482422	523.316162109375	9.47998046875	303.67469787597656	76
estranged from herself by permanently remaining entrapped in the isolated	128.6999969482422	534.8362426757812	9.47998046875	303.55616760253906	76
migrant worker’s trajectory in the future. The double insight of Hülya, on the	128.6999969482422	546.296630859375	9.47998046875	303.5599822998047	76
one hand, and of her family on the other, and the communicative exchange	128.6999969482422	557.816650390625	9.47998046875	303.5826873779297	76
about it between Hülya and her family, especially between Hülya and her	128.6999969482422	569.3367919921875	9.47998046875	303.7173614501953	76
mother, must have been followed by thinking about a marriage for Hülya dur-	128.6999969482422	580.797119140625	9.480010986328125	303.61976623535156	76

During her next visit to Turkey, two years later (in 1976), Hülya gets mar-	140.03956604003906	115.31494140625	9.48004150390625	292.2665557861328	78
ried to a relative belonging to the maternal part of her own extended family.	128.6995849609375	126.83502197265625	9.48004150390625	303.5685729980469	78
Hülya explains that she did not love her cousin (“...well, that was	128.6995849609375	138.29541015625	9.48004150390625	303.6377258300781	78
...no...marriage with great love”—ll.556). And at the same time she conveys	128.6995849609375	149.8145751953125	9.48095703125	303.57666015625	78
two other tacit considerations that don’t really fit well with each other: that	128.70022583007812	161.33465576171875	9.48004150390625	303.5932312011719	78
there was no alternative marriage candidate available and that she generally	128.70022583007812	172.7950439453125	9.48004150390625	303.5647888183594	78

much either or something.”—ll.556-557), since she was still exhausted and	128.70022583007812	195.835205078125	9.48004150390625	303.5704650878906	78
suffering from her trajectory experience of an isolated migrant worker who did	128.70022583007812	207.29559326171875	9.48004150390625	303.6405944824219	78

more, having already started to do the biographical work of one’s own life	128.70022583007812	241.796142578125	9.48004150390625	303.6320495605469	78
historical personalisation and individualisation. The young couple remained	128.70022583007812	253.31622314453125	9.48004150390625	303.6092224121094	78
together only for one week (ll.697). Hülya gets a first impression even at the	128.70022583007812	264.8363037109375	9.48004150390625	303.62530517578125	78

during the one week of living together Hülya realises the difference between a	128.70022583007812	322.31732177734375	9.480010986328125	303.5808410644531	78

It becomes clear from Hülya’s way of storytelling that her return to Turkey	140.0395965576172	368.3347473144531	9.47998046875	292.2598419189453	78

accordance with her biographical insight into the migrant worker’s trajectory of	128.69961547851562	402.83526611328125	9.47998046875	303.6167907714844	78
exhausting exploitation, of getting culturally alienated and of losing one’s own	128.69961547851562	414.2956237792969	9.47998046875	303.6283264160156	78
personal identity—an insight, she could win by looking into the mirror image	128.69961547851562	425.8157043457031	9.47998046875	303.62255859375	78
of the older women living with Hülya in the same dormitory connected to her	128.69961547851562	437.3357849121094	9.47998046875	303.6224365234375	78
second job. Hülya envisions her marriage as a biographical action scheme of	128.69961547851562	448.796142578125	9.47998046875	303.5125427246094	78
escaping from the exploitation and self-alienation trajectory of the isolated	128.69961547851562	460.31622314453125	9.47998046875	303.5780029296875	78

But due to her experiences on the marriage day and in the following week of	140.0395965576172	483.2966613769531	9.47998046875	292.2057342529297	78
living together, Hülya develops the action plan of returning to Germany for one	128.69961547851562	494.8167419433594	9.47998046875	303.6680908203125	78
year; two years are not allowed by the parents by law and by her own mother.	128.69961547851562	506.3367919921875	9.47998046875	303.50213623046875	78
Hülya gives as the official explanation for her action plan of returning to Ger-	128.69961547851562	517.7971801757812	9.47998046875	303.634033203125	78
many that she would like to earn the money for and buy electrical household	128.69961547851562	529.3172607421875	9.47998046875	303.61968994140625	78
equipment and other household goods in order to let her future children learn	128.69961547851562	540.8373413085938	9.47998046875	303.725830078125	78
about the former migrant worker’s life of their mother (ll.565-570). Both rea-	128.69961547851562	552.2977294921875	9.47998046875	303.6927795410156	78
sons given are not false; to the contrary, they are biographically plausible, and	128.69961547851562	563.8177490234375	9.47998046875	303.6102600097656	78
they underline the life historical and individualized attitude of Hülya to her	128.69961547851562	575.337890625	9.47998046875	303.6329650878906	78
own life. But on the other hand, these two reasons, why Hülya should return to	128.69961547851562	586.7982177734375	9.480010986328125	303.5874328613281	78

legal marriage partner. The change of her mind—first she plans to stay in Tur-	128.69960021972656	115.31494140625	9.48004150390625	303.6433868408203	80
key with her husband and not to return to Germany, and then she develops the	128.69960021972656	126.83502197265625	9.48004150390625	303.67652893066406	80
action plan to return to Germany to earn additional money in order to buy	128.69960021972656	138.29541015625	9.48004150390625	303.6405792236328	80
household equipment—is only understandable by assuming that she has second	128.69960021972656	149.81549072265625	9.48004150390625	303.62730407714844	80
thoughts about her marriage and wants to stay apart from it for a while in order	128.69960021972656	161.3355712890625	9.48004150390625	303.50404357910156	80
to reconsider it.	128.69960021972656	172.79595947265625	9.48004150390625	59.40736389160156	80
After her return to Germany Hülya becomes severely ill for a year, and	140.03958129882812	184.3160400390625	9.48004150390625	292.3148498535156	80
when she comes home again to Turkey one year later, she is still so weak that	128.6995849609375	195.83612060546875	9.48004150390625	303.419677734375	80
in the beginning of her time there she can only stay with her mother. Not earlier	128.6995849609375	207.2965087890625	9.48004150390625	303.71832275390625	80
than during her last week in Turkey she finally visits her husband, who lives	128.6995849609375	218.81658935546875	9.48004150390625	303.6320495605469	80
quite far from Hülya’s parents. Hülya’s in-laws feel insulted by her late visit to	128.6995849609375	230.336669921875	9.48004150390625	303.5628356933594	80
her husband, and he himself blames her for not having visited him immediately	128.6995849609375	241.79705810546875	9.48004150390625	303.6794128417969	80
after her arrival in Turkey and for not returning from Germany even earlier.	128.6995849609375	253.317138671875	9.48004150390625	303.6614990234375	80
Hülya is very disappointed that he does not ask her about her health situation	128.6995849609375	264.83721923828125	9.48004150390625	303.60455322265625	80
and her suffering at all. Such a deeply felt attitude of compassion would have	128.6995849609375	276.297607421875	9.48004150390625	303.63385009765625	80
been the only road for rapprochement and transgressing the conventional ex-	128.6995849609375	287.81768798828125	9.48004150390625	303.580810546875	80
pectation patterns of traditional gender relating and family life. But it is obvi-	128.6995849609375	299.3377685546875	9.48004150390625	303.71551513671875	80
ous that Hülya’s husband is trapped into the mold of traditional male conduct.	128.6995849609375	310.79815673828125	9.48004150390625	296.4642639160156	80
Hülya returns to Germany again not keeping the promise to stay with her	140.03956604003906	322.3182373046875	9.480010986328125	292.26832580566406	80
husband. After some argumentative letter exchanges during the following year	128.6995849609375	333.8383483886719	9.47998046875	303.564697265625	80
she decides to get a divorce from him since she acknowledges that he as a very	128.6995849609375	345.2987060546875	9.47998046875	303.5619201660156	80
traditional man with his conventional ideas about male pride is totally unfit to	128.6995849609375	356.81878662109375	9.47998046875	303.5543212890625	80
serve as an understanding husband of an individualised young woman having	128.6995849609375	368.3388671875	9.47998046875	303.4907531738281	80
lived alone for a long time. Hülya follows up her action scheme of getting the	128.6995849609375	379.7992248535156	9.47998046875	303.61590576171875	80
divorce, although her in-laws and even her own mother implore her to stay in	128.6995849609375	391.3193054199219	9.47998046875	303.6263122558594	80
the marriage. Through her autonomous action scheme of getting the divorce	128.6995849609375	402.8393859863281	9.47998046875	303.59228515625	80
Hülya emancipates herself from traditional rural Turkish family culture with all	128.6995849609375	414.29974365234375	9.47998046875	303.5543212890625	80
its responsibilities and expectations. She pursues this against the deep wishes of	128.6995849609375	425.81982421875	9.47998046875	303.81878662109375	80
her own mother. The dissent and emotional cleavage between mother and	128.6995849609375	437.33990478515625	9.47998046875	303.6623840332031	80
daughter must have been very difficult for Hülya since she loves her mother so	128.6995849609375	448.8002624511719	9.47998046875	303.6595153808594	80
dearly, and she always kept a close emotional bond with her. But here, on the	128.6995849609375	460.3203430175781	9.47998046875	303.61492919921875	80
other hand, she has to notice and to accept a dramatic difference of the outlook	128.6995849609375	471.8404235839844	9.47998046875	303.5457458496094	80
