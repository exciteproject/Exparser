2. Understanding Democracy	72.02400207519531	100.56304931640625	11.03997802734375	132.94847106933594	22
In political theory, „democracy‟ is described as a political philosophy, but also as a form of governing, where	108.0199966430664	113.16302490234375	11.03997802734375	432.1971664428711	22
the governing power lies in the hands of people, and it may be exercised either in an immediate (direct democracy)	72.02400207519531	125.7630615234375	11.03997802734375	468.05516052246094	22
or intermediate manner (indirect democracy), i.e. according to the principle of presentation and representation of	72.02400207519531	138.363037109375	11.03997802734375	467.7537078857422	22
interests realized by virtue of free and fair elections. Modern or contemporary interpretation of democracy is	72.02400207519531	150.9630126953125	11.03997802734375	468.1091766357422	22
connected with the philosophical principle of equal rights. Hence, the notion of democracy is occasionally used in the	72.02400207519531	163.56304931640625	11.03997802734375	467.7206268310547	22
context of liberal democracy, which on the other hand implies existence of certain additional elements, such as	72.02400207519531	176.28302001953125	11.03997802734375	467.67649841308594	22
political pluralism, equality before the law, civil freedoms and civil rights. Furthermore, these elements represent	72.02400207519531	188.883056640625	11.03997802734375	468.0762176513672	22
parameters regarding the level of democracy within society (Atanasov and Cvetanova, 2013: 27).	72.02400207519531	201.4830322265625	11.03997802734375	387.25718688964844	22
Different scholars define „democracy‟ in different ways. Definitions of democracy are often influenced by the	108.0199966430664	214.0830078125	11.03997802734375	432.1212387084961	22
aspect they emphasize. For example: some of the definitions focus on the institutions and procedures of democratic	72.02400207519531	226.68304443359375	11.03997802734375	468.1409149169922	22
governance, others on political aspect i.e. freedom and liberties, and still others take into account the social	72.02400207519531	239.40301513671875	11.03997802734375	468.0679168701172	22
dimension, i.e. social benefits.	72.02400207519531	252.03302001953125	11.03997802734375	120.4068603515625	22
These three broad alternatives – institutions and procedures, freedom and liberties, and social benefits –	108.0199966430664	264.633056640625	11.03997802734375	432.1942367553711	22
constitute the primary substantive choices in defining democracy. Certainly people will offer other responses if asked	72.02400207519531	277.2330322265625	11.040008544921875	468.07579040527344	22
to define democracy spontaneously. Yet the extent to which democracy is defined in terms of these three broad	72.02400207519531	289.8330383300781	11.040008544921875	467.7316131591797	22
choices provides a framework to assess the high levels of public support for democracy in recent public-opinion	72.02400207519531	302.43304443359375	11.040008544921875	468.1691131591797	22
surveys and the implications of these democratic aspirations. Each alternative has different implications for the	72.02400207519531	315.1530456542969	11.040008544921875	467.7869110107422	22
interpretation of public opinion toward democracy and the principles that guide the democratization process (Dalton,	72.02400207519531	327.7530212402344	11.040008544921875	467.74278259277344	22
Shin, and Jou, 2007: 145).	72.02400207519531	340.35302734375	11.040008544921875	105.95314025878906	22
Despite many definitions and different approaches in defining democracy, political theory highlights three	108.0199966430664	352.9530334472656	11.040008544921875	431.71932220458984	22
pillars that underpin democracy: transparency, accountability and right to participate. Therefore, citizen participation –	72.02400207519531	365.55303955078125	11.040008544921875	468.1902313232422	22
as one of the three pillars - is regarded widely as vital to democracy. The classic Kantian distinction between active	72.02400207519531	378.2730407714844	11.040008544921875	468.00535583496094	22
and passive citizens implies that only those citizens who in one way or another actively participate in decision-making	72.02400207519531	390.873046875	11.040008544921875	468.18980407714844	22
are indeed different from the subjects of a nondemocratic polity (Weinrib, 2008).	72.02400207519531	403.4730224609375	11.040008544921875	318.5607147216797	22
Free and active participation and involvement of citizens in the political life of any country is the principal	108.0199966430664	416.0730285644531	11.040008544921875	431.5316390991211	22
characteristic of democracy. When it comes to contemporary democratic systems, citizens are allowed to discuss	72.02400207519531	428.6930236816406	11.040008544921875	468.1366424560547	22
freely their problems, express and voice their dissatisfaction and complaints and request changes. (Atanasov,	72.02400207519531	441.29302978515625	11.040008544921875	467.7428436279297	22
Cvetanova, 2013: 33).	72.02400207519531	454.0130310058594	11.040008544921875	88.90512084960938	22
Citizen participation may be defined as a process in which ordinary people take part – whether on a	108.0199966430664	466.613037109375	11.040008544921875	432.16878509521484	22
voluntary or obligatory basis and whether acting alone or as part of a group – with the goal of influencing a decision	72.02400207519531	479.2130432128906	11.040008544921875	467.8833465576172	22
involving significant choices that will affect their community. Such participation may or may not take place within an	72.02400207519531	491.8130187988281	11.040008544921875	467.61021423339844	22
institutional framework, and it may be organized either by members of civil society (for example, through class action,	72.02400207519531	504.4129943847656	11.040008544921875	467.8321990966797	22
demonstrations citizens‟ committees, etc.) or by decision makers (for example, through referendums, parliamentary	72.02400207519531	517.133056640625	11.040008544921875	467.7206268310547	22
commissions and mediation (André, 2010).	72.02400207519531	529.7330322265625	11.040008544921875	171.72103881835938	22
Civic activism refers to citizens‟ involvement on a voluntary basis in civic activities related to community,	108.0199966430664	542.3330078125	11.040008544921875	431.7352523803711	22
often connected with duties and obligations, but also associated with membership in civic organizations as well as	72.02400207519531	554.9329833984375	11.040008544921875	467.6765594482422	22

In the following chapter, attitudes towards democracy of Macedonian students will be analyzed from the	108.0199966430664	580.133056640625	11.040008544921875	432.1731185913086	22

For reasons pertaining to the project goals, and in order to examine attitudes towards democracy of the	108.0199966430664	643.2830810546875	11.040008544921875	431.9901351928711	23
student population in the Republic of Macedonia, a questionnaire – divided into logical groups – has been designed.	72.02400207519531	656.0030517578125	11.039993286132812	462.15806579589844	23
The first group of questions obtained data for the student‟ interest in politics: “How often they talk about	108.0199966430664	668.6030883789062	11.039993286132812	432.11348724365234	23
political issues”, and “What is their ideological affiliation”.	72.02400207519531	681.2030639648438	11.039993286132812	225.69227600097656	23

may be interpreted in two ways. The students are insufficiently informed and educated with regard to the basic	72.02400207519531	571.9730224609375	11.040008544921875	468.1514129638672	68

stage in the Republic of Macedonia. Namely, even though they are very precise concerning their ideological affiliation	72.02400207519531	609.802978515625	11.040008544921875	468.0383758544922	68
in their respective political platforms, when it comes to their activities, they do not always adhere to their policies (in	72.02400207519531	622.5230712890625	11.040008544921875	467.61021423339844	68
