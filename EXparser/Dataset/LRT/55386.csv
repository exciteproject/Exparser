Abstract: The objective of the research is to identify the reality of integrating the dimensions of computerized health	72.02400207519531	235.6033935546875	9.96002197265625	467.6593475341797	13
information systems in Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex. The researchers used the questionnaire method to collect	72.02400207519531	247.15338134765625	9.96002197265625	467.8939666748047	13
data. The researchers used the random stratified sample method, where 30 samples were distributed to test the	72.02400207519531	258.67340087890625	9.96002197265625	467.61741638183594	13
internal consistency, structural validity and consistency of the questionnaire. After verifying the validity and	72.02400207519531	270.19342041015625	9.96002197265625	467.6020965576172	13
reliability of the questionnaire for the test, (220) questionnaires were distributed to the study community. A total of	72.02400207519531	281.71343994140625	9.959991455078125	467.8813934326172	13
197 responses were retrieved with a return rate equal to (89.5%).	72.02400207519531	293.1134338378906	9.959991455078125	263.0038604736328	13
The results showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the averages of the sample of the	72.02400207519531	304.6334228515625	9.959991455078125	467.4728240966797	13
study on these areas and the domains combined due to the variables of (gender), (qualification), (place of work),	72.02400207519531	316.1534423828125	9.959991455078125	467.39781188964844	13

Table (3) shows that 73.6% of the study sample is male, while the remaining 26.4% is female. The researchers	72.02400207519531	609.4833984375	9.960006713867188	467.7434539794922	99
attributed this to the fact that the Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex is the main compound in the Gaza Strip and there	72.02400207519531	621.00341796875	9.960006713867188	467.5079803466797	99

50 years, 10.7% (50 years) and more. The researchers attribute this to the diversity of the average age, which	72.02400207519531	84.52337646484375	9.96002197265625	467.6719207763672	103
indicates the availability of expertise. It is also noticed that 79.3% of the study population is less than (50) years old,	72.02400207519531	96.04339599609375	9.96002197265625	467.66368103027344	103

their work is a health administration. The researchers attribute this to the fact that Dar Al-Shifa Medical Complex is	72.02400207519531	176.44342041015625	9.96002197265625	468.01316833496094	103

If Sig <0.05 (Sig is greater than 0.05), the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. In this case, the average of the	72.02400207519531	440.9734191894531	9.959991455078125	467.46275329589844	103
individuals' opinions on the phenomenon studied is not substantially different from the average degree of approval	72.02400207519531	452.4934387207031	9.959991455078125	467.83360290527344	103
(3). 0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted that the average views of	72.02400207519531	464.013427734375	9.959991455078125	467.41294860839844	103
individuals differ substantially from the average approval level (3). In this case, it is possible to determine whether	72.02400207519531	475.5334167480469	9.959991455078125	467.8212127685547	103
the average response substantially increases or decreases the degree of intermediate approval. By means of the value	72.02400207519531	487.0534362792969	9.959991455078125	467.38304138183594	103
of the test. If the value of the test is positive, it means that the arithmetic mean of the answer exceeds the degree of	72.02400207519531	498.57342529296875	9.959991455078125	467.9324188232422	103
